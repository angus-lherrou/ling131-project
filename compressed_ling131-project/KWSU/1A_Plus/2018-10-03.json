U. dot org and we had been hearing from so many of you want to listeners primarily women\nWith the insanity friends laugh at my posted insinuate that I've lost it and you know what I have\nI have lost my inability to be quiet in the face of gross injustice and Joan emailed us I'm sixty five and I was in college with the first feminist resurgence is the world the usa ready for women's anger that's like asking African Americans when will the world be ready for their anger the answer never\nPower doesn't seed without a fight don't even ask the question the question itself\nIs demanding and peg in Traverse City email this on a conservative woman that is angry that someone could be assumed guilty\nBased on unproven allegations I'm angry at the assumption that all American women or antique having a pro choice liberal and progressive I'm a proud American woman who's also conservative pro life pro Cavanaugh I Am an American woman to\nNow Rebecca Traister you started to paint a picture of the history of women who've gotten angry and made their mark their anger is not always shown in the same form as somebody yelling in the face of a senator like Jeff Flake on live TV but anger nonetheless and Brittany Cooper you've written a book\nAbout finding your power in rage uh tell me a little bit about that theme in how the story fits into the moment\n[noise] a shore so part of what happens is that women are told on as many of your listeners say that to be angry it to be irrational\nAnd I had a student when I was a graduate instructor confront me and said to me that she loved to listen to me lecture\nBecause my lectures were filled with what she called the most eloquent rage ever and it was a wake up call for me as someone who had run away from the angry black woman stereotype my whole life because I didn't want to be discredited as a black woman moving through predominantly white institutions\nAnd so my student who was a young black woman saw me a kind\nOf authenticity and she helped me to realize that my anger wasn't\nKeeping me from doing my job are showing up are offering quality lectures are material or material but then it was actually helping me to do a better job and so in that moment I made a connection that I've been encouraging\nOther women to make which is ... knowledge that we have the right to outrage and some reject ideas that said that when we're angry about legitimate injustices that this in some way make the irrational or makes our claims illegitimate and when we then begins\nAll of that anger doesn't mean that we become destructive or\nHarmful it means that we happen to the energy and power and we've\nChange that's very scary a trajectory of this historical moment we have a lot to be afraid about or we have a lot to be angry about opposite that anger is the catalyst for being able to do something about the things we see\nNow what's move from the Senate committee hearing room\nOr in the hallways around the Senate um and even the books that are esteemed authors have bring onto the tennis court and the U.S open for another moment that American shared within the last couple of weeks Serena Williams in her match against Naomi Osaka at the U.S open here's a cut I'll bring you back there to refresh my memory\nOf anger on the court Serena Williams infamous exchange with umpire Carlos Ramos\n[noise]\nSuresh I'm Shawnee you shared this moment along with the rest of America is arena is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who founded that anger a weaponized against her\n[noise] Ah yes I think that what we saw in their response was everything that Brittany in Tribeca and I have been talking about it was interesting because\nThere are so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not facing the same policing or penalties mean she\nShe was a defined that was levied against her is the highest ever for verbal abuse in the history of the U. S. open I Believe\nAnd so in that moment there were two very distinct responses if there was sponsors of the people\nThat really just wanted to see her in isolation acting um it and this exchange with this man but then there were people who really looked at that exchange within the much broader context of\nThe power dynamics in the moment and the history and the context and the legacy\nOf discrimination within the sport that she has faced and so I think that one thing that has been unexplored in the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine in understanding women as\nLeaders or at people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict um what she was really doing was I'm asserting her right to defend herself and to have dignity\nI think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so a generation of role models who have benefited from title nine and the lessons of title nine we ... we tend to think of it as\nA athletics but it is really about leadership and the ability to act together um in teams to manage conflict to make the nuance distinctions between being assertive and being aggression and be aggressive and being angry\nI think we're seeing the ... of of that now in our political live there\nWere some pushback though to Serena Williams behavior on the court and the reaction to it even from within the tennis world a Brittany Cooper I I don't know if you saw Martina Navratilova as response to this arena Williams episode a couple of days later but she wrote an op ed after the U.S open and she said Martina speaking now\nSaid yes women are treated differently yes there are double standards but Serino was wrong her encore behavior was inappropriate and I'm paraphrasing just because men rage and umpires and act like babies on the court doesn't make it right and a champion Serena should not emulate it\nI'm Martina Navratilova was wrong\nOr she did this thing that women are conditioned to do which is rather than use it as a moment of solidarity she tried police arena conduct I'm as a lifelong\nTennis fan I'm I Am living but Martina Navratilova reminded me that up until this moment\nMost white women in tennis have not been allies of the Williams sisters um do when I watch tennis with my friends who are African American tennis fan we often talk about watching these matches on you because of the micro aggressions that come from white women\nWho are often knocking at the Williams sisters and having things to say but let me also add\nThat one of the things that was most infuriating about watching the way in which Ramos treated Serena was that there was a broader context to her anger not only did he accuse her of cheating\nBut this also came out on the heels of report that members of the USDA had been showing up to her house\nUnannounced and testing her over and over again on grounds that maybe she was doping even though she has come clean on every drug tested even those statistics show\nThat they were testing her double the amount that they were testing any other players on the women's side and so she had been subjected to repeated indignities and then as the best tennis player\nOf her generation and perhaps ever see then has a referee pulled accuses her\nEra and that is indicative of the\nKinds of theory that we're talking about the ways that women are disrespected daily have their contributions and their qualifications undermined and then when they finally explode there were flaws in your behavior was inappropriate and what I Want to challenge folks and think about is not what happened\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the main office of tourism offering traveled there is an

about the power of women's anger in the current moment in America\nWhere I'm Talking with Rebecca Traister for New York magazine and the cut author of good and mad Britney Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage and also ... director of the women's media center speech project and author of the new book\nRage becomes her now I read an email from Karen at the end of the last segment that said she was hurt disappointed and angry wounded about the treatment of Hillary Clinton in the twenties sixteen campaign and I want to go there because Hillary Clinton is one prominent famous\nWoman well known for navigating the shoulders of how women are supposed to express themselves in public now Hillary Clinton\nHas a history of being\nVery careful and very deliberate mindful of appearing angry or emotional she's been at it for thirty five years in America and in fact it was news in the two thousand and eight campaign I remember this when she shed a tear in New Hampshire one tier and it was at the top of CNN for like a new cycle and a half\nSo now a lot of people are saying that the twenty sixteen presidential campaign I'm Hillary Clinton in fact was was tone police listen\nI regret deeply\nHow angry [noise]\nThe tone of the campaign became [noise]\nNot\nYour fault says one audience member when when Hillary Clinton very deliberately in that in Hillary fashion says I regret how nasty the campaign became I'm ... I'm only does this moment has clearly struck a chord Rebecca Traister who's\nLaughing here in the studio with me but how does that strike you [laughter] know she was she was she was very very careful in her choice of words there to even as she was commenting on it I mean\nI think it was um\nIt was ridiculous that this woman was called an authentic while being held to the standard of\nFull control in her voice and her facial parents in her body and her motives expression I mean the two candidates\nAnd on hinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they could pound podium Z you know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was a gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card right there were all of these\nConversations about I'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender\nUm and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign\nRecord ... is so right about this and I'm In fact\nThe thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton\nBoth Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political pressed for their particular skill and channeling the anger of their supporters this was their gift they were able to give voice to this frustration and\nWe were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion and yet every time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said\nYou're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ... a a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough sad smile is if it was like some cat color on the street smile more\nUm she was told that regularly\nAnd I think that that's again an example of of not having that tool to wield she also had done remarkable writing and talking herself\nIn instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in our own memoir of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that second debate where Donald Trump came up behind\nHer and kind of loomed behind her and how menacing and aggressive his body language was and how during\nThe debate a presidential debate she was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but that she was thinking no no no that's gonna redound negatively to me that's gonna make me\nLook bad it's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story tells us about how much energy women expand\nModulating considering strategizing thinking tactically about how to use their voice how to suppress their voice how to channel their anger how to swallow their anger what to do in order to be rhetorically effective\nOut of time and energy women spend doing this kind of maneuvering around the rules around are angry expressions\nI Want to talk I Want to talk a little bit uh in the last ... section of the show that we have about where some of this anger\nGoes because this is a moment in America and let's be realistic moments have a way of fading they just do and and so I'm interested in where this goes when\nMaybe the cameras in all of the writers who aren't Rebecca Traister and Brittany Cooper are not as interested anymore you know in a in a couple of years I think that might happen and I want to know where this goes now we've been hearing from so many one listeners I Want to play you another mash up of some of the women's voices who've been reaching out to us about how they're feeling\nMy name's Erin I'm calling from Lancaster, Pennsylvania Farrah from Cincinnati when I met my anger bubble over and I get really angry out loud it\nIt really doesn't get much good I find that if I express a strong opinion or even just a bit of discomfort with something I perceived as being angry or a very acting women yelling even in this day and age are acceptable men don't have that same problem and I'm\nStarting to feel like maybe it's not just a personal issue dealing with like a nice and and uh and keep our Masha however I Am so angry and so angry right now\nMaybe women all over the place you're dealing with it I'm turning my anger into action\nIf it helps to feel like I'm not alone but\nStill pretty discouraging I think that's what when they have to deal with it take that anger hold onto it\nAnd that's how we're going to take back this country\nWe're hearing from listeners women who it feels like there's a theme or transferring\nSome of their personal rage I'm sure a lot of it's in in personal life not just political life or cultural life but into action taking action in the streets taking action maybe at the ballot box we got this tweet from Tracy in Jacksonville I'm One of the thousands of women using their frustration to run for office\nI'm running for the Florida House district Fifteen I Am focused on my determination to be a voice for all and focus on issues important to Jacksonville families Tracy is one candidate who says that this moment of anger is very important for her motivation a Brittany Cooper I Want to talk about where\nThis goes in terms of maybe the mid terms that might be the most immediate effect I'm I\nNone of us knows exactly how that vote is going to turn out but it seems like any\nPollster or political analyst worth anything is looking down and what they called across Chad and noticing a vet women are mad women are going to vote and women in Oregon\nBe I'm I'm particularly heartened by the Stacey Abrams campaign down in Georgia we have the opportunity to have the\nFirst black woman governor of a state of a former slave state on the on a Presley campaign they're all of these progressive campaigns that are being run and here's the thing we've been seeing that since twenty sixteen we had a wave of\nA progressive as sort of radically progressive black mayors in the deep south and so one of the things that I Want to challenge folks to do as we think in this moment is to actually look at what people of color are doing not just women but particularly black women in these elections the ways that we have the channeling our\nAnger um for decades and decades and that started with the way that we voted for Hillary Clinton and the most immediate political moment um but to your earlier point about whether or not our anger can be sustained\nUm I think that I think that this can be sustained I think that we have to remember that the women's movement in this country do it goes through ebbs and flows has really been a solid political project uh since uh depending on how you count Eighteen thirty one or Eighteen forty\nEight so we're we're two hundred years in a almost here and so I think you know I'm I\nThink that there is a real opportunity for us to make some change here\nAnd I think that as women see that um our power in our\nAbility to frame issues in ways that include the most American and take care of the most marginalized Americans um I I'm I'm excited about a blue wave of what I what I\nHope though is that folks start to see that even if you don't care a lot about presidential politics um ... down ballot races really matter that local races really matter\nThe one point three clocks didn't Lewiston\nTo fight

Sarah you're a proponent of a living wage and I and I read that tweet from one of our listeners who said why have a minimum wage why not index it and ... to a real life now what is the difference between a minimum wage and and what's become known as a living wage right\nWell MIT has a living wage calculator where you can go on there and type in where you live and it'll be allowed in number that's based on looking at the cost of local transportation sued housing and other basic needs\nI looked up on the city I live in the district of Columbia they said the living wage there I was Seventeen dollars an hour but that's for full time work\nAnd I want to point out that a huge ... additional problem in addition to the low wages in this country is the increase in security if work how many people are working part time at Walmart it's half\nOf their employees are part time workers and then there's the temporary workers and the subcontracted workers you know Amazon Fifteen dollars an hour is not going to apply to their\nA contractor sets the increased ... precarious nest of work that that's also a big problem eat despite are low unemployment we still have so many people working every day for poverty wages\nI'm Paul even though Fifteen dollars an hour is twice the current federal minimum as you mentioned we're it from a lot of listeners who say in this economic climate or even Fifteen doesn't go very far let's hear from some of them\nWhen all is higher than the minimum wage to try to better for workers but never catch up with a dog and a one way and runs a minimum wage that's never in there\nAnd as a college graduate with a bachelor's degree and student loans I already make Fifteen dollars an hour at a fulltime job and have to supplement with at least one part time job at all times\nThere needs to be some consideration on regional differences because I can uh\nSeen dollars an hour in California I work another job the act my full time job and uh so I Am kind of waiting by fortunately I have lots of credit card debt and the result and actually like Eighteen dollars going out at twenty four a fulltime job what probably closer to my back\n[noise] that Paul we hear from a lot of listeners there who are living on minimum wage and for many many more this has been a big issue in Congress workers who work for big companies can't afford healthcare don't have insurance wind up relying on state or federal public assistance\nTo make up the difference and that suggests that all of us in some way are subsidizing low wages\nNow you're you're exactly right and I mean you're ... ... as or your callers I mean\nActually if you look at cost of living data you see that in all fifty states\nI'm a single worker will need at least Fifteen dollars an hour to cover the basics in just a couple of years and in the high cost states the your your your listeners were flogging or workers with children will need even more than Fifteen dollars an hour we have a report on our website by my uh pinto PI MTO\nOn this with the with the numbers for all fifty states and uh\nIt really highlights how Fifteen is really a basic national floor and we need to even go up from there like a you know you know in New York and New Jersey did this week we're airport workers are getting a raise to Nineteen dollars an hour\nAnd hotel workers are are striking around the country in the higher costs that he's demanding twenty five dollars an hour or so you know your workers or your your listeners are right about about about what you know as a practical matter if we do the math what would it ... individuals need to to to get by especially in the higher cost regions\nAnd as a result you know a lot of employees of of companies big and small are relying on our taxpayer funded safety net for support you know more than a hundred and fifty billion dollars a year of safety net programs go to a workers in low paying jobs and you know these are good programs and we should have them but we need\nYou know major employers to do their part to pay a decent wage of at least Fifteen dollars an hour and then to supplement that with a with work supports in order to help bring bring workers up to a a a basic level\nNow let's hear some of the other side of the ... rights to us on Facebook when I worked for Walmart we were all excited when they raised our wages to ten dollars and fifty cents\nBut then they cut ours to barely twenty hours a week then told us if we even had to have an open schedule we would get even less I'm skeptical of individual companies that are raising weights\nJust say Fifteen dollars an hour could wind up backfiring on workers\nI'm all for making you know Fifteen dollars an hour at the job I'm at now I work at ... in the mall but I find that a lot of people are a lot of employers if they're raising the hourly wage or just cutting down hours\nWhich in the end it either arrows I'm from the previous uh wage\nOr in some cases you make let\nI'm opposed to raising it to Fifteen dollars an hour simply because I don't think businesses will take that last they will raise the prices the standard of living will race and Fifteen dollars won't get anyone any employer will stay for\nMichael Saltsman you hear the concerns there it'll raise prices on consumers they'll just pass it along or companies will simply juggle hours to make up the difference and you might get more per hour but you get less hours and you don't come out ahead\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Boehner with a bonus certified craftsmen program a

NPR\nLooking back to ... with you today\nI'm Sorry I ... I I Want to talk about a fight going on in Washington DC where we happened to be in a one eight studios at WAMC manners are welcome [laughter]\nUnfortunately increasingly so but there has been a very important wage fight going on on the local level not in Washington is a world knows it but D.C as locals know\nThere was a ballot initiative where voters in DC voted to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers a bar backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily\nAnd there was a big fight a lot of pushback it looks like grassroots resistance and then we found out that a lot of the money for the pushback was indeed coming from organizing interests for restaurant owners of the American restaurant association local chapters and others\nUm voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars\nAnd now the city council here in the district of Columbia has decided that voters were wrong and they are in the process of voting\nThis very day to overturn the will of local D.C voters on this issue or what does this fight here in D.C say about the state of wages especially for ticked workers people who might get paid by their employer I don't know five bucks an hour because they make up the rest in in ones and hopefully five mhm\n[noise] the way I see it this week the living wage movement to three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen and they had one big step back with the DC Council voting to repeal um that say well if that's all it hurts\nWorkers I'm sad really than minimum wage protects workers as two dollars and Thirteen cents it's been stuck there for a couple of decades here in DC it's three dollars and eighty nine cents\nTechnically if you don't make enough tips to bring that ah wage up to that the um the local minimum your employer is supposed to make up the difference\nThat pretty much never happens I used to work in the restaurant industry and I've talked to a lot of restaurant workers that pretty much never happens and so we have a workforce of restaurant server as primarily women many women of color\nOr at a job where people face rampant sexual harassment they're vulnerable because they're having to do whatever customers say to get those tips because without the tips they're back down to really at a lower wage that doesn't amount to anything so\nPeople in the district um voted to get rid of this two tier system\nUm the industry launched an incredible campaign against it they put posters up everywhere in the city saying save our tips to try to make people think that this had something to do with banning tips\nIt did not it was clearly be beyond a local issue this with the national showdown between the restaurant industry and people who are trying to get a fair wage for this vulnerable sector of the workforce\nMichael Saltsman what did you see at play here I think we're familiar with workers versus management in a fight like this\nUh the DC Council voting to overturn the will of the voters who is remarkable but what about the economics of it well actually so I I think in this case you had a situation where the interests of workers and management were actually very clearly aligned I mean there was a sixteen hour hearing\nBefore the council voted on this this bill to repeal the initiative initiative Seventy seven I'm I was at the hearing I testified at two thirty in the morning it wait until three twenty in the morning I'm In the number of employees who showed up to say\nThis is going to be harmful to us you need to repeal this far out numbered those where they're supportive and I just want to take a step back to I mean it was mentioned earlier that a living wage in in DC is is is Seventeen dollars an hour I mean tipped employees in D.C\nAccording to the bureau of Labor Statistics are in with their tips about Eighteen Nineteen dollars an hour or so you have people who are already doing quite well and what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came together and said okay we're we want to go to a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and regardless of what you think on the merits of that\nWe're also going to raise the kids may when I'm In wage in that case up to about five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employee\nThe New York based group called rock that didn't like that and so they they came in and they had a lot of money that come in to try and put this issue on the ballot and what happened was yes the restaurant industry um was opposed this ballot measure but you had a massive grassroots outpouring\nFrom employees hundreds of who showed up for instance to an event with council chairman Phil Mendelson to say\nWe don't want this and I think it's part of a bigger movement of employees that you say you say grass roots and I'm I'm sure that you're right but grass roots are astro turf we see so much grass roots in the area of wages and minimum wage is only to find out that the grassroots workers who are fighting against\nIncreases in wages are are backed by business center as well so actually I I think it's I think that that talking point I think that's been used by proponents is is is a little bit um demeaning to the workers who who came forward\nUm because of the the testimony they gave it you know one forty five in the morning or the people who got up\nA at Franklin hall and said you know what this is going to be harmful to me this can be harmful to my industry\nDon't try and save me I'm not asking for it I mean I think that the that the notion I think that these people are just doing that um because they're sort of put up to it or somehow but they're not real employees\nUm I I think it's kind of insulting to what they're trying to do in a film and all that chairman Phil Mendelson to chair the DC Council made an interesting point um when he got to talk about this which is a he said\nI have heard from countless employees who tell me this is not good for them I have heard from almost nobody who wants who wants to keep it and he said people can come to me privately they can email me this is not an issue of their owners being intimidated he said that the grassroots on this in support of it was silent he called them the silent grassroots and I think that's\nThat's indicative of where the passion was on this issue let's pull\nBack from the district the district of Columbia the local D.C back out to the nation at large and so many of you won a listeners\nHad been reaching out to us Nina posts on Facebook I'm In a precarious position if my wages go up I won't be eligible for Medicaid so it's a wash or worst for me we talked about free riders and how many workers who get minimum wages wind up on public assistance\nAnd Randy in Tulsa emails advocates are correct Amazon Wal Mart McDonalds and the other giants can afford Fifteen dollars for a minimum wage but the local donut shop the mom and pop florist those businesses will be hurt it's just another blow against main street\nNow Sara I Want to talk to you about income inequality and wear a minimum wage fits into this we hear so much about the growing wealth gap and massive income inequality\nMinimum wage actually provide any real equity or is it just a drop in the bucket in a world where the top one percent two percent\nIt's meaningful but in some ways it as a drop in the bucket you know a couple of years ago two of my colleagues calculated that three men three wealthiest men in America including Amazon CEO Jeff Bass though it's Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have combined wealth at is greater than the combined wealth at the bottom half of the country\nAnd today that's an understatement because just as well as increased so much but nevertheless to dramatize is just how extreme the wealth gap is and I think there's a lot of interest in\n'em adding to the fight for Fifteen efforts to look not just at the low end of the wage scale but also the top and what can we do to prevent these really obscene levels of income and wealth concentration at the top that are so damaging to our economy our democracy\nNot to mention just a moral outrage and in a country that that is so wealthy\nAnd so I'm really excited about a new tool we have for doing this this year for the first time in history publicly held companies have to report the gap between their CEO and their worker pay\nThe numbers coming out are staggering at Walmart it's a thousand to one at a McDonalds it's three thousand to one and we can build on that information\nTo incentivize companies to to narrow there gaps and just one quick example Portland, Oregon introduced the world's first tax penalty on companies that pay their CEO\nMore than one hundred times their median worker paid this year they're going to put the revenue from that into homeless services and it'll hit companies like Wells Fargo and and Wal Mart that do business in the city of Portland I think ideas like that are going to start to spread like wildfire now that we have this information about gaps within specific company\nAnd an interesting set of proposals at a time when populism is strong\nIn our political culture on the left and on the ride and workers voices and income inequality becoming a much more important part of the conversation you certainly see a lot of pushback from corporate America I think Bernie would be down Alexandria Ocasio Cortez knew your strong\nBusiness argument for this there's research that shows narrower gaps are good for business low a lower turnover rates raised worker morale so it's not just people on the left it's enlightened business leaders who should be behind these kinds of efforts no", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A
