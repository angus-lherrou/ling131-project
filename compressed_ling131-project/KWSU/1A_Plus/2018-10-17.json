U. dot org\nLet's read one more eggs or from the book this is about something that happened to you and your mother or when you were younger not real far from here in Maryland and it is on page eighty one would you mind reading from it's about halfway down PGD one of the part that begins when we were half a mile from home\nTo almost the end of page eighty three which ends with the word flying would you read that for us please\nSure [noise] anyway [noise] officer while we were [laughter] when we were half a mile from home a Maryland police cars stopped to just like when they stopped us in Mississippi you set up in your seat ... kept both hands on women look straight ahead\nAnd to my public enemy T shirt he told me to sit up keep my hands on the dashboard don't say a word officer knelt down and lifting your window\nWhen I saw your face so close to his gun I Want it to snatch it and watch it melt into black grits evidence police started approaching me more often and Mississippi I wanted to super power to melt every gun in the world and the black grits\nOfficer asked why we had in Mississippi license plates because we are residents of Jackson, Mississippi you say\nI have a post doctoral appointment at the University of Maryland College park\nHave I done anything wrong officer when officer told you to speak up and claim your change lanes without signaling you kept your grip on the steering wheel and said I did not change lanes without signaling you spit up behind me so I said no and changed lanes officer tried to laugh and you're faced at the asked for your license and registration\nIs that your man he asked you he needs to show some identification to your hands came up staring well and you pointed out the officers face move away from my car you said that as much how he is Fifteen Years old he does not have identification I mean I have your badge number please\nI hated how it sounded when you didn't use contraction\nGolf to ask both of us to step out of the car we will not get out of his car you said a lot of this time we have done nothing wrong my fist were bald up and I was edging towards the driver's side window he slapped me across my chest with the back of your hand and told me to be quiet and unclean my fist right as another officer pulled up\nThe first officer who's now laughing walked back to the second officers car\nYou eventually showed the second officer you license and your University of Maryland id officer looked at the id flipped it over and told us to have a good night never give them a chance to take a shot you finally said\nAfter we walked in the apartment and lock the door they will take it they will take it they will take it\nI Wonder why you said it three times and why you never told me to shoot back\nMississippi Marilyn it doesn't matter where the where you are they will shoot Joe Black but out of the sky every chance they get if you have a heart attack dodging bullets they hide their guns and say you killed yourself I hear you I told you and try to make you laugh\nWhy didn't you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't and they instead of their though if I did not know correct English it more likely that officer might have shot a few states\nYou looked at me like you were thinking you might actually be right key but in the long run correct English will save a black man more than it will hurt you will correct English save you do I do not need saving you said I'm not the one who was an endangered species I'm not either I told you\nI Am an endangered species with a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back that cop gave me the bubble you laughed and laughed and laughed until you didn't while I was in my room change and you told me to write about what I learned from the experience with the police\nI wasn't sure what to write because I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky\nIt seem like just driving or walking into a house or doing your job or cut it in a grapefruit was all it took to get shot out of the sky\nAnd the biggest problem was police weren't the only people doing the shooting they were just the only people allowed to walk around and threaten us with guns in prison if they didn't like our style of flying I loved our style of flying\nOther eggs or for heavy psyche is they leave and there is a lot going on to the eggs are but I think one of the census from the last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it\nYeah I mean that's the crux of a lot of uh\nThe relationship or talk about in his book with my mother um I'm also talking about a situation where we went to had to go to a new school an eighth grade was first time I've gone to school with white kids\nAnd a few my best friends from a previous school were there and one of my best best friends um took out a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way you did every morning when we were at a other school and Jackson and long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told and put a knife away treated the knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers grandmothers\nAnd in that situation I learned that sometimes in off in a mock communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so ah my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying the Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what you're not giving them a chance to look like eat in a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out to the library without checking it out\nYou can dodge them if you just anticipate every move and again anticipation is crucial but what happens to the home life when you spend your entire life outside at home anticipating white supremacy and white power do when you when that's the question I'm trying to ask an infection and also in the entire book what\nDid happen with your home life particularly with with you and your mom as you were trying to grapple with these things that she was telling you or the way of the world and you were trying to understand and how did that affect your relationship with her\nYou know when one way I think a lot of just traditionally American things happen I started to be resentful that my mother was telling me things some things that were raised some things that were wrong um she started to be a ... a lot more active\nIn trying to police to me as my body group um and I started to have lots and lots of run ins with cops are starting to get kicked out of school more [noise]\nUm and we could talk about those things sorted we could talk about police but to talk about white people but we we couldn't talk about with things like sexual violence so we couldn't talk about with like domestic abuse she was in an abusive relationship I saw that relationship I reacted to that relationship I tried to fight and protect different relationship but I Would never talk to her\nAbout that fight in our protection she saw me and relationships that were like difficult for me where I was being bad to myself where I was mistreating people emotionally we didn't know how to talk about any of it so while we're doing really good sort of at talking about how we survive outside of the house\nThe particular kinds of violence as they were happening in my house were completely silent we never knew how to talk about it and so you know it took me until I was forty two forty one years old to have the guts to actually write into some of what was happening in our house and try to connect that to what was happening outside of our house\nI Want to talk more about your literary style but I did want to point out one other aspect of the antics don't you just read\nWhere the officer looked at you and said who is that is that your man there's also this through line about people presuming that black boys are older than they are a was a factor in the shooting of to me or rice the young man who was shot dead in Cleveland, Ohio back in November of twenty four team\nTwenty three

A. M. U. dot board we heard from quite a few of you who shared your stories about exploring your tribal ancestry about what that means to you in the context of your life here's one voice mail that was left in our inbox\nHi Sheila this is Carol elaborately I found out about oh four or five years ago that we had a lot of documentation from my mother to us that we were part of the ... tribe in Oklahoma we\nApplied to be a member of the ... tribe we were accepted and it's been a real joy to be a member 'cause we um we can vote now we get all kinds of information from them what they're doing with the tried just amazing\nCarol thanks very much for getting in touch with us more ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but broadly speaking what what is it takes\n... usually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections and Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back I'm a three time\nOr one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community as one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long art and being part of that is I think really important what was the things I Love to think about is shown is once hunted bastard on\nPunted mastodon\nHunted best that I think about that long arc\nYeah yeah I it's I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing\nThat you're part of a community that goes back millennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture are there other kinds of benefits that you find whether their intrinsic or extra benefits of being an acknowledged member of a tribe that are worth\nProtecting that are worth keeping in their proper places I mean Carol talked about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what are the kind of benefits are there to being an acknowledge citizen of a truck\n[noise] well I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it isn't coming upon us to protect our ... our our children are native languages\nWant to know if they're native [noise] you know they they the problem is some of them take our culture and they can modify it they take our language and they can modify it they take our spirituality and modify it and they make money\nThey make money off as something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of their family lore or they speak with them mugging entitlement like they've lived the life of a native like somebody who's ever called them an engine or\nA our word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies at the door to even if it's Elizabeth Warren\nI should know by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today that we did a discussion about these DNA testing kids the ones that say find Dr ancestry and learn what your family's from we did a program today's October Seventeen so we did it on October Eighteenth\nOf last year called ... where do we come from where we spoke to a geneticist\nNamed Adam Rutherford who's gone into some of the latest research about what DNA can and cannot tell us about ourselves and what you actually need to know if you were going to do one of these home DNA tests\nYou'll find that conversation with Adam referred on our website the one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org\nBrittany tweeted I Am a county and kick Hanukkah or mohawk and I'm frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help native issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nYou a progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focus on this\nYou would progressive she must have known why we both Kerry living 'cause we were going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what progress has brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nWell North Dakota has\nA voter identification law that has been stayed by the court in town now last week the Supreme Court at decided to essentially and let it go into effect for the November election\nSo what that means his new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election as you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp ... one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us wrapped Kevin\nThe high camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters she had a very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American and so this voter id law\nCould potentially saw heavily upon Native Americans courts had stayed at because they said that that north Native Americans in North Dakota we're less likely to have the types of ID that were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea and the first place\nAnd what kinds of ID are we talking about like what is the law requires\nThe central issue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have that they have PO box as they have mailing address it and those addresses are no longer sufficient so if you have ID but it carries a\nMailing address a post office box you can no longer you to vote in North Dakota and the selection you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that I Do you use in the primary is no longer good for the general election\nA lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by their supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has that been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been\nUm talked about as a measure to prevent voter fraud and also because the the state has argued that a mailing address doesn't necessarily locate a voter in the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot someone could use a mailing address and and even added vertically\nVote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a voter die Lucian argument that inappropriately cast valid and the wrong precinct would would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if you're a mailing address a somewhat different than where you actually reside\nWould love to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affects you particularly if you are part of a tribal population there reservation maybe you live in an area where folks predominantly have fuel boxes as their primary mailing address rather than a physical street residential address what are you seeing and how is this\nAffecting you whether you're in North Dakota or elsewhere love to hear from you if you are in North Dakota but email is one a X. W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one a or comment on our Facebook page\nCary what did you hear from people in North Dakota about how this law as affecting them if it's on people's radar is is kind of more of a a a smaller issue\nI'd say it is and also you have to put all against alerts\nAnd I also think there's some context around it when I was reporting from North Dakota from the Standing Rock reservation which is in North and South Dakota but the north Dakota part is affected by this\nI'm a you know it's really one of the things that I was interested in one of the reasons I went there even before the Supreme Court ruling is because of voter turnout there is the lowest in the state\n... it was the lowest in the state before this and that's because there are challenges that people their face and getting to the polls so I I think you have this law now\nBecoming a new complication for this election that has the potential to drive turnout even lower and you have people reacting to that their their excuse me their tribal governments and nonprofits that are taking steps to try and help people get residential address as if they need them assigned trying to make sure that they can obtain id\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Subaru featuring the all new three row was sent with feeding for up to eight and a choice of second row captain's chairs love and so it makes us Subaru Subaru learn more it Subaru dot com\nFrom Sedona the investments taking a personalized approach to helping clients grow preserve and manage their wealth learn more finality dot coms flash wealth fidelity brokerage services ... and from Americans for the arts\nTomorrow we'll continue our conversation about the mid term elections with the national look at major races and issues we booked a great panel but we could use your help to focus the discussion\nWhat are your main questions and your main concerns about the midterms candidates polls voter turnout controversies or anything else\nLeave us a voicemail eight five five to three six one a one day what should we talk about tomorrow when we talk about the midterms on a national level it's eight five five to three six one two one two\nYou can also send us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop you can download the app that's V.

I I have no context for dealing with tribal populations in politics and you said there is quite an array of diversity among the tribes that would that you would be representing\nIn Congress can you give folks just a sense of what it's like to try to represent the issues of all those different groups do you find that there is a handful of issues the kind of overlap every one or do you really have to be sensitive to what\n[noise] sure I mean I think there's some of that ... ... absolutely there's there you know they'll they'll be some competing issues along the way but but really I'm land water or our environment is all I mean that's sort of a\n... those are issues that transcend um you know tribal lines so to speak to issues that that all of us are concerned about and so um so I I'm I'm a lifelong environmentalist and you know I I'm a I'm somebody who used to go down to the to\nThe field with my grandfather and weeds and pick worms off of corn um so I Know I understand the value of clean water and clean land to our people and I think that is that's an issue that transcends a lot of tribes across the country um\nBut you know the issues you were talking about earlier with voting that that is that's definitely an issue that all of us care about as well because we deserve a to have a voice at the table that's something I've been fighting for for a long time I've I've been getting out the\nVote in Indian communities for nearly Twenty years because I've always felt that we should have a say in who are elected officials are so\nUm so that's a passion of mine as well and and I want to work to make sure that that our voices are always heard in that respect\nI don't want to keep you too much longer but I Do wonder what you make of this larger surge of Native American candidates this year the ... what do you think is behind that\nWell of course I mean it's a you know it's hard to say exactly but I mean there we can because we've had you know we've had a advocates and and\nYou know we've had protest for centuries there I mean we we've always been on the ground are fighting for I'm\nFighting for something that we feel we deserve and and that's been true whether it's fishing rights water rights land rights um those have always you know been hallmarks of our of of protests throughout\nThroughout our country's history for Native Americans um this time around gosh it could be a number of things that could be the uh Standing Rock a movement for the no doubt apple", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Pullman", "day": "17"}
