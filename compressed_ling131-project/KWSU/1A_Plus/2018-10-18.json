Bo of applied economic research here in New Hampshire we'd love to hear from you to share what you know about finding a job in today's economy comments on our Facebook page where you can watch video stream courtesy of New Hampshire public radio\nTweet us at one a or email one at a at W. A. M. U. dot org before we keep going and introduce\nOur next guests I just want to kind of add a yes any men to what the deal you just said there is no shame and getting a career that doesn't require a college degree not\nAnd we did a show last year called how to earn six figures without a four year degree about how to get into some of the skilled trades\nThat requires some training or an apprenticeship but that don't require a four year bachelor's degree one of our guests are Nicholas when Louis Wyman who is the c._e._o. of the Institute\nFor workplace skills and innovation wrote a book called the job you and he put a question and answer on our website about what an apprenticeship is how does an apprenticeship work when should you consider taking one where do you go to find one you'll find all this information on our site a program called how to earn six figures with\nOne the letter a dot org before we bring in our next two guests Russ one more thing about the job market here you mentioned\nThat New Hampshire has an aging population affordable housing is a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job market is adjust\nAnd aging job market or does it manifest in other ways in that well I think the main thing that it that we see right now is sort of they're lagging wage growth in the state that has is kind of a deterrent to\nBringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year as sort of lagging this prosperous economy that we hear so much about\nI think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs just to get by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn kind of reversed course and start becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that their analyze the crunch glad to get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management have been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted a zillion jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what ... my education and pay a third of what is manageable\nBut try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso here with this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome thank you Brian can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture is\nWe've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level sure what I think that it's important to\nAt the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity I start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands wage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places\nAt the Hamilton Project we've released a paper recently that describes how over the last forty years geographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places [noise]\nWe asked members of our one a text club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at aged Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now is being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nSo I actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I liked that kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nI think the same logic applies to the labor market fit in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity international data or that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages as employers compete for workers\nAnd we just haven't observe that you know overall ... wage growth after we adjust for inflation remains very weak and there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups outpacing other industries by big margins for example of wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy\nAnd I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions going a bit faster in New England in the Pacific states but\nAh but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that's all to say that they were not seeing this with the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of the U.S labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page as someone who works for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can say wages in the field aren't enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work was shell emailed it it's\nNew Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised veers we're at the national minimum wage thousands travel to Massachusetts daily where the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you're dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor into structurally\n[noise] well I and I don't have any empirical data on why so many uh employees are working in math and traveling there that I Know when I Lived there that they poured over half a million or can eaters everyday into the city and out um and\nThen many of those coming from New Hampshire so you know wages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we have entered the jobs that are out there\nWhen he sees the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\nHave [noise] you know I feel like you know my point of view is I'm going to sort of a wider industry perspective in in a sense that it worked in technology for the last ten years and\nComing to New Hampshire and looking at each of these high end um occupation such as automotive construction manufacturing there just seems to be shortages across every single single sector whether it's in India factoring or in high tech\nLet's get through a few more of your comments particularly about the nature of what we've described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed\nTo all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we're not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a huge salary\nJan in Manchester New Hampshire emailed I Know several educated unqualified older women who lost their jobs here in Manchester you've been out of work for at least six months I've overheard conversations in my local local supermarket from older employees losing hours to sixteen year olds ages them is a big problem\n... how do you see this to the impact of\nOf older workers especially in in high tech careers especially in like Silicon Valley\nIt's becoming worrisome at this point where if you're old we just decided we don't want you\nSilicon Valley for example because if you don't hire and retain older workers are chances are you're not going to get any workers because our our states\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this

O T powering enterprise digital transformation with artificial intelligence predictive analytics Sendai O T solutions learned more it see three\nW T grant foundation dot org\nBack now to our conversation was ... and Ryan ... let me get to a few more of your comments before we bring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers Chris writes\nAs a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and foreign manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS manufacturing in the U.S has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties\nThey want experienced people at relatively low wages right off the street if you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left a voice mail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics and warehouse and supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months\nAnd we are really struggling with two items one is employed turnover where there are chasing higher wages and a new facility is a new employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent is definitely impacting\nAnd warehousing\nIt's easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us\nAnother one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism\nBut transitioned into a trade job shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in I Will withhold my thoughts on your abandoning your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because the stem their brain drain some cities and counties and states are offering to pay workers to move there there's a city in Nebraska that'll match signing bonuses for newcomers\nTo the tune of five thousand dollars Vermont passed a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAn accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt that plan with the idea of Randy ...\nTo discuss it Randy welcome to weigh things Joshua so this is called the come home award tell us what to come home award is how does that work\nHe had to come home award program that we launched in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship business models on their head\nUm there are too many flaws and traditional scholarships of talk about and doing that but\nAt its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model\nAnd instead of investing heavily in Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we've flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly upon completion of some kind of degree but only if you return to our region to live and work\nAnd it's really on home reward paying off of that\nSo this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair counting\nYeah we have a very strong preference for those with family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that they have some family connection here that there's probably a better bet they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county pay me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of Lake Huron on the St Clair river um our largest town of port Huron has a population of about thirty thousand people\nWe do not have a four year University in our region we did I have a fortune five hundred company in our region a thirty percent of our workforce leaves are counting heads down and metro Detroit to to be employed but they love the small town life or the family friendly environment amenities are were small town America Josh\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside Detroit is that right\nYeah and you were talking about something earlier Josh I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is great for Detroit\nUm but the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged on the economic health of regions like port Huron are Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true how\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people here they're pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it hit here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come on program\nWas once we really hit rock bottom our state colder weather was philanthropies government business any other sector we realize that we all had to get together and play a piece in economic growth\nWaiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan it had to be an organic planned that drove our prosperity\nWe're

O. B. p.s wanna summers and Katie Sanders of politifact we love to hear from you if there's a particular race or an election that's coming up where you live in the midterms which are watching\nTerms overall nationally right now now is a good time to share those comments on our Facebook page where you can also watch video stream of today's program tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot for them and I wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked\nCasey Kendra tweeted what I Would like to see is all of the Democrats and Republicans voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization\nOf today's politics has just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but it is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people off\nYou know a lot of people might be in our frustrated with politics and the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of\nIt not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact that people strapping on the T shirt and going as hard as they can\nI Do in their political corners I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activist they're usually about the hardest core a people within the party but in fact\nWe're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains a turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for a mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by all of this high interest we're seeing high turnout in primary than in special elections\nAnd you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a Pew sixty percent of people say the president in a factor in their vote and that is higher than it's ever been\nA wonder wanna summers what your take is on that in terms of the potential playbook for Democrats first of all let's just said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats with the Democrats need to flip the house\nChurch that Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public polling when we look across the landscape suggest that they're doing they're making good effort and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to you\nMake sure that their voter turnout and particularly looking appetite boaters infrequent voters who say may show up and a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home and I'm an off year or mid term here and there is a reason for that\nTypically when we look at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republican tell things that you see Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennial voters of color or Latino African Americans and Asians who are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and ...\nIs there a certain benchmark water for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word a blowout slide you use the goal just to get a fifty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch goal but the Democratic party is aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan a congressman who chairs the Democratic democratic congressional campaign committee is\nThey don't think that there's going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house of turning the house to play but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue wave crashing over I pick up some tendency if there had been like that\nThey're focusing on delivering that twenty three at turning the house bill and the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that as a a balance of power right now Republicans\nControl every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou have this idea of a blue wave was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible foreign interference we're about to be pumped again\nDominican let me ask you about some of the polling what are some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do\nWell when we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist polling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballad who would you prefer to be\nA two run Congress down the Democrat in your district or the Republican the ... in your district you know we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now\nOr other polling other public following a shown it to be double digits that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take at least that was twenty three seats in the house\nAnd I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field when I gamed out or how many seats would be up for grabs this year I found that there are ... seats that were uh\nIn battle enthusiasm Republicans and it certainly did only six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter what you look at that\nAnd you know if the Democrats win half of those that's the house\n[laughter] glad to hear from some of you with regards to your concerns about the midterms including about the nature of polling in general identical I Love you to respond to this comment from a listener who left a note in our inbox\nI'm Alan from Ashville North Carolina and I'm frustrated with the electrons with not having enough holes in down ballot races even even U.S House by state house and stuff because if it's a close election I Want to vote Democrat\nAt least at the federal and state level but if it's a good weekend that I Want to vote a third party greener libertarian\nOr write my own in foreign aid to know it raises a host or not if it's a if it's true it if my vote might be the deciding vote and I need up all I Need some polls to uh to divide and it it actually changes my boat Nepal change my vote\nAlan thanks for your comment window that cracks me up or if he wants to run for office he should run for office if he wants to a vote third party because that's his conscience than he should do so\nI get a pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of you know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him who voted in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to poll look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go and drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling is lower and lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate in that that just continues to decrease\nIt takes a lot of money to conduct a good pole and to get a sizable enough sample that the results are representative and it's really tough and I would just say go based on the issues and vote your conscience\nYeah quite a lot of you express real concern with the very nature of polling Peter wrote on our Facebook page please discuss the obsession the media NPR included has with the horse race method of election coverage is an ear response\nAnd Michael wrote on our Facebook page unit which still trust polls remember how that turned out in twenty sixteen\n[noise] yeah I mean I you know look I mean this is a this is a tried and true a criticism\nUm ... you know we can get into the science of polling and whatnot and I would disagree that were obsessed a quote unquote with polling we do use it to pepper our coverage and to give us a sense of what the snap shots are within districts in fact\nI'm far more interested in trends in polls rather than poll to pull horse race I think that's a not a good way to look at the polling uh I think that uh again overall trends and you know issues and question\nOf giving you a sense of a kind of a temperature read of people is way\nMore useful I should note earlier this year back in February we did a whole hour on the nature of political polling Dominican was part of the panel you can listen to that program which we called can we trust polls\nOn our website just search for it on line at the one a dot org that's the words are the number one the letter a dot org wanna I also kind of feel like the comment we heard from Allen is exactly what many democratic

centers of politifact and NPR's political months and are all still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the mid term elections email us one a X. W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one eighty or comments on our Facebook page where you can also watch our video stream of our lovely environments here\nAt New Hampshire public radio also you can go check out some more of Iraq's when coverage at an H. P. R. dot org including of some of the things that make New Hampshire unique\nThere's a story about a giant pumpkin boat race engulfed town I didn't know pumpkins were that point but I Will after the show I Want to check it out and H. P. R. dot org let's get to some of your comments about the midterms Laurie emailed I Am a lifelong Democrat and I can tell you what frustrates me and has for years\nThe complete inability of the Dems to get a message and stick to it\nI've gone to my local Democratic Party website and the front page does not see what they are for does not tell me what they care about one of summers you've been following the Democrats in the run up to the midterms how common is Laurie complaint and how well are Democrats doing an answering it\nI think the largest pointing to is actually really comment and I think Democrats are trying to figure out how it affects that and number of the conversations I had I have recently wrote an article about looks at how Democrats are trying to make sure they have record ...\nStates and districts are trying to make sure that they're telling their vote or is that they have a message that they are running on rather than just having these conversations that are about just running against President Trump\n... um I was talking to some groups that did come field testing recently among Latino voters and they said ... and when they get this field testing\nThey were saying people were turned off is that if they got to try a mailer from their local democratic candidate had President Trump space on it they be super turned off right they started out a way they wouldn't even engage or the who the candidate was so I think they're really trying to tweak that match and you talk about what they can do for them what's at stake that that's\nThat's why you hear are Democrats nationally talking about how this is the most important election of our lifetimes why you hear that healthcare message I think has Dominican noted being such a huge share of the advertising that you're seeing from pro democratic groups as they do realize that they need a message for their voters to coalesce around otherwise they're not going to turn out\nTo medical I Wonder if we can follow up on that theme was one more voice mail from a listener on the east coast here's what John left in our inbox\nTissue John ... Syracuse New York so often on the shows people for the Republicans the Democrats or Republicans the Democrats the Republicans for instead of doing that they\nShould be focusing on specific policies namely the Democrats that stand for such and such the Republicans that stand for such and such\nIt helped educate listeners because you don't gain anything by just growing Democrats Republicans Democrats Republicans\nJohn thanks very much for calling and sharing your thoughts with us no medical for me I don't know how you do this but for me as a journalist I feel uncomfortable saying the Democrats who stand for X. I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for X or the Democrats who have done\n... to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's\nPoint that it just feels a little bit too broad brush\nYeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where are the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of the pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what\nPresident Obama did a regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example a by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy that Democrats are firmly\nDidn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans and how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the parties stand for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head in in in this mid term\nKatie I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight dot org listener writes with the upcoming midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advice to go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are the negative campaign ads coming from a particular party or group Cady\nOh I think everyone's guilty and I don't think any party has a\nHas Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and that really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do it as memorable\nAnd it's certainly a bill that impression that people are going to remember and that's why we see so much of it and that's why we have jobs here fact checkers [laughter] there's plenty to do\nYou you will never be unemployed not ever\nTheir medical research on some of the diversity of the candidates this time around quite a few record numbers of women running a record numbers of el ... out L G T two candidates running some of whom spoke to Ari Shapiro on all things considered earlier give us a sense of what that means for\nThe midterms and whether or many of these candidates are considered to stay on a strong chance of winning\nLook you're correct that there are a lot of people um who are\nA ... of diverse backgrounds I mean women are the biggest bloc of ... that are really driving the midterms you think a lot of Native American candidates a you know just the New Hampshire there Chris Pappas who is\nA an openly gay man I he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire the Democrat now but when again we look at the power of the midterms women they has been fired up since the day President Trump\nWas elected and when we talk about when and when I'm a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women\nWho have been nominated for a for Congress for their party's nomination a hundred and eighty three of those a hundred and eighty three has been democratic women just if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running a hot that would be bigger than the record previously of all women combined do or nominees and that was\nIn this in this go round a democratic women who've been nominees\nAbsolutely that's absolutely right it was a wave of democratic women the year of the woman quote unquote round to ah\nAfter Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill area have been driven by democratic women and we've seen them be very fired up in poll after poll and you know they're going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nWanted there are some races where you know women are making a very historic a historic showing I mean the Arizona Senate races going on right now between ... and send them at the Democrat and more with Sally the Republican you know Arizona is going to have a female senator in that seat I Wonder how much\nYou see this as a bipartisan trend we heard the numbers from Dominican oh but do we get the sense\nThat both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nShirt so I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates is certainly more on the side of the Democrats and Republicans I think that's frustrated\nAnd number of Republican women I spoke to two women who founded the group Republican went on for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate young promising Republican conservative went in\nFrom the local the local level seats all the way up so nothing that really reflects say what you see on the left on the Democratic side from emily's list a group that cultivate and backs\nA pro abortion rights when female candidates so there there's some concern certainly among Republicans and my colleagues at age ... he actually asked\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell about that the question came in the back and forth about the Senate Judiciary committee and the lack of Republican women on that panel during the hearings around Dr ... Ford and justice ... now justice Brett Kavanaugh and he's on them or relate and why there were no women there Mitch McConnell said you know\nThat's something he doesn't like it's something he wants to see more up but I still haven't heard Republican\nForthrightly at least to me answer if this is such a problem if you want to see more women in the Senate on your side if you want to see more women moving up in the house and we should note that there is a woman and Republican leadership and Kathleen Morris Rogers but where did as women come from because\nAs we know running for office is very expensive at the very top it's very tactical if you don't have help and you don't have an apparatus those people are never going to show up\nSpeaking of women Republican leadership to medical I I'm not sure if you've seen anybody running or campaigning talking about Senator Susan Collins of Maine and her decision to allow the Brits", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Pullman", "day": "18"}
