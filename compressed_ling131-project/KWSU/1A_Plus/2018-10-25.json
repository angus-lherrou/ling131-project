of his tax returns um are found um released on Rachel Maddow show\nAnd they showed that he made a hundred and fifty million dollars\nThat year this was for two thousand five and this thing started

stoking political divisions this morning the president tweeted quote\nA very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposefully false an inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news and it's gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must to clean up its act\nFast unquote\nThis story is moving very fast and again there's still a lot that we do not know including who is behind the suspicious device and then what message they exactly we're trying to send will keep that keep you up to speed as quickly as we can get more details of course on your NPR member station and on\nHigher and the true nature of President Trump's wealth with Susan Craig and must beating her up in New York Times we welcome more of your questions about this investigation\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nFactor that common with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have paid in taxes\nBut didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two\nI mean it it it comes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS put push back\nOn some of the um the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various toxic authorities that weren't\nSusanna one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do with valuations I mean when French Trump's children took over his empire they valued at at a little over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had in the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nWhen they sold the business ... business is off over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more than devaluation can you give us a sense Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worse factors into all of this\nValuations became a a steam quit quickly in the\nIn our reporting once we got into the documents and we saw um sort of writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seems\nRidiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a valuations of you know five ten million\nBut on the same hand when they had a charitable donation um where they were a pie valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go higher they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nOf course if you inaccurately said the value of something to the IRS and that compromise is the amount of tax at the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond to a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the very\nBeen asking whether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce run on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich\nAfter the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone rich is engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer [laughter] those are those are very good\nQuestions I there are some of these some of the things that we're talking about here that we uncovered\nAre um trust arrangements that the IRS indoors sometimes after being pushed\nBy a trust in a state attorneys I'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them this Granta retained annuity trust which is a formal name for the mechanisms through which Donald Trump and his siblings took\nOwnership of their fathers empire in the nineties there's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on the family winery through one of these trust 'em so there there are quite common\nThen there are other aspects of of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose of an pad invoices so Donald Trump and his siblings could start\nA kicking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kinda things aren't a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we're talking about here and even in the cases where\nThey use a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people to Trump's really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in a state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers\nBefore we get into more of the details I'd like to get one more comment that was sent to in a through voice mail from one of our listeners who is struggling with the idea that the trumps actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nJeff from saint Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people have received benefits for their father I see this is an odd story\nThe second part is taxes avoided that is illegal method of reducing your tax bill through existing a statute taxes evaded now that would be interesting but so far all I hear is\nThat he use certain ... to avoid paying taxes as we all do we all\n\nAt the top I mean these aren't standard deduction one one of the um one of the things that we wrote about the rust she mentioned um was a company that was set up it's it's interesting because it's true that the rich due to a lot of things to avoid taxes the trumps cross the line into illegality and one of the companies\nThat we wrote about 'em is company called all county building supply\nIt was set up in Nineteen Ninety to its sole purpose was to to fraud the ... the IRS to avoid taxes what it was it was a fairly simple mechanism and explain it and and I think reader or your listeners can kind of come to their ... to a conclusion on it\nFor a Trump in in the early Nineteen nineties was getting old he had a ton of buildings he had a lot of cash\n'em and the Trump siblings were looking at a situation if Trump died where they would have to pay at the time it would have been a fifty five percent of state tax on all the cash that his buildings were sitting on we're talking\nTens and tens of millions of dollars so what they did was for years Fred Trump he would go out and he would buy supplies for his buildings you know we're talking boilers pay every new boilers paint supplies fridge is does all those sort of things\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and

Suzanne Craig and ... of the New York times four times to get in a few more of your questions and comments won a X. W. A. M. U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this is\nTheir job to catch the Fred trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how did they reflect on this it\nIt is their job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout\nThe story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS does um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff\nDoes get through 'em and uh I think that that sort of became a parent's house as we were sort of looking at the totality of the er the toxin out against\nThat we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS did push back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts but we did um you understand when when the IRS does see something I'm their stock and force I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were where were problems are found and eventually they come to a settlement\nAnd we we saw that additional toxins certain things was paid when they saw valuations\nThat they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled in and and things to move on and the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS I'm I owe county as the company where they had they were ... voices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire an in cases like that we saw no evidence that they were aware of what the trumps we're doing there so it's sort of a ... a mix of they caught some stuff and and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you're a port has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late are are there statute of limitations\nAre involved there are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges those have since told there is if there's fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS\nWe wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run very silent and most people who work at the IRS or for that\nTaxation authorities say based on uh the the reporting that we did they have open investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supply and maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne ...\nUm it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been fifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings I'm would've had to pay some tax that would have been a business tax\nUm and it would have been substantially less than it's interesting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he had incurred throughout his um his life that he may be potentially would have been able to shelter the anchorman not paid taxes on it because in America when you have\nYou know law says you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them pay but it would have been substantially less than fifty five percent state tax if they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of this the kind of stands out in is how\nFred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips and one of Donald Trump's fails casinos ... can you explain that to us\n... that was a and in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in its darkest moment he was facing a payment on a bond basically a a money he owns the hotel lenders\nAnd he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos his father is a lawyer showed up with checks totaling three and a half million dollars\nBought some gambling chips took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and and never cash them so that was a venture determined to be an illegal loan that Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make the payment get over that hump\nWonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if a specialist in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's ran down to pull for civil law on the trumps and make an example of them how much could they have really done I mean what what's the worst case\nWell a big one is they would have to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area with all county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are\nThat they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs\nOnto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they inflated they ... they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it\nThat potentially you could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas are not\nSo there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um they're they're facing potential not only back taxes but penalties in interest on the money that sold so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities 'em and other authorities could be looking at um\nWhere this could they have ended up in in federal prison for this\n... federal or state prison it depends on who would choose to prosecute the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing this all county they were filing false documents or with the state agency um and there would be slower level charges that would flow to that\nAnd yet those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners some if you feel that this is not as big a story of some of our other listeners field is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought\nAnd freedom and Jay tweeted so you're proved that Donald Trump successor did start with a loan from his father as she stated where exactly is the discrepancy\nNone Sudan\nComments I think one one thing that when when we started out Donald Trump parents has stated that he started with a million dollar loan and he built into a billion dollar empire he's now in the White House\nAnd he ran a campaign based on being sort of a self made\nBillionaire um there's no evidence necessarily that he is a billionaire but what we showed is that he inherited hundreds of millions of dollars over his lifetime from his father um and some of that was done through tax fraud people may or may not care about that but I think it's an important\nUm narrative of of somebody now in the White House about how he got his fortune in where the money came from it doesn't necessarily on say he didn't get revenue\nMore of that came from his father um over his lifetime and that he was willing to cross the line um to shelter from having to pay taxes I think that's an important chapter in the president's life that you know people can digest it the way they want it but it's it's important that leads to us that those stocks and and not truth is out there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Pullman", "day": "25"}
