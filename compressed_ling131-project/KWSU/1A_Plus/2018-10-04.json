Bush Gore and the recount in Florida and the ...\nWas that such a pivotal moment for political ideology America yeah no I mean I I think it's the two thousand election to me which is you know as close to a perfect I think we're ever going to see in a presidential election\nUm it was the perfect combination of the nineties all of the political wars of Nineteen nineties Bill Clinton Newt Gingrich Hillary care Ross Perot pitchforks Pat Buchanan impeachment all of these these major battle of these major forces\nThat shape politics created this division that when you looked at that map on election night two thousand and you saw the entire south was now painted red red for Republicans the entire northeast\nMinus New Hampshire barely a was painted blue for Democrats the Pacific coast you could see these\nThese stark geographic boundaries and they were more than geographic they were they were cultural boundaries they were demographic boundaries and I think the nineties really to me it's the decades those colors sync up with the parties those colors took on a bipartisan meeting political meaning and people chose sides\nAnd it's almost ... two tribes were formed red and blue and and I think that framework that was created that night that was produced by the nineties is basically the framework we have been living with ... percent and at that time red and blue working let's face it convenient network news a sort of map ways to follow okay\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Boehner with a bonus certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractor is committed to expertise and the customer service\nContractor locate her and more information or Boehner dot com\nAnd from Brown University school of professional studies with executive master's degrees for mid career professionals in the fields of business cyber security health care and science and technology leadership brown dot edu slash NPR\nThis is one eight on Todd's will like I'm Talking to MSNBC and NBC News national correspondent Steve ... about his new book the red and blue the Nineteen nineties and the birth of political tribalism\nWell here is one well remembered moment from the nineties I take you back to president almost president at this point Bill Clinton\nYou answer that question is I've never broken St Louis and when I was in England I experimented with a woman who didn't like it in and they'll never tried it again\nBill Clinton in the run up to the presidential elections in Nineteen Ninety two a deceased late Christopher Hitchens went to Oxford with Bill Clinton said the idea that Bill Clinton didn't inhale at Oxford was probably true because he knew firsthand\nDid Bill Clinton chose to take his marijuana in edible foreign ... Hitchens used to say he was no friend Bill Clinton by the way we should stipulate that\nUh but Bill Clinton's answer was lampooned at the time it's still remember now twenty six years later what political moments do you remember from the Nineteen nineties we want to hear from you what did they tell us about our politics today you can comment on our Facebook page you can tweet us ... when a you can email us one a at W. A. M.\nNineteen nineties the Vietnam Conflict was one of the most visited issues since the civil war and we still had never recovered\nAnd not witty tweets us on Twitter I was in high school when Gingrich and company produced their contract with America I remember peers who had been pleasant with each other suddenly became antagonistic suddenly politics became a team sport that experience is one of the reasons why I today\nAnd nonpartisan up Steve you're nodding and I think that type of reaction to sorting\nMight sound familiar to you I Want to go back to the history and just a moment but before we do I want to get to a moment in tribalism in politics where we are right now I Want to talk about Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham back during the impeachment was a member of the house he was an impeachment manager\nHe helped impeach Bill Clinton and then went before the Senate to make the case as a prosecutor\nThat Bill Clinton should be removed from office because of the Monica Lewinsky\nExperience I'm now Lindsey Graham is also made himself highly visible these last several weeks during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended Kavanaugh he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody saw it I'm a single white male people want me to shut up\nAnd I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve hears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner and twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nYou're forty six years you've been the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party here the speaker that the Republican controlled house you're smart you know the budget that we're in for you know they get temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon\nYou are dead men walking as far as [noise]\nNow backing twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quipped to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough\nTo survive as a Republican Party in the future meeting Republicans at your broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics\nFlash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it anymore stunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham hocus vacation in the Trump beer it said to you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean I think\nSo and the two thousand election they say that we've lived with a sense\nThey're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there in twenty twelve after twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally looked at the Mitt Romney's last a block Obama included what Lindsey Graham did it demographically\nThe way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term they came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just the one the general election and that's a huge part of it but the fact that he was able to sweep through the Republican Party's like other primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen told Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixty one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there\nOf going head to head against Trump of dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with their voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand granted or than granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of his party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator from one more term or is he is he converted what's he thank you I mean look there's and there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know but I'll give you a couple of them that that that that jumped out at me one is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his enduring popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons\nTo Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk if you are seen as separating yourself from this president your next primary especially if you're Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being a being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there is also the theory that hey part of this is\nLindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you're if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises uh if you change your tone on Trump the way he added the golf with him maybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other one\nSuicide for the Republican Party to go down this road and then seeing down from when the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think ... Lindsey Graham and just ... more broadly tells Republicans\nThat this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically Kennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacture them fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if\nWhen he closed his eyes at night whether he's changed his mind about that or not\nJames sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties\nVery tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and Steve you're nodding because that does not sound surprising to you yeah ... what he's describing his ticket splitting at them and political science they voters who go and they have a Democratic president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot\nJust election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and in that that is just the rise of polarization the tribal isn't All right let's get back in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve ... so much of what your book is about\nUh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are I'm led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have\nA when he was a young rabble rousing congressmen\nWho was willing to defy the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house to then time speaker from Massachusetts the legendary Tip O'Neill\nMy partner's maker as you pointed out to us again yesterday are in charge of the house\nIf you are saying to me the euro postmaster isn't capable of delivering from one member to another the male and the system you run\nThen I think you may want to appoint a commission to look into the post office\nNow maybe of veiled insult there that might take a little bit of parsing but give it back story and why Newt Gingrich was slinging an insult at uh the well respected and legendary Tip O'Neill yeah that that in in hindsight now you look back Thirty years and you play you may say well what was the big deal to deal with Democrats had run the Congress at that point for Thirty years\nThey were seen as the permanent majority I mean Republicans weren't just the minority party they were buried deep they weren't even close\nYou know that that was how deep in the minority they were in here with Gingrich um who was in his third term from Georgia\nLess on fundraising things for your support\n\nSupport for NPR comes from base station and from Rhodes Scholar a not for profit offering learning adventurous for adults and natural settings across the country learn more at R.

when a Todd's with like with you today we'd been keeping an eye on demands on Capitol\nHill today I have a quick update for you\nThe top Republican on the Senate Judiciary committee says the FBI has turned up nothing to corroborate allegations that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was involved in sexual assault in high school and another instance of sexual misconduct in college there is nothing in it that we didn't already know said Senator Chuck Grassley adding\nThere's also no contemporaneous evidence this investigation found no hint of misconduct and the same is true of the six prior FBI background investigations conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service that was Chuck Grassley chairman of the Judiciary Committee I was quoting their\nRanking member on the Senate Judiciary committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California disagrees she says it looks to be the product of an incomplete investigation\nThat was limited perhaps by the White House Dianne Feinstein ranking member expect much more on this throughout the day on your NPR station\nI Want to turn back to Steve ... in just a moment but before we do a quick appeal for some help with the program in the worst for next week here on one day we spend a lotta time yesterday talking with women about how society views angry women and there's a broad range of opinion but most of the women were hearing from our progressives and liberals\nIf you're a conservative woman tell us how your seeing this moment what have you got to say how do you want to be heard in the fight\nOver Brett Kavanaugh and in the fight over me to the discussions over me to in this country do you think your views are being represented or respected leaves the voicemail eight five five to three six one a one

talking for the most part about what politician said and did in the Nineteen Ninety so how do they define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington that's polarized we've been asking listeners\nFor memorable moments from politics in the nineties and and here's one\nAnd the president is right [noise] in many ways we are a shining\nSplendor and glory\nThere is this fair Mr President\nAnd the faces that you don't then the places that you don't visit [noise]\nYou're shining\nAnd believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from oh gosh the early nineties I take you back towards any overhaul\n[noise]\nSoon\nTo be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety to harm the Arsenio Hall she'll remember him Arsenio Hall before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because of the president appeared on our city hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark very serious and and a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun and the guy you want at the party\nIt was also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall show Bill Clinton was actually running not in first or second but in third place in the presidential race at that point personally sort of Ross Perot [laughter] taking place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton and so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Jennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of\nSlick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer Li try this scheme is way out of\nA out of everything and so they were trying his campaign was\nTo to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around interviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers and the draft and all that so\nHere was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall which was very hot at that moment you showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd it was Ninety two it wasn't just arson you Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that meeting\nTire Perot phenomenon began in February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King Laurie gangs and and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls and Ross Perot was out in February Ninety two and he said\nYou know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent\nIn just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteers submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nClinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show 'em in in George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show that night well\nWe won't be doing anything like that\nAnd Arsenio Hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that went went after it was beneath the presidency yeah it was neat the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not\nThat's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign to Bush wasn't do in our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message\nUm politicians now manage media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality Brock Obama had a winning personality an affable nice guy and used it\nTo great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon to Stephen cold there there isn't a show that Brock Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable then then maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public has\nChanged just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or sending your home and I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier\nAnd the rise of Gingrich net moment with a meal what that moment came from with Gingrich looking for a way around with at the time where the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich third term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he use ...\nFind and develop a relationship with a new audience draw a line from that and how Gingrich is legal to build his career as rise in the house around that fast forward to Donald Trump or to dump Trump to\nTelevision obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter\nDonald Trump identified through Twitter away to go around not just the news media but the entertainment media is well this is so engaged in politics now and to directly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties with CSPAN and Trump was doing with Twitter and and I think there's a real common thread there well let's go back\nThen in the way way back machine one more time\nTo Nineteen Ninety nine Donald Trump was people forget was involved with politics even at the time he flirted mentally and even in reality with presidential runs long before he was ever successful he went on meet the press\nBack in Nineteen Ninety nine and had some thoughts about somebody that we've already talked about Pat Buchanan the insurgent right wing politician in the Republican Party\nFor his Hitler lover I guess he's an anti Semite he doesn't like the black sea doesn't like the games I I I it's just incredible that anybody could have raised this guy and maybe I'll get four or five percent of the vote and it'll be a really staunch right wacko vote I'm not even sure if it's right it's just a lack of them\nAnd I just can't imagine that anybody can take them seriously\nDonald Trump sounded van about Pat Buchanan how John McCain sounded about Donald Trump\nJust a couple of years ago calling

do we the people had any idea what is actually contained within the four corners\nWill we don't have any sort of specific snow and this is certainly something that is confidential and not a something that is generally released to the public and there are no plans at this point according to the Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley for any of this to be made public a despite clearly a\nFair amount of interest among Democrats to make this public and certainly I think among the Trump a chunk of the American public to to learn what's in there or what we do know\nOf them are people who are friends of judge Kavanaugh's during high school that would be mark judge PJ Smith Tim God that and Chris Garrett\nA as well as one friend of a Ford's that's legal in Kaiser who all confirmed that they

according to a to a an official nine people spoke with the the FBI in total um but again a lot of this is\nOne that you know we don't know what all the FBI was told in this uh and likely we're not going to get a full picture but what we do have so far as what a chairman Grassley has said and that is that there is nothing in there that the committee and the public at this point didn't already\nKnow so where is the report right now physically I mean how our senators looking at it because it's extremely sensitive every reporter in Washington wants to get a look at it and in every

Olympics\nWelcome to the world famous American ... them in Rio de Janeiro Brazil for the opening ceremony of ... or ...\nOr if not the Olympics do you think of the host of the twenty fourteen feet for World Cup\nNeymar has got a goal or maybe your mind wanders back even further to two thousand and one when Brazil was predicted to become one of the world's top economies by twenty fifty\nFour now Russia India and China wreck for short but there is nothing short amount of the list of goals and ambitions he's constantly lay down and our second annual summit joining me now to talk about the\nOlympics the world cup one of the most exciting emerging markets in the world to Brazil was once heralded as Latin America's crown jewel\nBut then it was hit with a one two punch of a massive corruption scandal and as stunning economic collapse now unemployment in Brazil is Thirteen percent the country has sixty thousand homicides per year on average and its current president boasts of an approval rating\nOf just three percent all of that is backdrop to Brazil's upcoming presidential elections\nFar right populist jogger both in our is facing off against the leftist his rival Fernando had died on Sunday\nAnd the lead up to the election has already been packed with drama including boss in our owes near fatal stabbing last month and we're here to talk about what the election means for Brazil and\nHow what happens in Brazil will reverberate across both America's Monica to bowl is he or she is senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics she's also director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins university\nAnd she she's here with me in the studio Monica thanks for being here thank you for having me uh Brian winter is editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the counsel of the Americas he joined us over Skype from Sao paulo in Brazil Brian thanks for being here\nHello Todd happy to be with you good to talk to you and power ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center he's also with us here in Studio ... thanks to you for being here pleasure to be a well Brian you're the one in Sao paolo so let me give you honors here to start\nA let's start with the nitty gritty who is ... and our most Americans might not be familiar with him as ... as a retired\nArmy captain who has been in Congress for nearly three decades now\nUm but despite having sat in Congress her so much time he he shows open loading for ah for the legislative body I mean here said over the years numerous times that the Congress is dysfunctional and it should be closed\nUm he's also advocated torture of his political or\nThat message for a long time was was regarded as marginalized here I mean he was not a popular figure\nBut in the last couple of years because of this historic economic crisis that you mentioned Todd those messages um or resonating a lot more with people when they did in the past and now here we are with this presidential election coming up on Sunday\nAnd he has a ten point lead and old over his nearest rival it looks like there will be a runoff vote which would be on October twenty eighth\nAnd that was that was a close call right now between him and and the\nGuy who's likely to face with this Fernando had died\nBut it's it's just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty to twenty fifty and this seemed\nLike just such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of last\nMilitary rule from Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen eighty five but being here this week and talking to people I mean I there's a lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our all even if it does mean a return to you know the more authoritarian ways of the past year\nSome people just both real Bryan we are going to work on your sky blind a little bit uh we'll we'll get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to a Monica what about Fernando had died in in contrast he's not as\nFiery as ... in our with correspondent has been described by some as Trump being or maybe more akin to do ... in the Philippines likes to waive guns around and say that drug dealers should be shot or threatened to summer summarily execute them what about his opponent for for a Fernando ... what do we know about him\nSo what we know about him um is that he's not a an organic member of the Workers Party the P. T. um he's someone who sort of an outsider when you look at the composition of the tea far less so\nNot he's a moderate um but the leadership of the Workers Party of the PTA currently it very radicalized so it's very different\nFrom the time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty three I'm twenty ten when the party really did take the ... center left stamped so the party at south now is very much hard last um the candidate though is\nThat being said did the real big problem in retail at the moment is that there is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party\nBoth an hour oh I'm In there and type ... so these elections are very strange because they had become elections about not who necessarily voters actually went to the president but about who voted not to my friend and\nWe're going to talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft we are going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to\nThe idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking billions of dollars in bribes which has been a major problem we're gonna talk all about that Apollo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do\nCome out to the polls of what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think there are more weary than a decisive in terms of going in there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally uh eighty percent of the voters show up or we may have less of a proportion this time or\nOne important feature here is how many voters real spoiled their their vote will leave it blank will cancel the vote because that is important whoever gets a fifty percent of the salad votes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen the Sunday\nUh we're both from when they more likely according to the late disposes that we go to a runoff\nBut the mood people are angry people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil or\nRegardless if they are the less from the left from the writer from the center people feel absolutely fed up with politics with politicians and that\nThere is no alternative because there's not going to be emitted very cool in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics now right I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm both\nAn arrow has a history of violent rhetoric he's been photographed waving machine guns around as I mentioned he he likes to fantasize about his opponents or or drug dealers or thieves being shot but there's been some actual violence in this campaign last month ... was actually ...\nIs standing among voters in Brazil\nIn a way I mean it it was adding all of us were paying to see a political violence at that level and I was personally awful for for both scenario he he almost died by his own account and and those are the doctors that treated him\nPolitically I think it's fair to say that it was helpful um because the plan by the more centrist candidates in this race was to spend these last couple of weeks attacking both scenario as much as possible and on TV ads and elsewhere and and because of this attack against him and because of the resulting\nPublic sympathy they really had to tone down or in some cases eliminate totally their attacks it's also allowed ... to stay fairly quiet and not articulate his plans what he would do if he gets elected as much as the otherwise would have had to I mean he either as a huge\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from

what's happening in Brazil might seem familiar to Americans in the wake of the twenty sixteen us presidential elections\nMy guests are Monica to both senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics Brian winter is the editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and they cancelled the ... of the Americas\nAnd Paolo ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center and you had been sending us your message is one of the listeners\nDrew emails I was in northwest Brazil last month staying with a gay black friend he is all in for ... people are so fed up after the carwash scandal they will go for anything that isn't part of the Workers Party\nNow Monica before the break you were telling us about car wash the actual car wash and abroad offensive corruption scandal\nOr is it over ... have have all of the [noise] I don't want to mix metaphors but have all the wellhead all the cars been overturned it opened up and cleaned out in car wash\nWell it is winding down um so the bulk of it has already has already occurred but let me go back in time just a little bit because it is important to put into context to think\nThe most important I'm finding have love I had to\nOr a car wash worrying twenty Fifteen and twenty teens and at that time I'm president Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party was Brazil's leader she had been reelected in twenty fourteen and he was president at the time [noise] um she lives in peace\nHere but one of the moving parts was the fact that a she had lost control of her of her coalition and her her coalition had\nUm a number of other political parties that war implicated in the car wash findings in the car wash probing the plea bargains 'em and everything else that started to come out publicly in terms of this particular investigation\nShe was she didn't she never did anything to actually stop the investigation which was really a positive thing\nUm but that was one of the things that actually lead to her downfall because the the impeachment that she suffered\nWas really very much politically motivated by the need that some of these political parties in her coalition had to try to at least slow love my job to if not stop it all together and this is a very important element when we look at the degree of polarization that currently exists in Brazil\nBecause of the people who still defend the workers' party and still defend the P. T.\nThey go back to the impeachment of earth that as one major argument for why you know things that the Workers Party has been let's say unfairly treated and the way that the that that things have gone down\n[noise] Matt writes to us or on email I had a Brazilian friend years back who called his home country the greatest country that never was meaning to Brazil\nHas had such Richards in terms of natural resources but it is not had the government or the leadership to make it a competitor with the United states up Paulo Matt makes a good point Brazil was\nCelebrated as the rising star not only of Latin America of emerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned it at the top\nAre now horrible recession horrible corruption what happened in Brazil where was the Brazil that that hosted the Olympics in was and was on the way up\nWell I think Brazil believe too much in the magic that it's a country protests and\nCan be great and forgot to do the necessary things you do in order to build the country or one of the major be trails is precisely the workers are too far to the was led by a man born in poverty\nOr that to build this very successful bar to own initially ethics in politics\nThere is this sense after\nThe national economics producer of commodities had a wonderful moment Barbara too was reduced and that is what led to this impression that Brazil was unstoppable well a than reality hits a\nRuler made a very bad choice and his successor a\nAnd there are a lot of I shot Duquesne\nAnd the magic would disappear or what we have today is a consequence and this is what I think what that she'll be positive and all of this we cannot blame others for our problems this crisis was produced in Brazil by Brazilians are\nAnd another thing that the sport should the positives is the fact that the states in Brazil was basically broke\nAnd we have run off the money or\nAll that dream now has to be has ended and the nightmare has to be calling from that from a ... reality ... basis where the government says run all the money we have to adjust the economy\nThe measures necessary to do that are very dos and unpopular and none of the candidates have explain exactly why the holiday plans to come from the ships\nNow Bryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Bryan that you recently wrote where you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in two sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion was too many BS privileges for the elite\nNot enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that tourists conclusion well if you look around\nRight now at the field of candidates there's there's one thing that all Brazilians agree on which is that they find the candidates running for president to be an inspiring um the vast majority of people here as we've said during the program\nI feel like they're voting against somebody rather than voting for somebody and the consequences of that is is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived here during that era when things were going really well which you've mentioned touch the degree of cynicism a degree of disbelief\nThat people have in their system of government is just amazing and you know it's part of a global trend I mean we've seen this happen in places like turkey in Hungary and elsewhere around the world\nBut this democratic recession as some people have called it really is especially strong here\nReputation of its politicians because of this corruption scandal than virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the Pew Research center and twenty Seventeen found\nThat just eight percent of Brazilians say representative democracy is a very good form of government that was the lowest of thirty eight countries that that that you surveyed\n... and that just shows you the climate here right now and the reason why many people fear that both denaro if elected would basically have carte blanche to take a hard right turned it could involve the curtail moment of civil civil liberties and and and other things I I in my time\nAnd this week um I've had meetings with people from civil society and the press and others who you know these are serious people not prone to panic or anything like that who are talking openly about the possibility of exile\nGuy and this just blew me away I mean it it's a Brazil that I've read about in history books you know going back to previous periods of military rule Nineteen sixty four was the last two I thought that that was real Brazil that had been firmly relegated to the history books and you know\nMaybe maybe maybe they are maybe it is getting a little\nBit melodramatic in some quarters but but they're real fears and and and people are scared right\nNow well Brian you mentioned a statistic that was disturbing only eight percent of Brazilians say representative democracy is the best form of government now I'm an right to the point of\nFrying Ramirez emails us why are we so concerned about the right versus the left in Brazil ... is another ... he's an air to want a ... all these dictator dictator wannabes\nWho are being resurrected in Europe and Asia and now in Latin America all of them are low for their corruption their narcissism and a total lack\nOf democracy and Paolo in the United states it's been said more than once that a ... is a Brazilian version of Brazilian analog of president Donald Trump they're both right wing they're both populists\nAre these are
