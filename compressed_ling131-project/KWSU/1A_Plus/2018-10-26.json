A. M. U. dot org let me get to a few more of your comments on the ... fall out and then we will move on to a few more stories\n... ... email us Saudi relationship make no mistake is a relationship of shared interests not a relationship on shared values whatsoever\nBrian email of course it's deplorable that the Saudis murdered this journalist is it not also deplorable that we are profiting from the sale of weapons being used by the Saudis to kill ...\nThose are two things that we have discussed earlier in this week we spend a whole hour on Yemen and this kind of proxy war taking place there we discuss that this week and you'll find that conversation and every segments of every broadcast on line at so one a dot org because that's the word ... the number one letter a dot org\nThe United nations estimates the group of migrants heading on foot towards the U.S through Mexico currently has about seven thousand people traveling north that number fluctuates course\nThis group of migrants has become the target of President Trump and other Republicans during the upcoming mid terms car and what do we know about the folks who are in this caravan who are they worded they come from and and what made them start heading for the U.S border\nWhere um for the most part they seem to be on migrants that started off in Central America that have been moving up through Mexico that are heading to the U.S border and this is that something has been organized to kind of make the point of the plight of the migrants that um I have been trying to travel on very very long way to get to the U.S border and are seeking a company that states for\nEither reasons of economics at attraction or because they are freeing some sort of threat\nUm and that that is sort of thing that happens every day and less organized fashion it's become now a weapon or for that type of fair for time to use an advance in the mid term elections they look at all these scary people coming towards our border there might be middle Easterners and they're you know how do we know that there aren't you not bad people in that group but just to quote his terminology it is\nA and this is kind of a poking at\nThe that that the existing and tension that exists in this country between people who are sympathetic toward that people who wants to come to the United states for various reasons of personal safety and economic instability and everything else\nAnd those people who think a scary outsiders don't let them in its place real well let's face it they're trying to whip up his base in advance within the term elections because there are public kind of need to hold on for dear life\nTo flip to Democrats and that will be at the problematic for example in the last two years his first term so it is a classic at a very emotional issue for people on both sides of this issue and this is a classic uh politicking for how it's being portrayed right now I'm In an eye\nOn television on nearly as as we are like two weeks out\nLoud makes away from around the planet which and everybody's going to cast their ballots healing how they feel about you know that she's that affect the country and how the president's Capitan let them\nAway before we continue talking about the caravan I'm Sorry I forgot to clarify something earlier and what we were discussing Michael Goldfarb raise the point\nAbout treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and we clarified that he did not attend the conference this so called Davos in the desert that his troops but just to be clear the treasury secretary did meet with Saudis crown prince Mohammed bin ... on Monday in Riyadh he did not attend the conference\nBut he and the crown prince did meet one on one earlier this week on Monday just by way of clarification\nRavi president troops sent ... President Trump sent troops\nTo the U.S Mexico border during the spring defense secretary James Mattis is authorized deploying eight hundred more troops to the southern border give us a sense of what role these troops might be expected to play there and how that might factor into this whole saga regarding the caravan\n[noise] well it it really is as car ruined was pointing out to apply as thoughts to play into the political debate here in the United states about these migrants making their way to to the United states and the whole notion of securing the border is also is is a strange one on this because\nI mean if you look at who these migrants are and what they're escaping from they are tired they're hungry they're escaping countries like Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala where they are escaping violence they are extremely poor they they as they are walking up a north towards the United states\nOn their agenda and their hopes and dreams quite clearly is to try and seek asylum in the United states why because they think that they could have better lives\nIn the United states they think that that children would have better lives and really there is no greater testament to American soft power that you have you know essentially all around the world people who want to vote with their feet and come to the the the United states and settle\nA and have children and have better lives than simply\nI guess Republican rhetoric that play into the the idea that some migrants who are coming are coming I'm a you know as sources of great danger when in fact a ... you know if you look at the pictures of who they are and how they're coming in they are anything but\nAnd I also do want to point out uh current mention that President Trump or use it to the ... a A R mentioned\nThat uh these migrants are Middle Eastern well for one there's actually no evidence that points to the fact that they could be Middle East and perhaps more importantly he was using um Middle Eastern as a flood of sorts which which\nWe ... we should we should just clarify vice president Mike Pence said that there it's possible that mixed in with these thousands of migrants who were from Central America there may be a few dozen who were Middle Eastern and might have you know ... ... ferry is aims for the country\nAt that in fact the right thank you for the car for vacation that but the the point I was getting too is that the use of the of of of Middle East and that's just the um ... is extremely dangerous because it it ... then tries to create the impression that being Middle East and\nI'm means you're dangerous so that you're a terrorist and and and that too is is is a dangerous loaded way of looking at as common was pointing out again a movement that happens very often that you know migrants from from those parts of the world often try to make their way to the United states\nAnd the reason why this has become a bigger thing right now numbering into thousand is because it has been politicized here in the United states\nMichael Goldfarb I Wonder if we should be careful with the language we use to describe this large group of people a number of you have comments with to us about that with these this terminology including the use of the word migrants\nMaria writes I Am Honduran I was born and raised in Honduras I came to the U.S to study and now I live and work here this quote unquote caravan is a cry for help cry of desperation from my people who will risk their lives to escape the extreme poverty and violence that I Know Israel\nThey are indeed refugees seeking refuge please don't blame them blamed the corruption that has rotted the Honduran government\nAnd dug in Anthony tweet they are not migrants they are asylum seekers words matter now Michael Merriam Webster is might go to in terms of the English language Miriam Webster defines a migrant as one who migrate such as\nCrops a refugee is one that fleas especially a person who leads to a foreign country or power to escape danger or persecution what do you make of the words that we're using to describe this [noise] you know just it just it was as you've been talking about this I I I suddenly had woody\nOld song about about a group of migrants being sent back to Mexico and the Nineteen thirties and their plane crashed and they were called deportees it's a beautiful song you you look it up and ... listeners who should streets YouTube after the show and and give it a listen there are many versions of it\nYeah you you know look I and I do think that in this case there there is a distinction you know we have\nA human wave coming out of sub Saharan Africa and the horn of Africa towards Europe and it's had a destabilizing effect on politics here as well\nAnd and I I Would identify most of these folks as as being migrants as opposed to people who come from countries which\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from progressive insurance

O. X. P. O. P. in your app store and we'll share some of your stories on Monday\nOn one day\nNow to our discussion with car and diversion of the Washington Post roughly ... of foreign policy magazine\nAnd Michael Goldfarb with the first rough draft of history the host and creator of that podcast probably let me come to you though I Wonder what you think of the overall message of Tim Cook speech the c._e._o. of apple we heard him refer to the data industrial complex which has been a phrase it's been quoted\nComplex what did you make of of cooks remarks\nI thought these were really strong words and coming from a taxi or perhaps the strongest we've seen so far now what he didn't stay in that speech was he didn't mention Google he didn't mention Facebook\nAnd that's perhaps because I mean well he doesn't want to go that far but but also because apple is a business is quite different from Google and Facebook apple doesn't it's not in the the uh the ad tracking business the way Facebook and Google both are\nBut I think what all of these companies know collectively is that whether they like it or not regulation of some form of some farm is is on its way it's coming and so at some level of the other they have all endorsed uh GDP are which is Europe's data protection bill\nAnd I think they're beginning to imagine that some version of that will at some stage be implemented in the United states and the only question that is is what kind of language will be in that what it within tail\nAnd and and and I think what cook has tried to do in the speech again very strong words in his visit to Europe is to try and come out ahead of it knowing that this is going to happen anyway to try and appear to be one of the uh the tech support to uh all of a potential data privacy laws in the United\nStates we should be clear also GDP are as the general data protection regulation it's just a new area law that protects the privacy the data privacy of individuals within the EU or even the export of their personal data outside the EU if you've noticed re in the last few months\nThat a lot of the website you go to have had these pop up saying hey we use cookies on this website we may be tracked your information click here to accept\nThat was those websites complying with GDP are that's why they all had to begin putting those pop ups on those sites another story about privacy that caught our attention the British newspaper the telegraph\nPublished an investigation on Tuesday into a wealthy businessman who was accused by multiple employees of racist and sexist mistreatment the story had the headline the British me to scandal which cannot be revealed\nThat's because the accused was granted an injunction against the newspaper to prevent it from publishing his name but then this happened at Britain's house of lords\nFeel it's more juicy under parliamentary privileged to blame for green all the individual in question\nThe story which is clearly in the public interest\nThat was the voice of lord pain or Baron Hain of nice in the British house of lords using British parliamentary privileged to name the billionaire at the center of this story Michael Goldfarb what's behind this what makes this\nIs such a big deal it sounds like it's kind of an example of clear example of the very significant differences between free speech laws in the u._k. and in the U.S\nWell that's certainly part of it just wrote in in this particular case um have a parliamentary privileges is pretty\nUnique tools you can say things in parliament that you can't say outside and and not suffer and any libel actions and Peter hand was a working he'd been approached by some of the women who had spoken to the Daily Telegraph\nThis this guy a Phillip Green is you know a fairly typical contemporary entrepreneur yet he was a night to by Tony Blair for services to retail is set up\nA series of of um clothing shops over over the decades and made himself area very wealthy indeed and um apparently was just the kind of ball she would expect it was a bully and he was\nBeing sexually harassed people and\nLike Harvey Weinstein when when he settled up there were no disclosure clauses inserted into the settlements\nAnd the difference of course is that in the U.S New York times and the New Yorker can report that Harvey Weinstein is this that and you know the details we can't get because of these on disclosure agreements but at least we know his name and here in Britain is something else\nYou know and moving oh go ahead Michael go ahead no no because I could go on about this guy forever and I went [laughter]\nWe appreciate it on\nI was just gonna say it's an interesting case really because of the way that the British law has restructuring to try to have that that that this question which is the greater good hair right because this is that\nThat that need to know that it's already been a question is can you know the little guy the little girl in this instance you know stand up against a big powerful wealthy usually now I didn't player who's pulling things at at eating for getting things that they shouldn't be doing but because of power and\nInfluence are able to get away with that

A. M. U. dot org\n... before we move on to our next story I Wonder if you could respond to that tweet from Michael that reads this just further reinforces that people solely look for media that confirms their already set beliefs\nHow do we break out of this and show the people that does you disagree with are still human Adam [noise]\nBoy uh I don't know [laughter]\nI think uh the technologically enabled a fracturing of media is a really really significant factor in the status of our public life right now\nOn the other hand I'm not sure that it's the causal agent um it might be a corollary uh\nI think that um you know we can talk all day about the norms as to the discourse breaking down but a nice that's very real trend are actual substantive policy disagreements between Americans differences in fundamental values\nThat are really really wide and were perhaps paper over for a lot of years by the media mano culture and now we're able to see them for what they are\nI Am personally kind of amazed that more political violence doesn't happen in the United states given the depths of these differences\nUm I don't think it's just in how we talk and who we are talking to and who were listening to I think a lot of what we're experiencing hears about fundamental differences in what we believed to be important in life and what we want government to do\n... we had fundamental differences forever in what we believe that but I think\nThat the increase in rhetoric I think I'm demonizing people making people your enemy making that needed the enemy of the people has made a difference and I think that people don't generally talk to each other anymore there's not enough people that go up I mean I kind of ...\nLook at their phones and they are in their little bubble\nAnd Eugene I think it's important to note that and I don't know if you encounter the\nWorking for the Washington Post but certainly I Do on a program that's on NPR is that the people who comments on our show or not just our fans are critics listened to I mean I understand the idea about the division but if you hate NPR so much how do you know what we sat on one aid to criticize us if you have the Washington Post so much\nHow do you know what was printed there to criticize\nYeah and quite frankly I think that that a behavior is exemplified most from the president himself who really hate CNN but seems to watch a lot of it and it and I I'm blown away by how many people are are engaging that's who don't want us to do what\nIt is that we're doing and and it's unfortunate because I think we are a need criticism or the media needs to be criticized we need to be held accountable but we need to be criticized well so that we can serve the public better\nWe're going to keep moving from the story again just a quick caution as you listened to the coverage of the story over the weekend the please just remember that the stories moving really really fast we're going to try really hard not to jump to any conclusions\nAbout what has happened there already been some details of this story that had been clarified a walk back so that is common in a fast moving breaking story like this keeping your on your NPR member station for the latest and an eye on NPR dot org it's a few more of your comments before we move on\nMatt emailed if Trump is responsible for the bombs are Democrats responsible for the shooter at the Republicans baseball team practice both of these statements are untrue believe mass referring to the the congressional baseball game which Republican Congressman Steve beliefs of Louisiana was injured\nPhilip emailed the suspicious packages may have originated in Florida but the perpetrator or perpetrators tours are not necessarily based there the Unabomber lived in Montana but traveled to Utah and the bay area to physically male his devices in order to deceive law enforcement\nAll right let's keep moving on with some other stories and if the story continues to move in the next few minutes we'll certainly let you know but let's talk a little bit more about politics particularly with President Trump he was at a rally this week in Houston and he made headlines for a different set of remarks listen\nWas not care about our country so\nReally we're not supposed to use that word you know what I'm a nationalist [noise]\nEugene Scott I Wonder if we can get to a clear definition of this term share what exactly is a nationalist I mean there's this ... is it typically consider to be what President Trump says it is\nKnowing and neither is the global if I'm a according to President Trump to to be charitable or a nationally it's it's just someone who puts America First um\nBut the reality is anyone with a it's a historical context of nationalism knows that it is a worldview embraced on either rising I that has led to um you know genocide and violence and separating people not like yourself a from a spaces that would give them rights that uh\nWe we deem a central and important to human beings um and so a Trump you know early in his campaign I'm really distance himself from the ... the term nationalist when we saw\nA Steve Bannon associated with it primarily because\nUh the ... the form of national let them back what's most are familiar with a band and in the bribe our community west vat of white nationalism which we've seen um\nYou know sweep Europe and I even hate groups in the states um and so it's it's been it's been ... by most people to be problematic to see Trump embrace it um while misrepresenting it\nOr put him on the receiving end up significant criticism\nAdam reduce the I'd love to chime in on this I Know that you are a stickler and rightly so for precision in language and I'm Wondering what your take is\nOn the use of the word nationalist versus say patriot particularly because words like nationalist often heard in in phrases like white nationalism global list has connotations of being anti Semitic that give us parse the words parcel language for us here\nI mean I think Eugene has already done a pretty good job of that I'm a I'm a little bit mystified by this whole story um the ... the idea that for President Trump to say hey I'm a nationalist is remarkable is kind of nuts to me um\nAmerica First his secondary campaign slogan is a perfect crystal ... of nationalism it's for him to put a label on it is I think totally in consequential it would be like if President Trump got in front of a group of people and\nThat you said it but you know it's it's it's a truth right in front of us\nI think a lot of why the comment has gotten attention is that yes I'm as Eugene said um nationalism has really really bad track record in the twentieth century of leading the genocide\nAnd World War Z I'm On the other hand I don't I think that some people have been a rounding nationalist up to white nationalist and that's a pretty big trip\nNow you could make a very cogent argument that President Trump is functionally a white nationalist in terms of his rhetoric in terms of his policies that that's an arguable point\nUm but he didn't say I'm a white nationalist he said I'm a nationalist anti is manifestly so I don't get why this is a big deal\nA few of your comments about President Trump's word choices Mary hail emailed when Trump recently called for unity she did so in a tone but it's clearly not his usual one it is as if he was saying to his followers I don't mean this but they're making me say at his actions in the word soon after showed that he really didn't mean it\nMichael emailed I've been hearing a lot about President Trump's rhetoric in regards to this bomb scare what about the calls for action by leading Democrats such as Maxine Waters the chicken when they go low and harassed them in public crowd no on Tuesday at the White House President Trump defended his remarks here's what he said\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from CSP certified
