state level from immigration to gun control state houses and governors are passing bills and voters are approving ballot initiatives today we're launching a special series called the state we're in\nEach Monday This month we'll explore the bills and ballot initiatives dominating the debates in state capitals what are the state level trends tell us about the political direction of the country\nThis time around we'll explore trends in gun legislation and proposals around the nation today also marks one year since the mass shooting in Las Vegas at an open air country music festival it left fifty eight people dead and hundreds of people wounded\nAfter that shooting many people called from on more gun control measures particularly on bump stocks some states passed bumped stock restrictions other major restrictions went nowhere\nBut this year some things shifted after another mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida a gunman walked into that school and killed Seventeen students and staff\nThat sparked a movement led by students survivors and states around the nation started restricting got access including some states with Republican governors\nJoining us in Studio to discuss it is Scott Greenberg executive editor of state line a journalism project of the Pew Charitable trust Scott welcome back to one day thanks very much for having me joining us from NPR in New York is Chris Brown ... president of the breed\nIn San Antonio is Richard Feldman the president of the independent firearm owners association he's a former

start with you this has been a heck of a year for the gun control movement and also the gun rights movement in the U.S\nGive us the broad overview of what's been going on as I understand that there are about fifty new laws restricting got access that move forward including in fourteen states that have Republican governors right\nThat's right and uh we tracked there since um\nThe shooting in Parkland, Florida a last February because uh it what we found and this is really interesting was that up until Parkland even with uh the many other mass shootings unfortunately that have taken place\nA that for the most part states reacted by expanding gun rights I'm up until Parkland Parkland seems to have shifted something or perhaps a because the students there um\nBecame so politically active and so outspoken\nA so quickly or that following that um incident it seems that ah states have moved from the other direction as you noted there have been about fifty new laws restricting access to guns ranging from a bump stock bands to allowing authorities to temporarily disarm\n[noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James

or email one day at W. A. M. U. dot org Richard by the way before we keep going we mentioned that you are a former lobbyist for the already you're not president of a group called the independent firearm owners association\nFor those who may not have heard of it that's that's a separate organization from\nRelationship between the two I headed up the firearm industry's trade association during the Nineteen nineties\nGotcha okay thank you I just wanted to make sure we're kind of clear on on the the distinction between the organization and the and the n._r._a.\nScott Greenberger I Wonder if we could talk a little bit more about red flag laws and their impact the Jerry Brown the governor of California the outgoing four term governor of California\nJust vetoed a bill that would have expanded that states red flag ball Jerry Brown is a Democrat very progressive but also thoroughly pragmatic and has pushed back on Democrats in an array of ways so this is an unprecedented in terms of\nKim vetoing something the Democrats would have wanted but what do you make of the veto\nWell a ... you know California of course is a very blue state of progressive state and already had um\nA a relatively speaking a pretty strong gun control laws in place so I'm at the Jerry Brown has a governed as say a pragmatic a liberal and progressive and so um [noise]\nUh you know in this case he felt like it perhaps you know with some of the concerns that ah Richard raise that uh\nIt went a little too too far um and a return note it's a question of of balance but I Would add also I think it's interesting that generally speaking\nA that a lot of the debate um\nPost a Parkland tests focused on\nA these so called red flag laws or I'm\nA limiting the gun access to guns for people a domestic abusers\nYou know the argument or the n._r._a. argument for for such a long time was that a guns don't kill people people kill people and it seems that now rather than trying to revive a for example on assault weapons ban uh the assault weapons ban from the nineties\nOr people who are in favor of more um uh safeguards gun control are pushing on red flag laws are they're pushing on background checks and it seems like that's a potential uh common ground between people who are\nA very strongly support their Second Amendment or what they view as their Second Amendment gun rights and and folks who would like a um some more uh controls and safeguards speaking\nOf the end are a governor Larry Hogan of Maryland who's a Republican had an a minus rating from the national Rifle Association here he is endorsing a red flag law in ...\nOut of the hands of the mentally ill and people with criminal backgrounds that's why we will push for and support what is known as red flag legislation\nIn general this policy would allow family members for law enforcement to petition the court for a lethal violence protective order issued by a judge which were prohibited individual from having any firearms or ammunition\nIf the judge has clear evidence that the family member poses a an immediate and present danger um of causing injury to themselves or to others [noise] individuals with a mental illness should not have access to fire off period\nThat is Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland worth noting that he was a minus rating from the un already dropped to ... feet\nAs a result of his support of these kinds of red flag laws Chris I Wonder what impact you think that that kind of influence would have on more states passing these kinds of extreme risk laws\nI think it has a positive impact absolutely a and I think governor Hogan\nActually there is a he's doing the right thing and be you know he's a politician he has to be aware that that has an impact on his NRA rating it has an impact on the rating that Brady Gibson as well and I think it relates back to the initial point\nThat I made that is part post Parkland really there is a groundswell of activism on this issue a huge new slate of polls that had been taken\nWhich show in every state across this country\nA vast majority well over fifty percent normally in the seventies or supporting exactly these kinds of measures\nThey're sensible measures they're pragmatic measures and they balance appropriately uh the you know the second Amendment rights of of gun owners\nWest or the idea that we all want to be safe in our communities one of the most heartbreaking components of my job is getting polling data back and focus group information that really yields two different things and I think it's really important to think about these laws in this context first\nAmericans overall when they ask about their fear associated with being shot one of the most profound quotes I got back from a recent poll is\nIt is very concerning thank the second is many Americans are actually ashamed\nAbout the epidemic of gun violence in this country and they want pragmatic solutions site certainly applied governor Hogan forgiving the right thing here but I think he like many politicians are looking at what their constituents want\nAnd moving forward knowing that these are popular and populist positions to take\nA here you Chris in terms of the pragmatic argument but you know when it comes to gun laws their constituents in their constituents I mean Vermont is a good example of that I mean ... was one of the states to ban bump stocks as part of a larger package of legislation on guns to hear back in April for much governor Phil Scott who's a Republican who had an a rating from the n._r._a.\nSigned these laws in these bills into law\nNobody's got said he changed his mind about them after police\nFoiled and alleged shooter's plans to storm a local high school and basically kill as many people as possible now here is some of the sound from

hear that moment from the signing ceremony ... what does that tell you about the the nature of this debate in states across the country\nI think in many ways the pro gun community led by the national Rifle Association is somehow corner good self by its own success on the politics\nOf this issue transcends the policy of this issue and therein lies so much of the problem in getting [noise]\nCells

Greenberg or a few more different kinds of laws that we should touch on before our time is up\nWe should talk about the minimum age is to purchasing long guns and rifles four states California Hawaii Illinois and Florida passed new laws that would raise the minimum age from Eighteen to Twenty one uh Florida State representative who say leave out who was a Republican\nSponsored new legislation on new gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida he had an eighth grade from the n._r._a.\nSerious speaking on W F ... in Miami about why he agreed to raise the legal age this is an edited version of his interview\nA determining what aims someone can do something is a judgment call and we do it in in many areas of our of our law making and so I think it was for that on was the fact that you had an Eighteen year old a who did purchase this weapon I think I think without that from taking effect you probably wouldn't have seen that [noise]\nWhat about law abiding\nFloridians who are Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old some of whom have gone and served our country\nParticularly that group of people that you mentioned are covered in the mall so if you have if you're a correctional officer if you're a parole officer if you're a law enforcement officer or or you served in the military society has already said that you're trained and can carry a firearm so this bill would not impair that even if those ages\nThat state rep Hosea reliever in Florida Republican state rep speaking to us for TV in Miami Chris I Wonder how you think it will play out with this law particularly because the n._r._a. is challenging it in court\nYeah than our as challenging unquote I think a Marion Hammer has done a very effective lobbyists there for the n._r._a. for a long time um had a suit filed within twenty four hours of that measure passing\nI think that it will certainly withstand judicial scrutiny from our interview 'em and be upheld and I think it's a natural reaction to the a mass shooting involving you know that are often\nUm with school individuals who are within that timeframe\nOf Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will know that Florida passed a package of laws at the minimum age being one all of which were a really designed to address the the type of issues that we saw\nA from Parkland at the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in a home where he stayed on secured\nAnd that's why the extreme risk laws so important so we're seeing these kinds of package bills ah reviewed and introduced that the most notable point for me is it passed in the state of Florida\nThreat has long been one of the strongest a sort of ... of the ... legislative agenda and I think is very telling on obviously the reaction so Parkland and the the activism\nThat took place immediately following a the Parkland shooting\nI Would like to come back to save storage in a moment because by the way we did a program when we visited Salt Lake city\nAbout guns in the mountain west states and and the nature of gun suicide in the mountain west in which\nA state representative who joined us showed us one of the sea storage lockers that does open with your fingerprints I tried it it it works it's it's pretty fascinating you can find the conversation on line at our website vote one a dot org before we move on to other kinds\nOf gun legislation Richard Feldman\nThe ... has said that some measures like bump stock restrictions could be examined maybe through the administration's authority on a federal level rather than the state level\nOr we just kidding ourselves here should we just come out and just see the n._r._a. is not in favor of any new gun legislation that can be passed on a bipartisan basis are we trying to make the n._r._a. more ten fifth wheel and more collaborative than it really is\nWell first let's define something I'm always a little bit of a loss to understand when people talk about the n._r._a. on an endowment number the n._r._a. there five million NRA members [noise] um there's the board of directors that has the senior leadership\nThere that can psalms there are many and already\nThere's my uncle was a card carrying life member of the IRA and we'll show you his card on demand if you ask with great pride\nHas so many will\nMyself included um but I I I think we're talking about the senior leadership\nOf an already here and um again when I said earlier an array finds itself institutionally boxed in a corner\nOf if you're calling it gun control no matter what it is it could mandate that ah when you turn Twenty one you're given a gun they're almost institutional lake has to be against it because of the terminology in the political position of the terms\nGun control they don't mean what we sometimes think they mean are they mean different things to different people at different times but\nYou know what I mean I'm Talking about Wayne LaPierre Oliver North of the leadership of the national Rifle Association what we hear you know from the big ... the main figures who speak with a national voice for the n._r._a. it's the\nYou know the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun it's those ads within the last that say you know they are coming for our freedom and they use their media and the n._r._a. as you know ... you know liberties last safe place that in RA that's who I'm Talking about\nWhat you're talking about that's politics that's galvanizing the true believers that's about membership that's about fundraising\nThat's about or organizing for the next to political event both sides to it and there's nothing unusual about that\nSee it a little more distinctly in a firearm debate than others when we've been put on that side Scott Y. disorder sides I wanted to ah just ah to to add to that that you've seen on some of those issues issues you\nJust mentioned in perhaps a we're going to begin to see it on gun control as well that in cases where\nState legislatures are gridlocked and the power of a [noise]\nUm the gun lobby is such that uh that lawmakers won't pass anything\nI'm a there is another outlet in many states and that's about an issue of Washington state will have a ballot initiative in November that would raise the minimum age to buy a a\nSemi automatic rifle to Twenty one uh Oregon people in Oregon and supportive a similar measure came close to getting out on the ballot so we may see that I mean that's that was the pattern with marijuana legalization for example so that that might be a that might be coming in the future\nLet me get to a few more of your calls and comments we did get a call about speed gun legislation in Missouri\nFrom a person who was working for a democratic state reps office this is what she left in our inbox\nThis is Emily ... calling from Missouri state representative Tracy me curries office in two thousand sixteen Missouri has how spell six fifty six eliminating all permanent requirements for

do you think there's ... ... how do you think this will affect the confirmation battle though I mean I hear you about these other conversations I Need to be had in terms of whether or not Brett Kavanaugh makes it to the Supreme Court or not what impact do you think the last few days might have\nA ... one particular clip I saw on CNN was when I'm One of the senators missed questioning him about er an FBI investigation and he refused to answer he fall silent he he he explained that he was\nHoping to what the committee or would a welcome however hit he personally would not comment\nOn whether or not he would accept an FBI investigation and it was very interesting to watch his wife or her response to him because when he was not answering that question and she was staring at him very sternly and I always also wonder what exactly was she thinking when he refused to answer\nSenator Durbin of Illinois puts it right to travel and there's nothing to hide we should be open to any possibilities\nYeah David appreciate your calling in thanks very much and that was the question that Dick Durbin of Illinois put to Brett Kavanaugh and he paused for a long time and then Chuck Grassley who's the chairman of the committee a Republican chairman of the committee jump back in and then after that Rachel Mitchell question or for the G O P basically lost her job and then the GOP senator started jumping back in [noise]\nLet me get to some more of your comments David thanks very much for talking to us Catherine emailed\nAs a woman listening to Kavanaugh defend himself last Thursday I didn't find his presentation appropriate\nIt smacks of bullying and intimidation aside from that conspiracy theories like revenge from the Clintons aired in Senate testimony is a major disqualify or in my eyes before we bring our next guest professor fitzpatrick ... if I could ask you to respond\nTo Catherine particularly whether or not someone who began by making a partisan broadside can be trusted to sit on the Supreme Court at administer equal justice under law\nWell I'm you know I think we have to be realistic about all of this our Supreme Court justices come from the political world they work for president of one party and I'm often times or they have other experience in politics they are\nTo some extent partisan or in their outlook but they try to put that to the side as best they can when they get on the court\nAnd focus on the statutes the constitution the administrative regulations and I think they do a pretty good job obviously people's world view influences their decisions to some extent but\nI think we'll find that if judge Kavanaugh's confirmed\nHe is a successful justice well liked by his colleagues just like Clarence Thomas frankly a is today if you ask\nThe justices if they like Clarence Thomas they they they will tell you I don't dislike him I Love him so an Sonia Sotomayor came to Vanderbilt last year and talk to her students and she said that I Love Clarence Thomas and so\nI think we'll get beyond this um but they're certainly going to be some awkward moments for a year or two [noise]\nThat another voice to our conversation joining us now in Studio is Elizabeth why drop the president of the constitutional accountability center a public interest law firm as think tank based here in D.C Elizabeth walk I'm afraid to even you know let me start with a question that I Begin with\nSure of it and the testimonies we heard from professor Ford and judge Kavanaugh but how well that might affect the ultimate decision about whether Brett Kavanaugh should become an associate justice of the United states\nWell I think you know harkening back to what the caller uh just uh your your um listener just mentioned about the\nPresentation that judge Kavanaugh I made and talking about revenge of the Clintons\nYou know there's definitely been a divide between those who are centering Dr Ford and the other survivors of sexual assault\nAnd as we saw in judge Kavanaugh's opening centering the political talking about the Democrats talking about uh whether or not they should have leaked her letter and disregarded her request for anonymity you know I think that ah\nWhether or not you think Senator Feinstein should have\nTried to raise this another way earlier she was trying to respect that clear request for anonymity from this\nTraumatized survivor and maybe it's telling that Republicans would have just leaked it anyway and disregarded her request but Senator Feinstein was trying to give her the respect that she and her experience deserved\nAnd I think that trying to make that part of a political gain game like she came up with this decades long ... on to try to stop judge Kavanaugh from getting to the Supreme Court is frankly offensive it's offensive to\nHer and her experience and to the many many many many others who have experienced sexual assault\nAnd have not come forward because of fear because of shame because they worried frankly that what we might see in this case would be true for them that they would finally find their voice and the courage to come forward and it would not matter\nWonder Elizabeth if there was any way around the politicking of this if it was just bound to happen no matter what I mean we've got a lot of comments very critical of the Democrats alluding to what you just kind of reference fear of emailed\nThe Democrats are showing their ugly side and the people see right through their deception they should be ashamed but that would require morals which they lack\nAnd Joe emailed I'm a moderate conservative as are most of my friends we've discussed the Kavanaugh hearings and Democratic senators behavior extensively if the Democrats than their behavior will go unanswered I'm afraid they're mistaken\nAnd the courts both the lower court than the Supreme Court is broken and you know it it's certainly a problem but I think that that's kind of a dodge you know okay let's talk about that\nBut let's first talk about Dr Ford and are very credible testimony and allegations and what it means for judge Kavanaugh getting a job promotion to the Supreme Court I think it's very important to note this is not a criminal trial no one is at this point trying to hold him criminally liable\nSo it isn't a beyond a reasonable doubt kind of thing it said let's try to get all the facts which is what the FBI investigation shouldn't be doing and I think we'll get to that a sin and and then decide whether or not this is someone among other a possible candidate\nWho should be elevated to the Supreme Court and I think a lot of people would say if there's any doubt for the integrity of the Supreme Court than you should vote no\nSupport for NPR comes

revelations among people in your life once the story is shared\nWhat then\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a if someone's told you their story of being assaulted all

Democrats are promising that if Kavanaugh is confirmed and they take the house they will hold impeachment hearings on the alleged misstatements in the confirmation hearings and they range not only from\nA his testimony involving Dr Ford and his college classmates insistence that he was a heavy drinker even though he says he wasn't and so forth but also about alleged misstatements and the first part of the hearings where he said he didn't know about a emails involving lower court confirmations shutdowns ... programs and the evidence tested he did\nSo regardless of whether the Senate chooses to decide that a small misstatement as evidence\nWho's your mind but tweeted sometimes the partisan lens is overrated I Am a moderate Republican women and so many women that I have no experience to solve like Dr for describes a friend from my church a high school friend a cousin a neighbor we believe her because we have been her\nPamela tweeted this is an impossible situation I feel deeply sorry for Ford is she was obviously sexually assaulted by someone and they spent her life trying to get over it I also feel deeply for Kavanaugh as I have a father and brothers there was no way to prove his guilt or innocence\nI should also note that we've been getting a number of voice mail messages about this from across the country and even from around the world already in Hamburg, Germany left this note in our inbox the\nKavanaugh hearings have caught the attention of the German press ... title pretty side the opinion though his uniform it's an absolute shock at the lack of respect being shown by the Republican Senate toward the Supreme Court and its own history as the world's greatest deliberative body\nThe shock is not at the partisan tone to the hearing the right left battles are less gripe battles happened here too [noise]\nBut what's shocking is the tenor with which the Republicans have been speaking to the Democratic colleagues and the tenor with which the nominee himself used to address the Democratic senators Thursday\nAlready thanks very much for commenting to us in just by way of context to ... ... is a major paper in Germany if you remember our conversations about the Panama Papers the big international investigative report about money hidden in offshore bank accounts to do which is I took was one of the major papers that helped drive that forward\nI Wonder a professor for Patrick what's your take is on what all of this means\nFor just America's image around the world how the world is reflecting on us because of the way we're handling this\nWell after last presidential election I'm not sure image can get any worse um but uh you know I I think that it is a shame that the judicial nomination process has become so broken parties and\nUm and you know the Republicans are just as much to blame if the Democrats what they did to Merrick Garland after Justice Scalia passed away was unconscionable in my view and I frankly don't blame the Democrats for retaliated um with this nominee a and what's so\nTo come up with some major overhaul and and I think the one solution to kind of restore the dignity tore judicial confirmation process is it's a big change but I think it's a necessary change I think we have to ask do we think Supreme Court justices should have life tenure\nIf they didn't have served forty years it wouldn't be Armageddon every time someone retires and there's a replacement if presidents had a knowledge that every two years they get a Supreme Court nomination we would normalized this process\nAnd it would become more I'm sane [laughter] um and law professors have been proposing this Eighteen year term for Supreme Court justice\nYeah time you have her I've I've I've heard it was when I was just gonna ask you about that I've heard that suggested that if it was Eighteen years you know there are nine seats and you know every two years basically see what come open kind of like clockwork\nThat this might not be quite so much like oh we're making this decision that will look like and our children and our children's children it would still be a big deal but you know Eighteen is less than thirty or forty\nThe question is whether or not that's politically viable I Wonder if that just depends on whether we the American people are willing to\nPound the table and demanded until the law changes if not impossible to change the law it's just difficult but what what are you\nYeah I mean I think that's probably going to be an unlikely a proposal for the particular set it up right now um but you know I think that this isn't just about the Supreme Court in life tenure because\nI think it's about this particular nominee I don't see the issues around Brett Kavanaugh as being a case of quote unquote retaliation in front of the Democrats you know there are a lot of issues with this particular nomination and in addition to the fact that he would be taking over\nAnthony Kennedy's seat on the Supreme Court Kennedy being the vote that basically has preserved and meaningful access to abortion preserved major civil rights and protections and so on and so on you know\nThere's a vote that also wrote the decision in the ... the marriage equality was protected by the costumes\nRight we're talking marriage equality we're talking about housing discrimination we're talking about affirmative action and we're talking about environmental protection I mean this is a huge nomination but this particular nominee comes with a lot of issues you know my organization constitutional accountability center", "year": "2018",
