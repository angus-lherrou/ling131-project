A. M. U. dot org Katie you're on the ground in Michigan working on redistricting reform I Want to hear what you're up to in just a moment but first I Want to get a little more explanation of this larger issue and ... and let me start with you if you just explain what\nMandarin right so this is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after the descending all senses\nOf the census really starts the whole process\nOr the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives the states the official number of\nUh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get there is a really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method\nWhich I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years um but that that's how so every state's all fifty states get one\nMember of the house of representatives at least you know there are four hundred and thirty five so that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington he'll method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well uh but then it does\nThe the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth ah and that's how we figure out that um say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on uh the population shift and the relative populations of each state\nSo this happens every ten years and then every ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways of some legislatures have challenged\nUh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power or other states other legislators have more willingly given up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various courts here and there\nAre and the legislatures will then draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty or that the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and in the states have about a year to draw district lines\nEverybody knows pretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there and when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that that sort of the ... term for when a party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate in crazy ways in ways that\nWhere the the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power um and and and you know throughout the years\nOr every state has gone through its own hiccups with political gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now\nStates has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David your in Charlotte\nFollowing the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leaving we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a fence David of what's at stake politically with redrawing the district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform it\nI think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing states as a Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin\nYou might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sunday similar number of members of Congress both parties to Washington\nExcept the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrats to Washington that Democrats have only been successful and flipping one seat\nRed to blue in any of those competitive states in this entire decade and that's the Conor Lamb state and the special election in two thousand Seventeen\nSo when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no swing in any district in any of these competitive swing states you also see this as well at the state legislative level so you have all of these states\nThat are closely divided like say North Carolina\nI'm you know states in which that Democrats may often when more votes state wide for a chamber\nAnd yet here for example Republicans have a super majority in in both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override the actions of a democratic governor here at makes politics more extreme it inflates members\nFrom voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom build it wildly unpopular and yet the politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead\nAnd enact that kind of legislation um and it also discourages competition in a lot of these states in North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine percent\nOf all statewide seats went without a major party competitor so voters had no choice animals half of their districts here because folks\nGlad to get to some of your comments as well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of your fans on the show no one of our audience hottest hottest topics including with Michael who wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power there shouldn't be partisan\nMichael writes Ohio is heavily gerrymandered however in an election earlier this year voters heavily approved with support from both parties an issue on the ballots are fairly redrawn districts after twenty twenty\nAnd Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered the rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an active for this twenty Eighteen election ain't that a load of crap that's all the same in North Carolina Laura by the way we did a program a while back in February ... actually about gerrymandering\nWhere we put a quiz online we have some gerrymandered districts and we wanted to see if you could tell the difference\nBetween the map of gerrymandered district\nAnd an ink blot on a Rorschach test you can find that quiz if you search the word gerrymandering G. E. R. R. Y. M. A. N. D. E. R. I. N. G. it was a program that aired this February you'll find that on our website the one a dot Ford\nKatie let me come to you talk about voters not politicians I understand that this was a redistricting initiative that got started after you were trying to find some way to be politically active but not overtly hyper partisan and this is something that galvanized people around you right\nYeah I'm I accidentally started a political movement with a Facebook post it was after that too many sixteen election uh before\nI'm headed to a Thanksgiving dinner and I had heard my friends and family really are being drawn to both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders on what these messages about draining the swamp and the political resolution and\nI realized that you know there's a lot of frustration against the current system in place which makes a lot of sense I remember learning about\nGerrymandering and it does make it to that our voices aren't heard or that popular a proposals aren't being passed that the local level and we're lucky in Michigan where we have the citizen lead 'bout initiative process which means if we can write constitutional language as the people in Michigan and then

director of voters not politicians David daily senior fellow at fair vote and the author of the upcoming book is a rising and read Wilson national correspondent for the hill\nA couple of you wrote us to respond to lower his message about Pennsylvania's redrawn maps not being in place for this year's election mark writes that the new Pennsylvania congressional maps are effective this election cycle\nSteve writes the state Supreme Court had to intervene to get a fair districts\nSomewhere so badly gerrymandered districts formed pictures\nLook at the old seventh congressional district\nThankfully the new districts are enforced for twenty Eighteen in some of them say that the seventh congressional district in Pennsylvania looks like goofy and Donald Duck facing one another's seriously to Google it\nSpeaking of which Maurice tweeted gerrymandering has transcended the political realm and infiltrated the fashion world he sent us a link to a website called gerrymander jewelry dot com this is a thing\nGerrymandered jewelry has all these pictures six in fact of voting districts than North Carolina sixth district Texas is thirty fifth district's Louisiana six Florida force Michigan fourteenth\nAnd Ohio's first district and they're selling them as jewelry a hundred and Ninety five dollars each but the proceeds benefit of political action group is trying to get more ...\nStates we got a lot of comments read about the role of Republicans in gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current maps it's gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past\nThe ... election to stem their losses\nIsn't fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantaged but what what what do we know well the Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and how they were Democrats came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates\nBack in twenty Seventeen the way of Virginia elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered years so\nIt it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia a but but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which is sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives\nUh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the no party is blameless in this\nUh gerrymandering started we get the word from a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts\nUh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal and members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those still existed today\nOr to win all the districts around it uh the a newspaper down in in Boston\nTook a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander it was a gerrymander ...\nThat's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the beginning of the republic hum you could argue that some of this happened back in in a feeling and democracy back in you know the five hundred BC uh but when we talk about today\nBoth parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four\nAnd they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south that were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters\nAre and now even today we see some challenges to district lines drawn by Democrats especially in the state of Maryland uh there's one district or out in western Maryland they used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the lines and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes both parties do this Republicans have done it\nAbout a fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the lines aren't fair and therefore are are probably the ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish the fact that that these winds may not be fair right but the the people who who cry furnace tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils if you will\nWe do get comments from folks on both sides of the aisle complaining about how both sides of the aisle tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the geo peas going nuts in Colorado over ballot initiatives to read just require a nonpartisan commission\nSlow deep tweeted I Wish this was such a hot topic back when Democrats in my state had districts in the shape of a pencil\nJoanne wrote on our Facebook page redistricting reform has been an issue for several years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court was a majority appointed by Republican governors had approved by the Republican legislators\nNothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislative branch is controlled by one party several bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership than killed by Republican chairman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and see so publicly\nKatie face he I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political but not partisan can you give me a sense of some of the conversations you've had with folks that you've been witness to a folks kind of talking across the aisle about this does this feel\nPractically to you on the ground like a unifying issue\nYeah my experience really has been that um I mean in Michigan though we have had Democrats and Republicans control the line drawn process so maybe that helped but\nWe have volunteers or a Democrat to Republicans independents and I think that what we've seen is that no matter which party is in charge in Michigan they're really common sense things\nThat we all lead to government at at least help provide basic things like clean water or roads that aren't falling apart um those things aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know where is also a Detroit is pretty gerrymandered they try and pack a lot of Democrats into one district but there there are still Republicans do you live in those districts and said their voices aren't heard\nOr because a lot of these races are happening in the primary and we don't really have competitive elections at the statewide level in Michigan we are a lot of people talking about even if they're that us special that it there I'm represents\nIn Michigan in particular people have just had enough we feel like our government's doing a lot of overreach and want to help restore some transparency in the system especially for consistently ranked one of the least transparent states when it comes to transparency in government\nUm and that's the biggest thing we heard all you're doing those town hall with a lot of people saying you know I don't know why the lines are being drawn and then eight years later some emails coming coming out a talking directly about how the lines were drawn to guarantee one party an advantage or another\nAnd people are tired of it they want to be looked at as\nHaving our politicians accountable to us than not special interests um what's been really cool to is that you see a lot of families who have joined voters not politicians to volunteer together even for my family it did work\nI'm happy that Thanksgiving dinner or ... ... yeah yeah I've got five hundred signatures and its canvassing every day we got thirty days till the election so\nIt's been really exciting I mean you see a lot of people who are like you know there's nothing that we agree on but I really like working on this issue because\nThe basic concepts of fairness\nAnd an impartial system and a system that put that people first I think that there's some of our core democratic values that when you think about America you think about that and it resonates with people across the aisle and not always at the people who are right now in charge but the average voter we support across the aisle\nPoint three Clark's in Lewiston\nBrett Kavanaugh\nHow to those words feel\nHowever you feel you're probably feel strongly and you will

always minimize both our numbers and our positions as women\nJohn brought on our Facebook page you catch soft sell this anymore which unwavering support for Duncan Hunter junior Kavanaugh and Trump Republicans are OK with slandering and sexual assault\nThe only reason was Ford was not believed was because she was testifying against the Republican nominee the white didn't even listen to her and the FBI quote unquote investigation was a total sham and John ... investigation in quotation marks\nOn a chair and I didn't want to ask you about that in terms of\nWho was believed in this whole process set aside for a moment the evidence she or a question of whether the Senate should be thinking beyond a reasonable doubt like in court for more you know preponderance at like ... set that aside for for just a moment but just\nThe visceral way in which some people seemed to be more believed than others what did you make of that [noise]\nSo this episode like so much and are highly highly polarized society\nIs two completely different world views so when Democrats um both partisan Democrats any way I look at what happens with Kavanaugh they see a Republican Party that is ... that doesn't believe women that diminishes charges\nA sexual assault doesn't take them seriously\nAnd um they have some things in their in their quiver they can point to the Roy Moore episode and a and to the president himself and so forth so\nThat's their view on the Republican view is that the allegation of Christine Blasey Ford was even though it was held until the very last moment and they're they're very angry about the the process as um\nTaken seriously was listening to but then it was roped in\nBy many Democrats on the committee with two other allegations that were so absurd that they should not have even pass the laugh test I'm the one by Julie sweat neck which she immediately walked back you know that that there was some sort of rape gang going on in a in in ... says to Maryland and the Nineteen eighties and to\nThe students and that she has a college student was attending a lot of high school parties and saw Kavanaugh spiking the drinks are girls with clay lose and then attacking them well of course she she walked all of that back but\nUh and of course the Ramirez story too was quite thin so thin that the New York times looked into it and we refuse to publish it [noise]\nSo um [noise] so so the the problem was that when Michael ...\nSort of collard sweat neck and dragged her forward and included her absurd allegations in with blazing Ford's more um believable accusation it had the paradoxical effect of ... of um making sleazy Ford's case all the um weaker\nBecause it was seen to be part of this political hit\nAnd um and I think of an ... ah may have a lot to answer for from his a democratic colleagues\nWill the president did also make some political have with Christine Blasey Ford's case or her story as well when he was part of what you said at a rally on Wednesday in Mississippi in an act of what he said was to help defend Brett Kavanaugh and he's unfair treatment here's a bit of the president\nKind of characterizing washing cars are generous word what professor Ford said two Senate\nDid he get home I don't remember how did you get hurt on remember when it was the place I don't remember how many don't want to [noise]\n\nWhat\n[noise] I'm Wondering why I don't know [noise]\nI don't\nMind my tattered a man lives shattered\nPart of what the president's senators rally last Wednesday in Mississippi it's worth noting that the president is incorrect in his assertion that all the professor for to remember was having one beer indeed she said that seared into ... clearly a psychology professor was the fact that she was laughed at\nGlory in that moment where he was mocking her and diminishing her of course a that was that was disgusting on the other hand\nUm there has been a tremendous amount of behavior on the left during this process that was also\nI'm really lemon trouble stopping people in restaurants and and driving a people are from the public square um uh you know accusing someone of a absurd charges and not taking into account his whole life you know\nUh if judge Kavanaugh where the monster that uh the some of the Democrats had been portraying you would think that somebody would have picked up on it at some point in his adult life\nWell and that's kind of what I'm Wondering in a way I hear you on that morning early on I also kind of noticed that\nOne aspect of the debate of brown Brett Kavanaugh to seem to not get a whole lot of mentioned in the final analysis didn't get a lot of mentioned from Susan Collins of Maine when she gave that like Fifteen minutes exploitation on the floor of the Senate which was actually rather fascinating toward hearing if you've ever heard it\nIs just how Brett Kavanaugh handled the accusation I mean if someone accused me of something got awful that I knew I did not do\nI think I Would hope that I'd be able to say listen this is an awful thing that happened it sounds like a tragedy I Wish I could give you the closure you're looking for but I'm not the person who did it like something about temperament in this whole discussion kind of fell by the wayside\nYeah I Do think that once the additional allegations came out in ... in his testimony had to answer not just for a lousy Ford's allegation but also for the other two allegations\nAnd and he was upset angry in tears enraged are\nOutraged on Democrats sort of their their arguments are became one not about necessarily guilt or innocence\nBut one about temperament and did he have the appropriate temperament sit on the bench and it\nAh their argument necessarily uh it it became one not about do we believe her but then he doesn't have a judicial temperament and Republicans answered in turn that are Democrats had said he was two blocks away and the Fox interview and to detach and then when he got angry they thought that wasn't good enough\nI'm from uh from\nUh the temperament question was interesting I'm not sure how relevant today is because we know all the politics of all the justices not really sure how cabinets temperament plays into\nIt with regards to temperament and civility Sam wrote on our Facebook page there's a difference between the Thomas and Kavanaugh hearings referring to Clarence Thomas back in Ninety One\nThomas required sixty votes to confirm Kavanaugh only fifty fifty plus one there's no need for civility for the majority anymore because there's no need to have at least some support\nFrom both sides you know what do you make a simple comments did not require sixty votes to confirm but she did not require six people\nNeeded not at we've never required sixty votes to confirm um ... it may have required sixty votes to proceed to develop a time Clarence Thomas did not get sixty votes\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the main office of

some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with you know step in and we ought to Johnson and motive Sharon ... let me let you jump in and responsibility on his comment before we keep going\nWell early on I mentioned that that Republicans I suffer in the midterms and that was a political sacrifice worth making I I actually think that the opposite I mean I'm not in that political prognostications business I think after twenty sixteen and that's a dangerous business you're\nAt but I don't think they'll suffer at all in fact I'm especially among Republican women there's been a big jumping enthusiast and there's a twelve point\nUpward swing among Republican women and that's because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women and for a lot of women\nAnd on and stuff a lot of blame moms who are are really scared about the standard that and know what I mentioned right the idea that a single accusation without any kind of corroborating evidence is enough to destroy a man's life I think there are a lot of women who see a problem with that standard as well and they are also energized ...\nThis is no doubt very very visceral for quite a lot of you including gene\nGene emailed urging contacted us in road we're more concerned with the men who were falsely accused two to five percent of the time\nThan the women who are raped Ninety five Ninety eight percent of the time\nWhen one in four women in America deal with rape and tens of thousands of rape kits remain untested there are bigger issues than your panel was talking about our justice system is broken the women on your panel or making my blood boils ... are we losing sight of something larger here [noise]\nUm well the um the problem of rape has always been with us as long as there's been human civilization\nStarted when I I hate to interrupt you but I just want to clarify something from the comment the comics who wrote that one and for women in America deal with rape Senator Dianne Feinstein and the shearing said that according to federal statistics it's one in ... the one in three women will deal with sexual violence it was a not race that that's way overstated sexual violence of sexual\nSo and that's a very very broad description drunk lose even just being funneled over your clothes against their will so writer should be careful with them yeah go okay so yeah the number is is is a is not not right but look at the problem of of male sexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization\nAll civilized society seek to cope with it\nAnd it's also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute because in most cases there are only two people it happens in privacy there are no witnesses um it's very hard to show proof if there was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera\nSo it is you know when people say well we're not being believed it's because it's it's very hard to prove and also we have to recognize that the consequences\nOf finding a guilt at finding someone guilty of rape I mean years and years and years in prison\nAnd so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it's it but I don't see any way around you know keeping in mind our standards of justice in fair play and see any way around the difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusation especially like\nRepresentative sample of the country but a preponderance of the woman who commented on this program have essentially said I don't want to hear it\nWe've been waiting for all of human history for our society to deal with the fact that men can treat women like pieces of meat and get away with it with impunity that day is over yesterday so fix this or we will shut you down until you do\nI hear you Mona but it's that emotional visceral part of politics earlier and I I don't think that the political will is there especially among women who have been assaulted to say okay I'll take a breath and wait another term for this to get better [noise]\nWell I think there are two challenges the first is that we have a justice system based on a presumption of innocence and the cabinet confirmation presented another challenge which is that he was not being tried in the court of law and the question raised and it was should he a\nBenefit from the presumption of innocence and we had a lot of senators saying no he should have the presumption of guilt and he should have to clear his name and not seem not to go over a well there was a political backlash on the right to that\nAnd so I think that there certainly is energy on the left but it is met with equal force from energy on the right with people who feel that that's\nGreatly unfair but the cabinet confirmation in saying that\nA ... a presumption of guilt when an accusation is leveled was sort of met with an equal and opposite energy from the right and emailers and callers can say that that makes their blood boil but covering this as a reporter that is simply a sort of what we saw\nI Do want to move on and talk about the impact on the Supreme Court but I should note that this has left some of you just regardless of your politics feeling very cynical about the process over all I mean this was very high political theater in some ways when you get down to it and that was kind of the reflection of one listener who just left a note in our inbox\nMy name is far I'm calling from Cleveland, Ohio I'm very disappointed\nIn our congressman and I'm very disappointed with the United states at this time being an African American woman I really do feel that it was all up the joke that they went behind doors and said okay let's skip the country of good show they already know what\nThey were going to do is not a government are the people on Oh yes it is\nFor this leads to a few more comments as we continue Tina in Grand Rapids Michigan emailed\nI'm so sick and tired of people talking about Kavanaugh's reputation in life being ruined but it's absolutely ridiculous usually wealthy privileged white man whose life is nowhere near ruined obviously now he's been confirmed and will be on the Supreme Court her life is the one that has been ruined if anyone's life has been ruined\nThe me too movement has not been weaponized for political gain and I'm Upset that your guest just said that on the air so angry right now this is real for women\nIrwin in Arkansas emailed so we'll Kevin are really take the court to the far right I've been hearing conflicting views from the right where some say she will do so and others say Kavanaugh will actually be moderate ... gets to something that senator Collins of Maine Susan Collins of Maine\nTalked about in her long exploitation explaining why she was going to vote\nFor Brett Kavanaugh and some of his background particularly as it relates to dealing with presidents on the Supreme Court she mentioned roe versus Wade very specifically what what's your read on whether or not Brett Kavanaugh will track record kind of as Irwin suggested to the far right\nLook on because he's replacing Anthony Kennedy I think there will be a shift the right on the court um I think it will be much more measured than some are claiming\nI'm I think it's really unlikely that used the roe versus Wade something like overturned precedent overturn I think it's much more likely that we see some narrowing at the precedent on abortion allowing states I'm a little bit more leeway to regulate abortion and the second and third trimester is I think that's more likely outcome on those issues\nUm I Do think that Susan Collins overstated a Kavanaugh's moderate credentials a little bit and her her speech um because he was asked the judge and they ... he was following Supreme Court\nPrecedent his job as a judge would try to guess how its Supreme Court would rule on a particular issue given the process that now that he is setting that President needs crater on what he thinks\nThat President should be um I I Do think something that's under covered we we may now have I don't think that we have the votes on the Supreme Court to overturn roe versus Wade I Do think that we had the votes on the court potentially can narrow something called a Chevron precedent", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Pullman", "day":
