A. M. U. dot org let's get back to that story of the Saudi Arabian journalist ... who has gone missing possibly murdered\n... we've heard a number of accounts particularly from the Turks about what Saudi Arabia allegedly did to Mr to show you that they basically sent hitman after him what do we know for sure about the disappearance at this point\nFor sure we know that he walked into the come to a in Istanbul and he didn't work out\nThat is what we know for sure that all then reports that there were two Gulf Stream jets that came from Saudi Arabia or we fifty men of they they go see it into a black out a finds a drive to the ... so the consul general's residence which is allegedly where show he may have been taken\nAnd they did what they did to him now there are reports that creating that\nAre ... intelligence have proof or that or that they know what happened to him and that he was tortured and dismembered and I met the most brutal brutal death under the fifty men then flew back to Saudi Arabia on the Gulf Stream jets and little eight to ...\nTo assemble ... and then went back to Riyadh who was on them well that designation most within the state type of racist widowed one hundred percent no but you get the distinct sense that uh the ... the ... are telling the authorities here\nA ... you will thirties here in the U.S to understand is not a million miles from what I have just sketched out because I think that that has been a willingness to believe and that is why you're seeing\nThe deep expressions of anxiety and on these over what has unfolded I Know what the implications might be there are some things that you can easily sweep under the carpet in international affairs and there are some things that are just there are a bit more ... quit I miss definitely falls into that category\nWhere we I Wonder if we can talk about the U.S in Saudi Arabia is relationship there very long time allies at a press conference at the oval office yesterday President Trump was asked about to show you disappearance here's part of what the president's at\nFirst I Want to find out what happened and what located again this took place in Turkey\nAnd to the best of our knowledge\nBecause she'll be is not a United States citizen is that right or for a permanent resident okay we don't like John we'd all like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten million dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have\nFour or five alternatives to very good alternatives\nThat would not be acceptable to say OK but we're looking for the answer and I think probably you'll have an answer sooner than people think\nThe president speaking at the oval office yesterday and relieves referring to invade human Saudi Arabia and the four or five alternatives would be other countries from whom the Saudis could buy arms the hundred and ten billion dollars is an arms deal a military deal between the U.S\nAnd Saudi Arabia I Wonder if you could give us a sense of how this case fits into the relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia especially in light of a comment that I read earlier a re read at chess sixteen forty three wrote on our website the one eight dot org\nAnd there is no reason to maintain close ties with a country that the heads more people than ISIS\nFinally gives women the right to drive but it's only window dressing is killing civilians in Yemen and murdered a journalist who was critical of the quote unquote royal family if I were king for a day all the weapons we sold them would be rendered useless and Jared Kushner would be banned from any policy making law\nIt's a really a fascinating point and also that that um clip you played of Donald Trump was really striking because I'm the one hand\nIt seemed so I'm cold lead transactional in the sense that he was saying you know we have billions of dollars pouring in why am I going to stop that just because they have murdered a dissident journalist in other words I I'm so you know I don't care about human rights I mean we usually stand up for I care about money pouring into the United states economy\nAnd that attitude had activated a lot of\nUm people in Washington who are against our alliance with Saudi Arabia for example senators on both sides of the aisle Chris Murphy and Rand Paul Krugman arguing for a long time just as the commenter said\nUm that we're supporting the war in Yemen that it's unconscionable that is starving civilians and killing civilians killing civilians and you know bus attacks and other things that are just horrendous um\nWhy the hell out of the country short but since you mentioned Rand Paul I'm really sorry to interrupt you but we have a clip of Rand Paul speaking to reporter this week on that very thing he said he would try to force a vote on us arms sales to Saudi Arabia I'll let you finish your thought but first let's hear from Senator Paul\nI think that the early reports have shown that this is linked to the Saudi Government and nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval so no I think that uh unless the unless hell of a sudden the journalists turns up alive\nI think that we should we should just continue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia plus I think we need to be voting in the Senate and debating whether or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was a Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead\nSo I was gonna say people like Rand Paul are going to push back against arms sales about about our support for the war in Yemen um even saw a at a law makers invoking the global Magnitsky Act which said that that the u._s. Trump ministries and have to investigate what happened and if they find Saudi officials responsible they need to impose sanctions all that being said I Want it is a counterpoint to the ... which is that\nOur relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been transactional Trump kind of said the quiet part out loud a little bit in the way he and the way he framed it out yesterday because we have never had a relationship an alliance based on value since World War two it had all been about money and oil think about nine eleven Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia\nThat didn't lead to a permanent rupture in our alliance because we have always seen them as a strategic ally not at the values faith allies in Europe and I think that's important to keep in mind that Trump said it and it particularly accentuated way and he feels you know is very transactional way past presidents have but it's been somewhat reflective\nOf what us presidents have sat quietly for a long time you know if I could chip in\nSo I did ... could moments in relationship to have with regimes that are far from perfect I mean I remember when Tony Blair was prime minister\nAnd there was a huge arms deal that was about to be concluded and the British serious fruit else's launched an investigation into what Saudi Arabia or had been doing whether they'd be paying kickbacks or whatever to get contracts through\nI'm old and you know it was clear that Saudis who said ... you've got to call this the cooled off the dog's otherwise the deal is in jeopardy and highly unusually massively controversial Leigh Tony Blair intervened with a ... an independent investigation and said right we're canceling this investigation\nAnd he used his power as prime minister because he felt he had to because Saudi Arabia was to the customer too important an ally\nAnd you've seen with Donald Trump you know one of the first place if he went to when he became president was to Saudi Arabia I traveled with him on that trip and it was they were one hundred percent in with Mohammed bin Salman now whether that regretting that or not it's an open question\nHowever they they are there are they an Donald Trump is determined that the arms deal will go ahead [noise]\nJust before we keep going and oh I was just going to\nSay if I could just add one thing that struck me as what the president didn't say he didn't mention Iran and he didn't mention the peace down as you recall last month at the un\nAt the United states has pretty aggressive and calling around the biggest threat to the region and by extension it was seen Saudi Arabia is that stopgap against possible Iranian expansion\nAcross the middle east on and of course on how to maybe it would be key to any sort of a peace deal so I think it's interesting that I'm a month ago we were talking about policies and going against Iran and so going forward how much will the U.S\nFocus on Iran and stopping an Iranian expansion on shape it's reaction or lack there of um to to what happened in Saudi Arabia and if it if and in fact is the case that they have killed a journalist inside they're constantly who is it a resident of the United states\nOf journalists who have been killed there was another journalist\nBeing remembered today in Bulgaria at a funeral the body of thirty year old TV host Victoria marine over was found over the weekend you're the Dan River in northern Bulgarian town she had been raped\n[noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from bona with the bona certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractor is committed to expertise and customer service contractor low cater and more information or at bona dot com [noise]\nFrom capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking account that can be open from anywhere capital one what's in your wallet capital one NA\nAnd from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nBack now to the friday news roundup with John\nA at W. A. M. U. dot org\nThe story of the next president of Interpol Ming hung way was reported missing last week by his wife that stories moved Maine was detained by Chinese authorities on corruption charges\nHe resigned in immediate effect this week\nThe arrest as part of a larger official anti corruption campaign by China's president Xi Jinping no grief among the ex Interpol president's wife is speaking out she told the Associated Press\nThat she felt threatened nephews have do we have a sense that you know of why this was going on and what it is that makes me so important to the Chinese government of what this means in a larger sense well\nHe's been a long time operative of the the Chinese government and their arguments being made that this is part of an effort to purge non loyalists to that she government and so there's no definitive answer but I think the message that um many are taken as it is somebody who's been in government this long and the police capacity\nUm could be sweat swept off the streets and his wife sent a knife ... the day the day he disappears that no one in China's safe and and at the time of all this there was talk from party officials about the importance of absolute loyalty said their suggestions certainly is that somehow\nHe was less than a mile and the eyes of the government\nI Will say I think I'm One of the more interesting developments as well as his wife and how outspoken she has been she has been she's in French protective custody\nBut she's been speaking out in a way that we wouldn't normally see out of China and I thought it was an interesting development and may have led to more information coming out quicker than Chinese officials wanted to happen\nAnd so it was fascinating to watch her sort of use 'em up public platform in a way we'd see more often in the west as a way to get information about her husband and defend her husband it's it's something we don't normally say\nWas heading out to Brazil were far right presidential candidate John ... surprised the nation when he shot to the top of the rings he nearly took the elections with forty six percent of the vote just shy of preventing a runoff Brazilians will vote in the runoff election soon on October twenty eighth\nGory Freidman can you remind us who are both in our own is and what makes him and his policy platform so newsworthy\nHe's a fascinating character he'd been he's a former army captain has been a Congress for almost three decades um\nHe's a law and order candidate that his his big thing so he said you know our crime rates are too high we need to\nUm shoot to kill 'em and and also to lose in gun laws to address crime rates he's also very controversial in the sense that he said things that are most optimistic\nUm that are anti algae it'd be the um and one other thing that's really important in Brazil we often forget I'm only became a democracy in Nineteen eighty five it will return to democracy Nineteen eighty five for Twenty one years ahead of dictatorship and he had spoken ...\nUm about the time of the dictatorship is a time when there was law and order one other point to know is that he had an armored but Donald Trump a lot of conservatives feel that Donald Trump has the right formula it'd be pro business you know loosen regulations ah you know be nationalistic\nAnd be about cracking down on crime and he has promised me a really close ally of the United states all of this is\nI'm very a shocking because Brazil for many ... for decades has been led by a leftist government or there was a little more ambivalent about his relationship with the United states and certainly a didn't espouse kind of the right wing views\nThat he had spouses so this is a real shock to the system I think it really goes to the fact\nThat Brazil I mean in deep recession it's embroiled in a massive corruption\nUm crisis or that affected all parties except for both narrow who is actually not been implicated in this and that was his that was hit a winning point I'll say one other thing we you know the Atlantic write an article in which they interviewed\nA a cab driver who said you know things are so bad maybe we need someone with crazy ideas out who else is going to fix this mat and so I think that that is that is the sentiment that is worth keeping an eye on because that was a similar sentiment\nAnd ... and Donald Trump's victory in the victory of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to Mexico I mean this is a sentiment that people are feeling against the establishment in many countries in the world\nBut to hear from some Brazilians who are listening in today and looking ahead to the election one listener emailed I'm and I'm a Brazilian listening from me sitting next to Brazil's capital Brasilia\nI'm very concerned about the future of our democracy the candidate leading the polls is an ex military who has a very anti democratic discourse which is also racist massages and homophobic since last Sunday the election day more than fifty people have suffered physical and brutal aggressions from both so NATO supporters\nSocial media specifically what's app\nIs playing a very important role and lots of fake news is circulating I really believe that with ... out of our democracy is at risk John ... is projected to happen for the runoff is there any sense of whether ... NATO could witness for the last poll I saw suggested yet that the latest post suggests that he is at fifty eight percent\nI kinda think that you'd have to say that if it to do with that sort of margin of error is going to take some quite something for the left is kind of kinds of it to come back from that position\nUm I mean you know they talk about violence and the other thing about both or not he was stabbed in September as a rally I'm sure there's been a lot of violence around but it has meant that he's been able to say I really love to take part in debates got really count at the moment because I'm Still you know slightly getting stopping that I had things that\nI'm afraid I wouldn't be able to come to your studio this evening on so I think that there is kind of a feeling that you know he is he's got his head down he has said what he said people know exactly where he stands and I think he sees the finish line\nOne story that much of the world has been talking about has to do with a new report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the IPC see the report says that the world is quickly running out of time to stem catastrophic climate change\nScientists predict we're on course to go beyond a crucial threshold of the world's average temperature rising one point five degrees Celsius or to point seven degrees Fahrenheit in just over about ten years they saved that would leave us dealing with the risks of extreme drought wildfires floods food shortages for hundreds of millions of people\nWe talked about this report on the program this week one comment from a listener stuck along the lines that at least here in America\nIs just not a big enough issue I mean people will vote for a lot of reasons and the state of our climate is not something that lawmakers talk much about or that voters demand to discuss Mitt to use if what is your sense of that or whether or not this report has made an impact around the world enough for people to start demanding action\nI think it's made an impact but the problem is the effect said that's already been seeing in various ways around the world where one country can say it's not\nA big impact another country could see it as an immediate impact on something that needs to be dealt with aggressively in of course the kinds of changes that this report says need to happen are so I'm drastic that it demands sort of a uniform world agreed upon action and we're not\nThere yet and so I'm ... years scene of variance and respond and I think it really reflects the variants have impact that nations are already seen\nAny either at work correspondent and one of the things I see it come up most often as a cause of the start of wars and conflicts environmental changes changing where people live how they're able to eat so I'm ... ... ... it's an ...\nThe and government writ large but there's because of the complexity in terms of its impact\nI think it's hard to get a uniform agreement particularly at it in such a polarized time um so it's hard to be optimistic that that will see at least in the short term the kinds of drastic changes at this report says needs to happen to stop literally famine drought wildfires really severe consequences\nJust sure I was in Europe at the beginning of the week\nAnd when the report came out and I on the main national news shows a half an hour long so the same as the nightly news programs here\nThe the first six seven minutes with devoted to decide PCC report I Wonder how much was devoted I mean there's one of the things that really strikes me about living here ... in America where you get more whether I think the square inch than any other kind of country on the planet\nAt you because huge amount about whether the climate is not discussed\nIs one of the things that really strikes me whereas I think in Europe there's a much greater consciousness whether they're doing that much about it is another issue but I think that you know I Am struck by how a lift all this ... the national debate a competitor in other parts of the world\nAnd judge said one thing that I spoke with the un secretary general Antonio ... recently right before the U.N General assembly and ask them what is the greatest threat you face right now what is your biggest challenge I expected him say a voting and disruption with the United states or the conflict in Syria\nThree ...\nI'm going to be talking about the latest firestorm in Washington but this week a real storm hurricane Michael cause catastrophic damage and what's next with a recovering\nFrom W.

T. I. P. C. C. set forth\nIt's kind of crazy until you do it really and telephone very serious about doing it\nAt the very serious about doing it um you know Paul Romer talks about\nThe problem isn't going to be solved until you build consensus 'em and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political will not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada same thing there you have prime minister Justin Trudeau trying to in a\nAnd pose a a carbon tax across the country and he's running into a real opposition at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment more comments on this not my autonomy tweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change\nA good point I might have caught him and I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not question the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying [noise]\nLeary tweeted it's frustrating because your criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck this storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand\nI disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you heart in your home and if you want to live in Florida but if he will risk of living was in charge of a rising coastline if you want to live there you just have to absorb that on the other hand I totally hear what\nBack from the coastline for safety sake the town could incorporate uh it's it's it's a tough one [noise]\nNobody's really tough and when we're we're when we're thinking about climate change in the sort of thirty to forty year our Todd and I were just talking about the strength to break\n'em there are ... risks that are opposed not just to\nA community is close to the coastline to where we are talking about today but large cities you know like Miami in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about survive ability about resilience or whether people want to continue living there\nAnd there is an element of risk that you take that also has to give people some agency and what I think is missing from the conversation about climate change\nIs a real honest discussion about long term risk and what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... ... one small point just to and if you think that risk and getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about\nUh Americans also need to think about what some of our international leaders leaders generals like Colin Powell advisers had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nUh and conflict means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they started to migrate when they upset the relationships between countries and that becomes not just their problem in terms of life and death but America's problem in terms of of keeping the world in order\nWill listen for those who are in an had been in the path of hurricane Michael we wish you of course a speedy recovery and we'd\nLove to hear from you as you continue to deal with the recovery give us a sense of how you doing how the recovery is going what your thoughts are and how things are going how well FEMA is meeting your needs\nState officials how well that's going we always love to hear from you feel free to email us one a at W.

A. M. U. dot org Todd's will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nThe Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump is using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them\nSeem determined not to let the Kavanaugh's confirmation go\nIt seems to have had the opposite effect certainly so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put to provide so around what I'm about to say uh that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterms we will know in four weeks however it looks like now is having an opposite effect on Senate races\nAnd house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging the Republican and a red state\nActually had a a chance of either surviving or in the case of Tennessee uh maybe picking up an open seat to now a search for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh\nHis behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously in house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that has had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them\nUp but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion or you know lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in\nFront of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college uh I Would look to the house\nMost likely house members who may\nIf the numbers hold true control the house after January the will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships and like and like Shane said before they will become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base that wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this\nJoshua ... comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of that FBI background\nCheck that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile highly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee or the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up that church ...\nI'll add to this you know senator ... Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee where she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the chance can grill\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on that face to face on how much intervention did the White House do an essay supplemental background check\nWill click also and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up she's up for reelection even that that this is going to come up in that debate between her and state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd last thing I'll say it she just last night um\nThey're trying to remake the court to rent large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California ... this is a court that's been a real story and trying to fight the White House just put forces three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on she's very upset about that and try and\nAt ... really breaking French tradition by not giving in the home state senators any fanny packs\nI Do want to see if we can leave time to talk California politics before the round up is up but a few more things out of D.C we wanted to discuss including the president stepping into the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and Kanye West he publicly this miss swift\nFor endorsing two Democrats in Tennessee and he woke up Kanye West of the White House yesterday Connie wore red make America great again hats for the visit\nAnd we're gonna have lunch with the thought of but I don't want to say I don't want to put you in this by by love this guy let me get this\nNow calling us was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like Saturday Night live make the president look bad he said the president needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear those Shane Harris Kanye seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he noted\nThat he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of easy to criticize but the fact that he said\nThat he is bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity at the other side of the resolute desk\nI I'm not sure what to do with it\nI I'm not either I mean I think it was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on other ... arguably more important stories that I hesitated into the deep end this like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of said is this is this really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it but it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre\nCarnival esque spectacles that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of a when he ran\n... the office of the president to see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make it a behavior\nFrom a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that says right but there's also left many people scratching has had about what is he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him a it was just a very strange moment then I Know for\nFor for for me and my heart just tried to move past it as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest in moving past as quickly as we could still do that too but I should note the county's old nemesis Taylor Swift inserted herself into politics this week\nShe endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media and the Senate race in Tennessee is tight and British and has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram and voter registrations among young people rose by more than sixty thousand\nAfter her post\nShane Harris let me speak with you for a moment because President Trump is facing another difficult situation regarding the disappearance of a journalist named ... Saudi dissident and a resident of the U.S he disappeared inside the Saudi consulate\nIn Turkey you've been doing a fair bit of reporting on this particularly the concern that the Turks have raised that the Saudis basically saying hit men to kill ... to show you because of his reporting\nThe Turkish government hasn't really provided any independent evidence for this they say they have security video and and logs of people who signed in and so forth what do we actually know right now if anything about what really happened\nRight well you know right now is largely coming from the Turks and Turkish security agencies\nAre what we reported last night my colleagues and I and the Post's late last night was that the Turks have told the Americans that they actually have audio recordings and video from inside the consulate that they say definitively prove ... who was an opinion writer for the post Washington Post\nA was a beaten and tortured and killed and ultimately dismembered inside\nThat facility um the Americans and we understand have not seen the footage or hurt it themselves but there's a growing belief within the U.S intelligence community and I think within Congress in the White House ah that the Saudis probably did kill Jamal ... and are not at all being forthcoming about that this is a politically\nDifficult situation for this president in particular because the White House is so close to uh the the regime in ...\nAnd so I'm On the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and I broke a story earlier this week that before ... he went missing been so mine had actually ordered an operation to trying to lure him back", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Pullman", "day": "12"}
