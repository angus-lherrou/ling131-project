book accessory to war the unspoken alliance between astrophysics and the military coauthored was obvious Lange a research associate at hate him and he joins us now from New York Neil DeGrasse Tyson welcome to what I\nDo thanks for having me and even pronounce my co authors name correctly she's obviously going fantastic or you have very good credit to our producer Amanda Williams forgetting the answer right we like getting the facts on this program and we'd like to get you some of the facts about really smacks yeah if you care about facts and it seems on cornered the market leafing you'll just stayed with it\nAnd go for you know and if you'd like to get some of the facts about space and science for astrophysics and its relationship to the military now is a good time comments on our Facebook page tweet us at when a or email one a at W. H. M. U. dot ... let me start\nWith the book this alliance between astrophysics and the military give us a sense of what that is in a nutshell and why it is as the title of your book suggest\nSo unspoken yeah so\nHearing you know somebody had to invent the catapult when that was first showed up on the battlefield what an asymmetric weapon that would have been a symmetric in the military sense where your opponent has something that you don't have and you're in deep trouble because of that difference\nAnd so that they call it an asymmetric advantage so engineers definitely and if you look at the new book of of Leonardo da Vinci where yeah he did art but he also was a master mind that sort of military machines that could lay waste to your army\nSo and we know him as one of the greatest combinations of scientists engineer and an artist\nBut moving forward you think of the physicist as a person who built the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know that can is you know wouldn't make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they were you know flood the field with mustard gas\nAt the biologist might weaponize anthrax for example the astrophysicist ... ... you may know such association because we just humbly sit at mountaintops and wait for photons to arrive from across the galaxy\nAnd then we carefully takes a detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw\nSo that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics in the military it just never shows up but in fact astrophysicist and in the earlier days astronomers have been fundamental to the growth of empires and the Gemini of nations\nIn particular the the need to navigate with precision around the world ... my my professional ancestors no new the night sky\nAnd to to know the night sky and on any level is to give you better advantage for navigating earth's surface\nBecause the sky what's different depending on where you are on earth and things rise at different times and sat in different places\nAnd so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where we're the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established and there's no end of examples where this kind of information was exploited for the game of the nation who had control\nOver it I should know we did have a conversation on this program for those who are more interested in this connection between science and the military about the origins of chemical weapons during World War one that did that heritage traces right back here to American University\nOne a dot org new President Trump announced the creation of a space forced this summer a six to branch of the military to focus on the militarization of space I guess it will be a fifth plant since the coast guard is technically part of the chess which is also the topic of your book\nGive us a sense of his money off it within there is a topic of the book give us a sense of what the space force would need to do have accomplish avoid to be in the best interest of the American people in of humanity\nFirst of all just to to the space forces not a new concept and ah it it surely been around even before I remembered mentioning it in two thousand and one in a commission I served on\nA authorized by the White House to study the future of the u._s. aerospace industry which at the time\nWas had fallen they've fallen on hard times I lost a half a million jobs that his consolidation in the industry there's competition from Europe with Airbus\nAnd other places that were rising up like in Brazil has embraced Air Canada was making a regional jets so there was a concern that well what happens if we lose this industry\nTo what impact would that have on our security on our transportation on our commerce\nYou order something from Amazon is on your steps the next morning some airplane delivered it they're\nRight or at least to the nearest airport [laughter] step doorstep delivery by a airborne craft is still to come but\nWe would call them drones I guess [laughter] but so so you you ... when you look at this problem you say All right uh what are you going to do about it and I said well might we separate the concerns of the air with the concerns or space 'cause these are the same companies\nAerospace companies that that became a word right and if you separated out in the military you would then sort of tidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm at the time on this commission there was a four star air force general\nAnd the air force then and now controls space activities that the military it's called the U.S air force space command and they said we think we got this we don't really need a space where as separate from what's already happening so I was a dead at second guess general but I was intrigued by that confidence that he had\nFast forward to today on the Trump announcement as well as the pants follow on announcement\nLook how big my biceps is as I speak that was very we don't want to just be there and we went to we don't wanna just leave we want to dominate you know there's a lot of this kind of language and that spoke to many people typically sort of peace next out there who say oh my gosh what will just mean\nDo you think of that ad thing though I mean if the U.S has supremacy you had Gemini over space our aims you know as a western power might be a little more benevolent than say the aims of China or Russia or North Korea\nYeah sure I'm just saying one could have ... said exactly the same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear the future of what could happen if you quote militarized space as I was really represent rhetoric not reality reality is\nA space for us what would that mean you would just take all the space activities that are already happening under the air force and slide them out under one umbrella once with a coherent umbrella\nAnd if you're going to do that uh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense right why don't you you know put that in your portfolio while you're at it\nThat could be quite devastating to any place on earth where a bad asteroid strikes and then the limit it could render is only ... thanked as one did sixty five million years ago with the dinosaurs and Seventy percent of all\nSpecies of life on earth at the time and that asteroid was only six miles across an earth is huge relative to that it's a matter of the energetic and what it does to the climate and the atmosphere\nAnd the long term survivor ability right of of of the body odor that requires the sunlight to feed it so so space force\nWould might include ... by the way I Would also throw in on your clean up the debris it's up there while you're yes the space debris problems but so so here's the distinction I Want to make which ... which I don't I haven't seen the press or the public recognize\nSpace it's very hard and not particularly strategic\nTo make space and asked the repository of weaponry\nHolding aside the fact that that would violate a treaty to which we are signature today more than a hundred countries are son\nFrom Nineteen sixty seven that it's a peaceful use of outer space treaty has a much longer name that I always forget right those are those are the that those are the essence words from the title\nAnd it's very beautiful treat it you feel like holding hands and singing kumbaya should read it particularly at a time when there's the Cold War but space activities weren't right on the rise it was a ... a really beautiful\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station\nAnd from the three I O T powering enterprise digital transformation with artificial intelligence predictive analytics an audio chief illusions

S.\nAt least find a way to transplant the brain of an outsider as patient into the body of I'm Sorry the brain of an English Patient into the body of an Alzheimer's patient and they get a full person out of that because one you you lose the body other you lose your your mind\nIs that this sounds very altered carbon even watched a lot of Netflix Savage [laughter] very Frankenstein to ... I\nJust said if you had goals if you can't otherwise I I bet we'll find cures for both of those before we learn how to transplant of brain but I think\nAbout that all the time certainly helps them certainly hope so and wants to know do you believe in aliens that's not a\nMatter of belief is this there's no evidence for life on the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you you go to the ocean and you stick a class in and scoop out some water and they analyze what it really carefully insect\nThere no whales in the ocean [laughter]\nNo you haven't looked the arts so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy in our search for life\nAre intelligent life uh for example uh um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard or on Mars and perhaps other places but anyone who study the problem is\nIn no way doubts the strong likelihood that there's life elsewhere in the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with it\n[noise] Amy asked on our Facebook page will the human race cease to exist in the next thousand years based on the current environmental trends now considering a possible impact from an asteroid or other cosmic influence\n[noise] we're pretty sure that nothing extinction level is headed our way that would take us out in the next thousand years and we know that because the more dangerous and asteroid is the bigger it is typically and the bigger the easier it is to detect so\nOut of nowhere because comments very long period comments\nThey sort of show up you know you don't have history for them and one could come in and take us out or it would be really bad luck to you if that were the case but I mean regardless you want to help the space program that can deflect these things and so I'm all for\nBuilding you know protecting have any insurance plan that you put a little bit of money in for a to protect you against a devastating saying that it would be very rare\nSo but uh otherwise we could easily go a thousand years if we become wise shepherds of our power\nAnd over nature and we need the warnings are scientists\nI Wonder how what what the over under on that I tend to be\nFairly hopeful younger people seem to have a very different grasp of the value of the earth that this is the one home we have than many of their parents and and forebears and I kind of skill today's generation gives me hope for dealing with some of the problems are climate faces but what about you\nYeah I'm hopeful I'm realistically hopeful so but I'm ... I'm Sorry I'm [laughter]\nI'm cynically hopeful so here's how this works cynically hope yes so here so people don't act even when they're warned until it gets really bad and then they asked\nSo all these this topic movies that show like look at Blade Runner right the woman ever get to that point\nThis so this ... you know because we reach it or or orange soil like green no because you reach a point where people say no this is to this is this I cannot tolerate any further out to eat people I don't want to if\nPeople are so rich that bridge is too hot [laughter]\nRight right so you so you so we have restoring forces in the world\nThat prevent swing too low in in this regard and these this topic story telling 'em it involves a trend that never stops and goes to rock bottom and I've ... I've seen people bounce back societies bounce back ... people in power bounce back\nSo how long you're going to deny science until it really interferes with your health and your wealth then he said oh my gosh I think I like science again and then you put the funds back him so I that's why I think we'll be okay\nJared submitted questions through our app won a vox pop\nThink that human beings are physically incapable of understanding the fundamental nature of the universe\nMatter to question Jared\n... so I think about that all the time I'd lose sleep on whether it's slightly rephrase the question I lose sleep over whether the human mind is smart enough\nTo actually understand the universe as it is\nAnd I worry that we may not be smart enough to even what question to ask\nAnd this disturbs me because we know who defines humans as intelligent we do we do yeah who's to say that that is sufficient intelligence to figure out how the universe works\nSo so uh now dark matter dark energy the advantage to being modern human is that we can we can stand on the shoulders are those who came before us you don't have to invent calculus to solve the next problem somebody else did\nSo in a way we are assembling wrong by rung a ladder of knowledge that looks over every next wall that we have confronted and so we were so maybe the sum of all the intelligence of all humans\nWhich has provided by peer reviewed journals that are publicly available as we all start where someone left off and take it further that as we stand maybe we can be smarter as a species that we can as an individual\nOne point three Clark's in Lewiston\nWhen it comes to sexual harassment and assault America is having a moment victims mostly women are sharing their stories like never before in the nation was lifted\nFrom W AMU and NPR in Washington did do one [noise]\nNeither Joshua Johnson today on on a me too and your story set aside the politics of become a confirmation for a moment and you see something that may be even more transformative women are speaking out about being abused and for the first time being hurt and believe what impact might this outspokenness have\nAnd what should you do if someone shares their story would you\n... the head and we'd love to know how these conversations are going in your role I sure wouldn't even know about this Gulf and sexual assault female is what a act W.

to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us who are silently coping by the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you were more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids at a time when you're ready to discuss it in the family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words are the number one letter a dot org [noise]\nWhat's that another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board Mara welcome to the program thanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times an account of your salt and its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote\nI never felt compelled to share my story before because of this so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote\nAn unremarkable what made you think of what you had been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\nYou know for years and my friends and I have ten\nAnd colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of our sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through a similar experience as somewhere on that spectrum\nI just you know as a journalist who I never want to make it about me and so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring Dr ... testimony doubt um\nMy decision to to stay silent on my own experience\nCan you share with others to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think and we both had and been interested or another and\nWhen you drink a lot I was Twenty years old at the time um and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex\nAnd that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was a rougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to\n'em and it was very painful and I I'm asked him to stop and I think eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly and you know I think ... frankly was probably too drunk to kind of know what was going on is what what I thought at the time\nAnd you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but you know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so\nYou really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nNo last week professor Conan A democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor forward what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh having done to her as a teenager here is part of what professor Ford said\nIndelible in the hippocampus is the laughter ... laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun at my expense\nProfessor can you explain for us from a neurological perspective why it is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the hip\n... and um [noise] Dr Ford in her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's going to die or that he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has specific parts that are evolved to encode fear and if you just think about it I'm I'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous and I should I run away\nYou when people who can encode that ... that fear that lion and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on the brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes\nOr sound or the music or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that I'm even just hearing her talk about it really makes my heart clutch you know it's really emotional\nUm but forget other details like uh the house you were in or the neighborhood or the street\nThose aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is a brain operate\nIt kind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way he described it it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie or you know you walk in throwing in house you'll forget over the corps but that being that leaked out at you that kind of forced your adrenalin to rise bats wouldn't codes that great example yes\nNo more you said that a moment she's mia Lauren and Lauren Taylor these moments in code so intensely are there are ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or do you just kind of have to deal with some of those things kind of trigger those images that are super vivid how do you work through those or ten you\nThere are many many ways to work through those I'm\nTalking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or a community support group or an ... a an informal group of friends\nCan be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful um what we do in our empowerment self defense classes a is\nHelp people find their voice and find their physical power a talk therapy can accomplish a certain amount but I'm a professor Conan will tell you the trauma also lives in the cells of your body and um you need to have some kind of somatic\nWe we do role plays of practicing standing up for yourself or asking for what you want and we also do heading and um that can be that can really move the trauma through an out your body or not only reclaiming air power but you're also releasing whatever you've been through\nTo a few more of your stories Jennifer emailed my story involves a sexual predator who happened to be my boss ultimately I was raped on a business trip to get away I had to move to another state and begin my career again the cascade of consequences for each woman like me goes on for decades\nShe emailed I'm Seventy two I told my best friend about her employees who sexually harassed me she asked me to show him my breasts while he stroked himself\nAsked disgusting questions you did not tell in my day my friend she left my friend she's not my friend any longer\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering

and to keep up to date on future topics will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Lawrence Taylor of defend yourself New York times journalist Marvin Gaye and Harvard University's terrorists than Conan we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one more that came into\nName is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year that I was able to knowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years and it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why it doesn't matter that we were victims when we are raped we feel wrong\nEasy to pretend it never happened and emotionally it feels like the right thing to do because you're so scared at so hurt and so is shaped\nWe've thanks very much for sharing your story with us Laura good love to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment the comes\nAfter that incident like that for an attack like that\nWow and it's a powerful um\nYou know [laughter] so I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault or it was one of the things that many that that I dealt with but\nI have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nAnd you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before\nI was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown and social research or shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame need secrecy to survive I'm\nAnd of huge part of the reason that I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I you know I don't believe anymore\nOr that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame\nAnd so in telling my story you know I I was I feel huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that I'm into the public arena where I Believe that belongs 'em\nAnd no longer hold onto that I feel freer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend\nOr family member but hearing from them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it's knowing how many of the people I Love and care about and know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around\nAnd that uh I guess for me that's where\nWho I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experience as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching you know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of\nThe embodiment of that injustice and that's that's\nLearn I just wanted to um that speak to what this what lives shared about her experience there are very\nHonorable powerful reasons not to tell\nI Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone who feels unable to tell or who makes that choice not to tell 'em that it can be internal reasons like lives shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job\nUm but they are all very real at at the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\nWe have more control over our own experiences and how we shape them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\nSarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college where sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and he gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend\nOn top of me still inside me I never thought of him that way never consented and barely have the strength to get him off of me when I tried to tell some people what happened I was called a whore lucky because my rapist was apparently attractive to others\nAnd I was called a complainer\nAnd people wonder why survivors don't come forward\nPat emails when I was Thirteen Years old a podiatrist began molesting me he was thirty one he told my mom he had some work I could do for him if he checked patients in nursing homes he took me to pornographic movie theaters he taught me what a glory hole was\nHe had a friend of his implant an IUD in me this went on for almost two years [noise]\nMore and let me stick with you for just a moment I Would love to get your reaction to a clip from White House adviser Kellyanne Conway who spoke this weekend about her own experiences with being assaulted listen\nI feel very empathetic frankly for ... an actual assault sexual harassment and right\nNow [noise]\nI had so I don't think that since ... Kavanaugh and Jake Tapper Jeff Flake or ... to me how responsible for that we've gone through all ... own kind that\nThat was Kellyanne Conway speaking to Jake Tapper on ...\nSurvivor um you could feel the emotion in her voice ... it's a side of Kellyanne Conway we none of us have ever seen before um\n\nBut she seems to put the blame entirely on herself being responsible for your own conduct when we know that\nThe\nAggressor is the only person responsible for the harassment abuse or assault\nYou can for where anything you want you can get a strong because you want if there is not a rapist there you will not be raped I'm I'm Sorry that that she's carrying that and it's a really common thing that a lot of people carry\nCarlos wrote on our Facebook page I Am a fifty year old male survivor of sexual assault\nBy a man who was my mother's boyfriend at the time to this day and it's difficult for me to trust any man aside from my brothers because of this I rarely hug anyone and I'm ... extremely protective of my daughters professor Conan would you react to that I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of how\nThis might be playing out differently from meals survivors of trauma versus women who have been traumatized\nThank you for bringing that up because um [noise] one of the things we haven't talked much about is that men are also victims of sexual abuse and assault\nUm and that the effects on them I'm of developing anxiety phobia he TST are similar to that that women experience after being assaulted\nAnd I think for men who are victims of sexual assault if it's possible there's more stigma there's even more stigma in terms of being able to come out\nI'm and I'm the hurt 'em so I so in terms of how this is playing out I Wonder how men are feeling in terms of do they feel can identify with Dr Ford or would they feel like their experiences are being\nNeglected um I think if more men um\nWho were able to and felt comfortable speaking out that actually it'd be really helpful to the conversation you mentioned earlier about a men's involvement and I think people have mentioned hearing from ... Mel perpetrators but we also need to hear from our allies and met males to have had similar experiences I think that um", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "02"}
