I Wonder what your senses of what's going on in terms of places of worship\nBeing targets this isn't new of course we've had this attack in Pittsburgh there was a shooting at the church in Sutherland Springs Texas earlier this year there was of course the church shooting in Charleston South Carolina a few years of a few years ago\nWhat is it about places of worship to make them such targets\n[noise] well I think one thing Joshua is that places of worship segregate people according to their religion and to some extent according to their is from the city or race so\nIf you want to target Jews where would you go you go to a synagogue is going to be all Jews there if you want to target Muslims you can go to a mosque if you want to target black people and go to it a predominantly black church I mean so it's convenient in that sense you know in the in the sense that it allows the\nThe perpetrator to sort of zero in on the people that he wants to hurt\nIt's also really a challenge to their identity and if you really want to hurt those people go to their place of worship because that is obviously so central to who they are\nKind of an easy collection of targets kind of concentrated by what you want to target and also a soft target in the in the true sense\nYes exactly soft target you know\nI remember and I'm sure you do to going to church as a kid I mean there was a sense\nI'm not just as a kid for him or her any age once you enter the building people go to church and not just for the sermons not just for the for the ... because\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the

after last weekend's mass shooting in Pittsburgh and it's a question on the mind of the Reverend Adam Hamilton he's founding pastor of the nation's largest Methodist Church\nBack in Nineteen Ninety he founded the church of the resurrection in Lee would Kansas suburb of Kansas City the goal was to attract what he calls thinking Christians with little or no engagement in their faith\nToday it has more than twenty thousand members across four campuses it's considered one of the most influential mega churches in the nation\nPastor Hamilton says that he has observed deep division\nThinking differently we discussed it this summer when we were both in Aspen, Colorado for this year's Aspen Ideas festival here's the first part of our conversation Joshua what's great to be with you today thank you describe your congregation United Methodist church of the resurrection in league with Kansas or tell us about your country can sure\nWill he would have the suburb of Kansas City we've got four campuses throughout Kansas city's downtown Kansas City Missouri was rinse Missouri in a couple in the Kansas on\nAnd it's a very diverse congregation so highly educated largely a highly educated we have um we did a poll not long ago we found out that forty nine point two five percent of our people are Republicans and fifty point seven five percent of our people are divided between independents and Democrats\nThe Republicans were divided between conservatives and ... you know conservatives on social issues and those were moderate progressive on social issues but conservative fiscally\nBut Democrats are largely moderate to a progressive and the independents are divided between Republican leaning independents and democratic leaning independents are we ever were pretty divided congregation and I think we represent the country you know fairly well they're kind of divided within divisions of the holidays exactly that's exactly right and so it's an interesting thing when you come you know you have to as a religious leader\nSpeak about the issues that are happening in the world you know I'd I constantly have not constantly but I regularly get emails from folks saying well you know you're being too political I Wish you and talk about politics and\nAnd I have to say okay wait a minute I'm not standing endorsing candidates I'm not even talking about the candidates\nBut what you're calling politics I'm calling ethics and morals and values\nWhen we're talking about justice issues we're talking about people who are being hurt\nWe're talking about moral issues we're talking about in and so if you think about what forms or politics what is it is it just thirty second soundbites on you know in radio spots or TV spots for a campaign or is it a deeper sense of spirituality in a deeper sense of the meaning of life and why we're here and and surely I pray that\nWhen you're doing your politics\nYou're doing that through the lens of a deeper moral system in a value system\nHow much do you as a as a pastor is a minister lean into the political debates\nAnd a religious lens on them as opposed to trying to have times where you may be lean away from them like I imagine there are some weeks where you think let's just do a sermon on you know tithing earlier I just do a sermon on actually the story of the garden of eat anything but politics\nSo here's a so for the folks who are upset by it they feel like I'm doing all the time but here's the way I Try to look at it is um if I were reacting to the news stories every week\nWould be rewriting my sermon every ... every Saturday based on what happened in the news that week and then probably Sunday Morning ten and again probably Seventy morning and so what I've said it and that's not how I'm going to do this I outlined my sermons a year in advance you know actually I have ideas for two years in advance and yet somewhere in the midst of those is preaching on these teams the things that are happening in the news are going to come into play\nBut my ... isn't that a I mean I I think\nPeople are hearing so much news all the time and so much political rhetoric and so much divisiveness that when they come to a church I'm not sure they always need one more year round of what they're already getting every day\nSo what I'm trying to do is is carefully choosing where one of the moments when I Need to say something this is this has to you know something has to be said when there's a school shooting\nAnd even then there are so many school shootings I'd be preaching about school shootings too you know or violence in\nIn our society so I said we're going to talk about that a couple of times this year but I'm not going to talk about it every Sunday I Try to build into the ... into the year at least one sermon series is going to be focused on Christian ethics the entire series we're going to look at one of the issues that were that are dividing us or what are the issues we're facing in our society and then we're going to take a look and see how\nYou know for it to be a sermon and not just a an ethical lick electron ethics we're gonna look to see how the scripture speak into this how does our faith shape our response to these things and when I Try to do the pressure I tried to take us to say okay\nI Know we are divided about these things I'm I'm gonna try to help you see things through the eyes of the other and so we are going to try to understand what might be the truth in this complex moral issue but this one side has\nWhat does this side of bringing to the tables were having this conversation and I'm going to say now you know with all the humility I can muster you can disagree with me but this is how I see this issue right now I could be wrong but as I say this issue right now [noise]\nGun guns is a is a great example of this and a recently purchased sermon on gun violence in schools I did a sermon on a on gun control and and gun legislation that a year ago [noise]\nAnd as I did that you know I surveyed the congregation and laid out some basic common sense kind of measures that one can take to um to address the prevalence of guns and how easy access to them and\nAnd it was interesting how how many people agreed on both the left and the right on some of these basic things now that sounds like potentially risky ground because they begin to get out of spirituality and actual policy yeah uh it does actually so it's so here we're talking about what would what would we as people of faith how how might we respond\nTo you know the issues of shootings\nSo and obviously there's no guns in the Bible but there are swords and spears so he got plenty plenty of places where we talk about how do we respond to people who are our enemies we've got Jesus saying love your enemies we've got Paul talking about you know doing good to those that would harm you you know you've got a lot of things you could [noise]\nSo so there's a part of that that's going to be about those basic biblical principles but then there's going to be another person that's going to say so are there any solutions and is there any way that we as people face on the left in the right can come together to find some solutions and in the end we found that more than two thirds of our people\nWho were gun owners agreed with us or you know we lifted up four or five basic things that people said yes that that makes sense\nAnd in the end you know part of what we did as I said you know\nFor those of you know it's easy sometimes in the ... in the world around us to think that those people are and they are in RA are all gun toting nuts\nBut I I have friends and people who I loved dearly who are in the in our and they love to hunt and they're not gun toting nuts and they grieve every time there's a shooting in the school\nOn the other side you know you've got the these aren't people who want to take all your guns away these are people who want us to figure out we've got we've got to do something we got to come together and so when you can when you can treat both sides as human beings and you can help them hear each other it opens the door to finding answers\nWhat does your congregation want from its religious experience at your church do they want a place to deal with the social issues\nThat they want a refuge from the politics of the day do they just want you to stick to the scripture would they want you to be more prophetic on the issues of our times what is your congregation expressing to you know the answer is yes [laughter] a\nOf if I get emails across the spectrum I have people who are like you know I it just it makes me so mad when you talked about what's you know what's going on the news I don't want to hear about politics when it comes to church and again politics becomes the catch all phrase for something you said that I don't agree with\nAnd uh but I've got other folks were like so immigration on the border when a when the children are being separated or the news broke about that [noise]\nYou know I'm hearing this News I'm out of town I'm hearing this news throughout the week I'm studying and I'm like do I talk about that this Sunday or do I spend another week really trying to see how that's going to resolve cause I have a feeling within a week it's going to be it will start to be resolved and sure enough within a week there was an executive order and it's not all resolved but\nAnd I had people who are really mad like why didn't shoot you should've preached on this this weekend and I had other people were like thank you for not preaching on this weekend and the next week and I did I did that was Father's Day weekend I did talk about it but um so I it's all over the map on that are there but here we we also serve at the contradiction recently find out and we were doing it worships\nAnd then I'm On a response was when Adam deals with current issues where he's dealing with what's going on in the world but for every person says that there's somebody else who's saying I Wish you wouldn't do that and you're just stick to talking about love\nWe're speaking to Adam Hamilton to founding pastor of the United Methodist Church or the resurrection in league with Kansas outside Kansas City he's the author of more than two dozen books his latest is called unafraid living with courage and hope in uncertain times\nI Wonder a pastor Hamilton how you see the United Methodist Church more broadly dealing with social issues dealing with the politics of the day I don't know if your congregation and the domination or on the same track in terms of the way to deal with these issues whether the United Methodist Church more broadly is still kind of\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from

I think I actually have three I think the second one was love your neighbors you love yourself so what does it mean to love your neighbor who's a Democrat or Republican or somebody across the our somebody's vote loves Trump or somebody who hates Trump\nHow are you going to love them because you know in the end God God doesn't really care so much about what you thought about this or that President but God cares deeply about whether you love your fellow human beings and John says if you can't love your neighbor who you can see how can you say you guys you can't see\nAnd uh and so we talked about that in another one was a passage from Paul where he says let no evil talk come out of your mouth but only what is useful for building others up as there's need that your words might give grace to those who here\nSince ... and that not only applies to your words out of your mouth but the ones you type in social media how are you allow your words to give grace to others as opposed to the humanizing them or you know so if you\nCould become a passage that under some people who we just need to lead have it feels so good I mean really like we're having this debate about civility right now and I've\nSay what you know those people whoever those people are that I Need to hear and I have the answer and you need to hear it and this is America and doggone it it's my turn to talk and I'm tired of bite my tongue it feels to satisfy finally let her out\nI think that's exactly right I think that's where we feel that we have to guard against I think it it naturally now there's not this isn't saying don't share what you think about sharing what you think in a way that's reflects the humility like I could be wrong about this I don't think so but I could be wrong about this and that treats the other as a human being is really important and most of the time when we send those zingers out it feels really good and\nI'm quoting the Bible I Know one right 'cause it came out of the Bible\nYeah yeah well that goes back to our question about just a second ago about the nuances the Bible and how we read the Bible it's not quite as simple that cause I can pull out I can pull a diverse and I can venue with a thousand different versus that aren't really in keeping with the spirit of scripture but I certainly pulled out one verse out and made it made it saying\nHere's the thing especially when it comes to complex arguments political or moral arguments as you cannot have a complex argument\nIn two hundred and eighty characters on Twitter I mean thankfully they doubled the amount of space we have so we went from a hundred and forty to two hundred eighty you can't do it you can't have those kind of arguments and you're you know a nifty responses on Facebook to somebody's post\nAnd you also when it comes to posting on Facebook to figure out how can I so here's the thing I I challenged people pastors across the country we talked about prophetic preaching and prophetic preaching has to do is saying the hard things you know in addressing justice in and righteousness all these things [noise]\nBut but when it comes to prophetic preaching ask pastors you've got to decide do you want to irritate people or influence them it irritating people's easy it's just not hard to say something that's gonna hurt their feelings or irritate them or make the mad\nBut if you actually want to change somebody's mind or you want to influence their thinking you've got to figure out how do I do that so if you if you're on Facebook and you want to influence your family and friends who might have different views you got to say how could I Do that in a way that my mom who feels totally opposite of me might actually go well I hadn't thought of it that way before\nAnd that's why you know when it comes to preaching on controversial issues I typically my approach is to say here's why thoughtful people on this side see this see it this way here's wipe off of people in this I'd see it this way\nBoth putting the Bible here's where I come out I appreciate the folks on that side on this side I I find myself more compelled by this but if you're on the other side I Know how much I Love you I mean I've had people come and go I came in and I knew you were preaching this\nWhat you had to say that's gotta be hard for you though as a pastor I Know you're not trying to do harm you know just personally in your own and I I Know I got to let you go shortly but in your own spiritual walk\nI Wonder how you are dealing with this as someone who has a tremendous responsibility over a huge congregation and who knows the obligation on a pastor and who's trying I'm sure try not to hurt anybody and does it like being told\nI was ready to Germany where I Believe it started to\nBefore I let you go past her Hamilton how are you dealing with this what's your spiritual walk like these days to be prophetic and helpful and resilient in these crazy time\nI actually feel like that's a a that's a part of the calling and how God is wired me so I I feel grateful to have a chance to do that and and I feel energized by having a congregation is divided and that I'm trying to help them hear each other and find a I I told him in a polarized country you know I feel like the church has a role to play in bringing healing polarized nation\nAnd we're we're a place that's our defining value was love\nSo if we can't figure out how to do this together in our congregation what hope is there for the world so I Want you to be in a small group or a Bible study or a science class of people who disagree with you and I want you to figure out how do you listen to each other and treat each other as brothers and sisters\nAnd how do you come out with a stronger view a better view veteran form because you've listened to both sides I mean seldom are issues that were really divided about as a country\nCompletely black and white if they weren't we wouldn't be divided everybody degree but instead there is some truth on both sides there and so so anyway I when I was younger and so I'm fifty turned fifty four next month when I was in my twenties and thirties\nEvery one of those letters just felt like an arrow driven by heart it was so hard and I'd feel like I have to ratify paid response to them and I would stew on it for a long time you know and I was ready to quit if I got twenty of those emails in a week and\nAnd uh at fifty three almost fifty four I feel like it's okay you know and and I'm not going to be the right pastor for everybody I'm going to try to be the you know a great pastor to them and love my people and love God and try to model for them to Christian faith\nOne point three clocks in Lewiston\nElection day is November six would record numbers of

A. M. E. U. dot org again across America at W. A. M. U. dot org\nToday we're looking at a surge in early voting across America with the help of three stations we're partnering with\nZoe Clark is a program director at Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor Michigan she's also the co host of its program it's just politics so we welcome Joshua joining us from K. U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado north of Denver is reporter Michael ... Michael glad to have you with us\nHi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is reporter Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us I happened to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H M public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them in the weeks and months to come but let me start with the three of you in Michigan Colorado in Kansas\nWith regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth court in Michigan let me start with you with early voting looked like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase over last mid term elections I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges if I had the ... election just couldn't turn out is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during presidential election so we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTwenty four team we had six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in this day\nMichael do you want and what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nIt's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred and Nineteen thousand of them\nAnd I'm more expected this morning a we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day on election day and um uh it's it's\nIs uh what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the I'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots\nAnd Brian grim it what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs falling out of those those national trends there's a there's there's so many of the counties across the state of reporting a record or a near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they and Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting in them\nOr they're saying requests in one of the most populated counties Johnson county by near Kansas City uh they've had requests for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nLet me stick with you how does early voting works in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through out of Kansas handled voting early\nWell it depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county the way they decide um obviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the ... vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request steady and you can get sent out um it's\nSo it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who'd like to early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas or we've had early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened up a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it\nI'm somewhat accessible to to to voters would like to take that option\nWe heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research candidate amendment or proposition and leisure while completing the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado house has early voting work\nWill uh basically you get your ballot in in the mail they mail it to you um you ... you got to do a lot of research in Colorado this year it is a very full ballot and um you go through the subjects one by one it's great because\nUh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro brew we love that here in Colorado and fill out that ballot and then um get it off in the mail or or\nSome other kind of relaxing recreational kind of\nA cup of tea\nYou know a lot of people I'm like this system in Colorado but not everyone um you know that ... ... ... world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already um now you got to think about um delivering it by hand or just going in on election day in voting\nI'm Glad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting early voting should bear in mind that there is a certain cut off\nBy which your ballot has to be received November six times and I I don't know how it is for your three states\nBut every state I've lived in election day is the day your ballot has to be in not just the day that your ballot has to be in a blue mailbox so that is an object to remind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be in an election officials hand on election day not a postal carriers hand on election day\nGlad to get some of your comments as to why you do or don't like voting early\nMitch tweeted I don't vote early details may change through election day I Want my vote to be kept exactly as it should be since there are no do overs or take backs\nRachel is in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Rachel emailed I Love the convenience of early voting I don't have to worry about long lines or work or travel on election day that would prevent my voice being hurt\n... tweeted no early voting for us in Michigan we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day do you have to lie to vote early and Michigan\nFor all practical matters yeah so basically how it works in Michigan is if you want an absentee ballot you have to basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say a and there are folks that go and say should be out of town\nAnd and lie at their office in other ways that you can get absentee ballots here in Michigan one is to be over sixty years old or another it may be due to religious reasons or if you were in jail awaiting arraignment or trial but no it is\nWell known around the state that that folks do just say you know what I'm going to be out of town just take to get an absentee ballot ... what is being over sixty has to do with voting early uh possibly can make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is that there are long waits let's say for example in the ...\nSide let's say in a wheelchair for three four hours and wait to vote so that is one a one way that that you can get an absentee ballot\nWe're speaking to silly Clark program director at Michigan Radio based in Ann Arbor Michael do you want to an investigative reporter was to you in the public radio in Greeley, Colorado and Brian ... who covers energy and environment for T. M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas\nRitchie tweeted I early voted because I have an hour commute and a twelve hour a day on Tuesday\nI liked being able to look up all of the issues and candidates I was more informed and took more time with my ballot voting from home amen to that ... I have done the exact same thing especially living in California where our voter guide was about as big as I think one if not two\nOf the hobbit novels like stacked on top of one of the it was a ridiculously fit guide\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from visiting angels professional caregivers that sort of thing adults at home in bathing dressing meal and light housework nationwide visiting angels America's Choice and senior home care learn more at one eight hundred three six five four one eight nine [noise]\nAnd from progressive insurance offering a way to buy a home insurance with their home quote explorer tool custom quotes and rates are available online learn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\nBefore we get back to our conversation we would love your help with tomorrow's program about political rhetoric\nIt's a simple question is President Trump responsible for the recent acts of political violence in our country a simple question but not an easy one how much responsibility does he bear all week confusing rally rhetoric with criminal behavior\nWho else is responsible and how much blame did they bear\nWill debate this tomorrow but we'd love to hear your thoughts ahead of that so leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one day\nHow much responsibility if any does President Trump bear for the recent acts of political violence in our country\nEight five five to three six one a one a or you can use our app won a vox pop to send us a radio quality audio file and to keep up to date on future topics will share some of your thoughts tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Zoe Clark of Michigan Radio Michael do you want to of K. U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado\nAnd Brian ... of ... I mean you W public radio in Wichita, Kansas today we're introducing won a across America will be spending the next two years traveling to communities across the country that don't tend to play an outsized role\nIn national elections before he don't come come back to ... let me get to a few more of your comments Linda tweeted I voted in Hamilton County Ohio over a week ago no lines it was fast and easy\nCounty is in Illinois and county road on our Facebook page\nChoosing to vote on election day\nAnd Melissa tweeted I loved to vote in person I enjoy seeing all of the people getting out to the polls and making their voices heard\nZoe I Love you to react to a message that one of our listeners since we're app wanting vox pop from Michigan and told us three reasons that he's voting this year and all of his reasons for voting after you do with voting\nI show up for Michigan where all three branches of government or a Republican controlled and have been\nFor a number of years\nThe main driver of my voting this year or two constitutional amendments that tried to rectify the Republican attempt to suppress or control election participation proposal links to put redistricting in the hands of a nonpartisan commission\nThe other makes registering to vote easier makes absentee voting available to all and finally to prove it straight ticket voting those are pretty important to our democracy and that's why I ...\nTruck thanks for calling for leaving us a voice mail rather than through the ... what would you say the trucks call was that the kind of reflected in why a number of Michigan are voting this year\nWell let's say yes that I mean there he is speaking about proposal to which is a redistricting as he checked Saturn then proposals three which is being called promote the vote and and that would allow no excuse absentee voting earlier of course we're talking about whether you have to lie or not to to get an absentee ballot that would change how that works um\nYes ah particularly a prop too which would create this independent commission has just sort of taken the state has been a a barn storm of a\nA ballad I Am most ballot initiatives like one would like to think right that it's some people some community folks who are like we want to change the law in Michigan let's gather together and let's go you know get enough signatures and put it on the ballot no no no that is not usually how it works in this state usually a\nOrganisation some kind of a political organization pays\nFor signature sometimes a dollar two dollars per signature to get questions on the ballot but um this voters not politicians as prop to\nChanging redistricting a young woman Katie Fay he's twenty eight years old when she started this all grass roots organization got four hundred fifty thousand signatures\nAgain grassroots volunteer\nThe poll watchers in general we've heard from a number of you who are reacting to some of these initiatives in Michigan pat emailed in Michigan seniors over sixty are allowed absentee ballots I Love not having to stand in line at the polls\nThis year a referendum called promote the vote is on the ballot which would allow anyone to use an absentee ballot too many people having trouble getting to the polls on election day\nAnd John emailed I live in Ann Arbor Michigan I voted with an absentee ballot for the first time this year I Do so because I'm volunteering as an election inspector this year\nI'm also working with the voters not politicians group and supportive prompt to which if past will make Michigan one of only a handful of states with fear of voter district de\n... what's the the kind of the split in terms of who is supporting these measures\nAnd who is opposing them is it kind of a partisan split or do Michigan voters tend to kind of agree that the time has come for this how how does that shake out\nWell I mean again if you're going to take this idea that this grassroots organization that four hundred and fifty thousand signatures one would portend that that is going to create some turn out on election day or for folks who got absentee ballots I'm\nBut you you have seen the Michigan chamber of commerce which tends to lean towards conservative Republican candidates ah come out against a proposal to you've got the freedom fund which is um\nI I get money from other ... organization just last week uh putting one point two million dollars against proposal to again this is about redistricting\nProposal three though which is to promote the vote which would allow an shrine I should say straight ticket voting automatic voter registration same day voter registration and no excuse absentee voting\nWe really haven't seen a a organization fall and wholeheartedly come out against this proposal because for many folks are not only are these popular ideas but\nA majority of states and in the country twenty seven states in DC all allowed no excuse absentee voting\nMichael do you want to let me come to you with another proposition that seems to be energizing voters in Colorado and that might affect other races\nJennifer's in Colorado and she left his voice mail explaining her view on prop one twelve listen\nOne twelve on our ballot this year would increase the distance between new oil development and any building that is designed for human occupancy it would increase it to twenty five hundred feet which is less than half a mile\nAnd it's not unreasonable to me but the ads we see here are hugely fear mongering they're paid for by companies and they say you're going to\nJennifer thanks for calling in Michael can you give us a little more context on prop one twelve particularly this couch or argument that Jen says she's Jennifer ... she's been seeing on MTV I\nSure it will be a ... to put a fire point on it right now there are also a a current setback distances which are\nA five hundred to a thousand feet depending on where where you are an ... supporters say supporters of on twelve say that the wells\nAre just like Jennifer are are two already too close to people's homes schools places work and that's a threat to their health because there are these are basically the industrial sites\nThat are dangerous and uh the pollutants um the oil so the other side of this as the oil and gas industry which is which is big and Colorado um they say a this measure would essentially run them out of business because\nUm it would be difficult to find sites that are twenty five hundred feet away for every potential new site ah but just how difficult that is well you know that's debatable the the state's oil and gas conservation commission\nAnd get a study a is saying that as much as eighty five percent of new development would be halted\nA but there was an analysis from um another one of the Colorado School of mines that used a slightly different methodology\nAre taking into account possible drilling strategies and they came up with fifty eight percent so still in either case you know the industry says that's a lot of business for them that would be lost and with it\nUm there are jobs and a potential economic impact um estimates are into the billions of dollars one real high estimate was four hundred and Seventy billion dollars\nUm but you know let's go back to the other side as supporters one twelve um say that you know the industry's benefit to the state has fluctuated and decline in recent years and it's it's now about five percent of the state's economy here or there are about thirty thousand direct jobs\nUm and uh you know they um note that the um uh\nCurrent oil and gas operations those would be affected at All right Michael let me speak with you for just one second uh you've been covering the governor's race to", "show_name": "1A
