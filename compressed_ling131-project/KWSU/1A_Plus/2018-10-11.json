you make of kind of the public conversation around protests today we\nSee that when people of color in the street that everybody thinks protesting is the worst thing in the world a Trump didn't have the same comments when they when the white supremacists in Charlottesville right that in Charlottesville was so wild about Charlottesville beside the T he tortures him beside the the guy\nWith how I don't know if you saw the footage of the white supremacist literally pushing the police like as a group pushing the police and it's like that I couldn't even imagine you I've been in many places\nAnd bloodshed like I just don't even know what that looks like so to what we see here is like the the not so deadly coded language about like what happened to people of color push back and say that\nThis isn't working um you know that sort of the thing about the right is it the right it's just re packaging old messages with any language and we've seen you know laws for a long time there were like people can assemble people call it can't be in any groups like that he just like repack any that\nAre for this time that like when it's white people doing it he hasn't said the same thing\nSo that I guess gets to some of the critique about what folks on the weaker demonstration in Ferguson where some described it as unrest or or even riots that did you feel like there's a more of a racial component there than some of the critics made themselves ...\nUh you know people are always asked me if I'm over exaggerating the and the impact of Twitter and it's like Twitter literally saved our lives that like you have to remember that in twenty four teen parents go up there was nothing for glide Instagram live like none of that the only live streaming with like you stream and that was like people to pay to use it so\nIt sounds like Twitter was like the mechanism if you remember that the the first city that she thought ... do you remember the first city that you thought aerial footage of the protest at\nThe first city um that you saw aerial footage I'd I don't remember the first city and now I remember seeing it and being stunned by it but I don't remember the first city\nIn Baltimore you didn't see any you you've never seen any arrow footage of the protest in St Louis because they declared a no fly zone immediately so I can make a killing the night and they declared enough I'm going to twelve so\nLike there was no way for you to see what's happening if it wasn't people who are on the ground and I think one of the things that like work tie benefit is that the media came in and you're right the language is like the riders like you know ... being dramatic industry and like that\nAnd then the police are like indiscriminately wild like I remember when Don Lemon got tear gas and it was one of those moments where like he was one of those people on the news that of a quid vacating about the police and he's got he's like no they the protests are right where like yes we knew we were right right or like\nYou brought up the five second rule that people don't people don't remember that it was illegal to stay until August September October twenty four team that if we still\nFor more than five seconds or arrested like that's why we marched all day not because he's not marching with like the most effective tactic like we had to march and like people forget those things and I never want to lose sight of how fragile freedom is and that was one of the big takeaways from being in the street for the initial wave of the protests in St Louis\nOr speaking to dream a caisson his new book is called on the other side of freedom the case for hope we got a number of voice mails from some of our listeners about you and your work\nYou are respond to criticism from your opponent when they say just outlandish ridiculous things like black lives matter is a terrorist organization I'm it's just as bad as the Ku Klux Klan and just as bad as neo Nazis and if you guys this fall for what happened at the Charlottesville protests like how do you guys respond to that\nAndrew thanks very much for contacting us through our apple won a vox pop to write what would you say the Andrew ... so we know that that is an attempt to distract them so when we when we think about like why do we focus on black people the first thing that we can focus on\nThe issue around police volunteer the violence and that doesn't mean that we don't care about the other issues to I can go to a breast cancer rally and that doesn't mean that I don't care about colon cancer just means that I'm focusing on this specific issue\nIn this way why focus on black people is that we know that the disparities in the outcomes are just so bad for people of color that we fix their for black people who actually automatically fix it for everybody else that like that makes sense\nI think that the other points to like you know where the cause of the violence and things like that it's like you know when I was in the street the only about ... hours of onto the police and like we wouldn't have been there the police and killed anybody and remember that like the problem is a problem all across the country thinking about California wine and eleven gun homicides in California is actually committed by police officer that's like\nThat's wild you know like this is a big issue\nAnd there are structural reasons that the police never get out of cannabis you think about places like California where there's a lot of that\nLiterally any investigation of an office in the last more than a year can never resolved discipline regardless of the outcome and Cleveland they destroy a police officer disciplinary records every two years\nIn Maryland my home town and a lot and said that ah you can follow ... complaining it's an officer for everything except brutality so we hear these sort of deflecting like you know why are you guys doing this you guys are bringing the pain I\nThe way I respond to it's just always like ... back to what the facts aren't the second thing I think very quickly if I had no longer even really preachy about this stuff I Want to have other people explained to me so you know when people tell me that social welfare programs are bad and like why are we just giving people they asked them like what does a four year old has to do to earn dinner\nWith having your own have to do\nTo be worthy of shelter like you tell me how they earn dinner ... like I Want to hear them explain that to me like people say Mike Brown didn't have his hands up and say should probably be dead today for supposedly Jay walking like he is at a consequence or with the police you know I'm going to a lot of panels at the police and they'll say to me is a lot of crime crimes and crimes bad or\nAre you saying the police you never kill somebody and I say to them like telling\nWhat the mistake that you'd be okay with the officer putting a bullet through your child [noise]\nShe was like I don't know like on the on on on that right so a part of my work at the share the cognitive bird\n[noise] much more to discuss as we continue our conversation would dream of cats than I Do want to talk to you more of course about the black lives matter movement particularly your role which in it I'm Joshua Johnson and you're listening to one a firm W.

I can remember and now with us that and that's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter that I Know that we walk into every runner bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room and what does it mean to be worthy that if she can leave it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to have to work within and grow with as an adult to make\nTo run the meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nCore part of it that the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy is that for so many people you think about like the constraints what many people who grow up in marginalized communities are there's poverty race\nOr any other after today deputy they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had in the family and I knew what ... what not to ask why new\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside and you know a lot of people talk about growing up poor but not sad one of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraints said like they can strengths become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive\nThat we can't start that magic things beyond it and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd like you think about it ever seen the writing the lessons at the right it's always ... packaging old narratives for a new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe that you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling those stories that actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good storyteller by the future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you into the world\n[noise] you also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times that are rather young age\nAnd you connect that was what you call the client quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never seen any part of myself from my self or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love the parts that I had never seen loved\nIn others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons why I was important for me to be out during a break\nI mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very ... way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gay today that the only way\nTo do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and ah you know that chapter started from a tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know it doesn't mean it wasn't real like I was in the quiet\nReal to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collective with John social justice or the work that we need to do without talking about my own identity I wrote about the uh the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "11"}
