I'm thinking you put a bunch of updates and like that's in there and you're going to get this ball rolling around the queen of the the the like being like Dicky ball of a match\nAnd then you would like to get out with your hands and like I went out with a rolling ten and then um\nI got to cut her and I would like to cut her and I would cut it out just in your kitchen and and I would make samples I mean batch after batch after batch\nAnd did you have any of your own if you have any cash to just to sort of actually parse to help you out in a year while you were not you know we're getting a salary how did you pay your bills um within\nAbout a week I realized oh I I had a little bit of money saved up and then I saw it and they start the business but I have to work I have to get a job you know so whole foods\nOpen their first store in Denver at exactly the same time and I started seeing the building go up and they and and the neighborhood I grew up and actually and I thought I'm going to get a job with them\nI'm going to work and their nutrition department doing what I Love but I'm going to figure out the business and how it works\nAll the nutrition products and it was one of the best decisions I ever made\nSo at what point did you think to yourself is really going to be the big deal like people don't want my body's\nI'm not sure I ever thought that it was such a gradual progression though I first got my recipes together and I would give them out to friends and then friends would say\nI Would buy this and that that little tidbit of asking me to buy it would make me feel so excited and motivated to get to the next place which was\nHow in the world to manufacture these things yeah where am I going to get dates and almonds and cherries and at the time I started questioning am I actually going to do this or shakes kind of work for a whole foods able to do that\nAnd just to clarify again our you know just like sort of funding this business like binding green stuff this is when you're using your own money\nAnd you know I had a job at whole foods and then I had a credit card and were you nervous or anxious at all I don't know I I Would have moments where I Would be really gung ho and I would get all kinds of grain information in a month would go by and I would find out about\nA piece of manufacturing equipment or just little things and I would be motivated and somebody want to buy bars and they make them at a batch of bars and these little Ziploc bags and their little Chinese takeout box and and I would they would pay me like twenty two dollars or something for a box of bars and I would think wow\nAnd then another month to go by where I couldn't get anywhere I felt like my feet were stuck in the mud and then I Would just get really motivated and nothing happened and then went on for a three year period between my idea of pain and when actually launched so\nI'm trying to figure out how you maintained your ah your optimism and confident about all this because I mean you're thirty two are divorced and I\nImagine you probably have some emotional ups and downs of this plan and and I will like was part of you [noise] I mean did you ever get the feeling that people like you and I think I had a little rushed to this kind of weird ... project\nA lot of people thought that I mean\nI Would see people I went to high school with and they would come into whole foods and you know they ... they're they're already climbing the ladder big jobs in finance\nMe and even if I had those moments where people were ... I Would notice the fact that I wasn't on that trajectory I finally just said this is your path in life and you have to go for it and embrace it and make it happen [noise]\nWhen\nWe come back ... embrace the uncertainty and slowly slowly figured out how to turn her kitchen project into a business [noise] stay with us I'm Guy ride and you're listening to how I built it from NPR I mean [noise]\nThere is a chance of brain tonight on the list and in the Lewis clocks valley expectancy lows in the upper forties and the lower fifties looking ahead to tomorrow rain showers in the morning which could continue into the afternoon\nIt could also be windy Pullman we'll see how high up fifty five in Lewiston sixty one\nAmong those people a lot some package bombs sent a prominent Democrat or national or how is the rhetoric and politics and media shaping the way we talk to one another and it's been Twenty years the Harry Potter for me which readers\nLiterary legacy on the news from Washington and around the world Sunday on weekend edition NPR\nListen tomorrow morning from five to nine right here on your NPR News service northwest public broadcasting [noise] good evening I'm Claire Martin tell us thank you for treating end to end up er UP be on your Saturday\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with the legacy of putting clients financial wellbeing first learned more it Raymond James dot com\nAnd from Tara data working to transform how businesses work through the power of data using pervasive data intelligence Tara data leverage is all relevant data to deliver answers to complex business issues Tara data dot com\nWelcome back to how I built this from NPR I'm tired rod so it's two thousand one large American\nIs working at whole foods and Denver and she's\nTrying to figure out how to start a company\nBut you don't have a whole lot of money and she doesn't have any professional equipment\nOr even a way to process and package\nHer energy bars so eventually I went to a packaging company in Denver\nWell I I said I Need packaging and then they they look at me go huh I mean they couldn't take me seriously didn't even have a business\nYou want it you were looking for somebody who has two great packaging package or bar shifts and and meanwhile back at home you're you're still using a Cuisinart yeah\nBecause he's in the ... and I was trying to find a giant Cuisinart I was trained that I didn't even know what that was called is called the vertical cutter mixture I learned and [laughter]\nAnd then that led to some guy that had a piece of manufacturing equipment that low and behold was the exact thing that I needed to go to the queen ... and that's how it all kind of piece together yeah\nAnd and by the you know raise some money so I had raised any money and read any okay I wrote a story I wrote a business plan my dad helped me write a business plan\nI had a few friends and family interested and I was going to launch in fall of two thousand two [noise] and that got delayed until April of two thousand three [noise] and during that time all of my interest in friends and family\nBacked out they because they got cold case it was yeah it was just getting to late so what'd you do\nWell I had to had to raise the money and my dad had decided he would lead he wanted to get involved in the company and he called me one day and he said hey\nWould you would you want a business partner and then how much money did you decide that you needed terrain [noise] I think we came up with the amount because I had to print packaging and we had five flavors that I was watching\nWith and there was a minimum print run of all of those and I actually printed\nI'm at this company in Minnesota and I remember it costing somewhere around ... you know a hundred a hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nBut how did you find the stores to to buy and then ...\nWell let me let me backtracking to where it when I was working at whole foods before he left the one morning I was there and one of the gross you guys said\nLearn the guy you need to me he's the regional buyer from Austin and he's he's the guy who's coming in here I Am I'm taking trash out one morning it's about eight Fifteen in the morning and he walks across my path", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Pullman", "day": "28"}
