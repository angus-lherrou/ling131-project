broadcasting\nYou're listening to Planet Money so so you know how to milk the cow by hand\nOh yeah oh yeah you know anti tobacco spent his time or is it as a kid working on his grandparents dairy farm in Wisconsin\nAndy is still in the dairy world he is now a dairy economist at Cornell University and and what percentage of economists would you say are able to milk the cow by hand\nUh will probably uh you know close to a hundred percent are able to Ninety nine point nine percent wouldn't have the ... who get started\nIn the pantheon of milk related economic disasters there is one that rises above the rat and Andy had it rings tied to it\nThis is one of those slow moving train wrecks that you can see coming from a mile away\nIt was Nineteen Seventy thick Jimmy Carter was running for president and he started flooding this idea\nOf how the bombing of\nA fan of dramas way one\nOf the ways Carter proposed giving farmers an equal break with to raise the price of milk by about six cents per gallon which was kind of a lot at the time\nIt certainly was on the edge of that it was a big enough number\nCampaign promise that's what we call the you know there you go\nIt's not just political pandering there is an argument that our country has to be able to produce its own sued because they are farmers go out of business and we become reliant on other countries for food then that is a kind of national security risk\nAnd it's our country has a tradition of programs to help farmers but what do you need to talk of its new is it it's one thing to provide stability is another to step into the market in a big way maybe the wrong time because playing with price controls he's playing with fire\nNevertheless when Carter got elected he goes all in\nThe retail price of milk was going up more than six cents a gallon to just going up because the government does\nAnd do you you hear of it and he likes back your forehead boy here we go\nIt was pretty hard to predict that we'd get as bad as God but every instinct I had said the ... has been workouts [noise]\nHello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Karen Duffin and I'm Kenny Malone today on the show the story of what happened with the president of the United states died and he was going to help America's farmers\nBy buying milk loss of it is a case study in what happens when tight controls runs full feed into the reality of the market there will be a cave in Kansas City a van down by the river\nAnd the touching exchange between Martha Stewart\nIn dogs do you mean by governments she don't why you got to be on a fresher

like we know we also love the farmers and so they pass a law saying that they want the price of milk to go up automatically every six months it's one thing for\nBut the problem Andy said was that a lot of this was not easy to give away she's there were forty pound block than five hundred pound barreled\nSo you can imagine you know you don't just kind of rules on one of these barrels down a seventh avenue in New York City and say anybody wants to choose\nWhat you just have a big night\nYeah there you go to help yourself\nSo instead the cheddar cheese was processed that helps that keep longer and then it was repackaged in two and five pound like brick\nAnd this is what people will remember as a government cheese because when government starts to give away hundreds of millions of pounds of cheese people notice\nThe great changed give away began today in California San Francisco was one of the three cities in which needy people lined up to get the surplus this footage is amazing style massive crowds of people\nAnd some black USDA stamps on it and\nHe's a state official estimated three hundred thousand people will get a taste of today's to\nIt at this moment the government's she's truly enters the American dream as we unloaded the caves full of the staff governments she started to show up everywhere food bank and schools military Matt tall\nFor a lot of people who grew up in the Nineteen seventies and eighties you cannot overstate how influential government cheese became back\nMany listeners may remember Saturday Night live match fully fest played by

cheese from the refrigerator if the girl's government she's also shows up in tons of\nSongs that government we bought we would get like a lot of downs in the morning it was something she mentioned\nBut maybe government she's the most surreal moment came on a television show where Martha Stewart cook that with me [noise]\nGovernment she became a symbol of a crappy government handout and to be fair was processed cheese kind of like a brick um Velveeta but remember the raw ingredients word grade aged cheddar cheese some of it personally certified by Bob ... rock\nIt was ten times better than belt I hate the valve eaters okay it's got it's OK okay we're we're not here to ... veto but I'll tell you the the government process loaf was ten times a hundred times better than it was some of it almost feels like natural cheddar I mean it was really really good product\nThis is why there is also a community of people who are still obsessed with government cheese Internet chat board trying to find something comparable restaurants claiming they have a recipe for it\nAt one point Donny Walberg of the new kids on the block said quote there's nothing like it the way it melts for a hamburger there is nothing better [noise]\n\nParents doing the dance Cary doing the dance strains but here is why government cheese has become a kind of terrible of how\nI got on stage and said something seemingly innocuous\nWay\nAnd then within five years the government was spending billions of dollars filling caves with cheese that they could not get rid of fast enough\n[noise] well I think there's there's two basic lessons\nAgain economist Andy ... which\nOne is it's really hard to balance what you want to do socially or politically with what you can get away with economically the second lesson is you've got to pay attention to the unintended consequences because they can come back and bite you and by jarred\nEven if that bite just looks like some delicious cheese [laughter] I mean\nThat was the unintended consequences it was fun but the bike came in terms of how much it cost for that I rented\nVery very expensive cheese indeed the government cheese caves started to empty out the guaranteed milk price which had been going up automatically every six months was eventually frozen\nBut that does not mean the government had fix the problem is the thing about price controls that once you start then they are really really hard to unwind\nSo we have a you know the cement surplus and now you have the political problem how do we how do we get this cat out of the tree and\nThe government asked the economists including ... to figure out how it could get out of the cheese buying business without devastating the farmers they were trying to help in the first place\nThis is a basic supply and demand problem the government was demanding an unnatural amount of milk and so farmers were supplying an unnatural amount of milk\nOne part of the solution then was two jet Li get that milk supply down\nTo persuade farmers to produce less we literally paid them money to stop producing milk\nThat did some good and then on the other side the government tried to replace some of their artificial demand for milk with new real demand for milk like\nHave people of America wouldn't you like to drink more now [laughter]\nWe took a a small amount of money from every dairy farmer collected on every ... years old and we created the national dairy board but this is what gave us a you know the got milk and the milk mustache and all those kind of iconic programs that we remember\nThat is right Jimmy Carter's campaign promise to help farmers in Nineteen Seventy six not only gave US government cheese but also\nPut the milk support program on a kind of permanent bench for these days if the government wants to help farmers don't generally hear about our direct subsidies as opposed to buying cheese yes the the government has tended\nTo stay away from buying cheese a solution that is until last July\nThe White House is coming to the eight of farmers hurt by its own hardline trade policies the Trump Administration says today it will make an estimated twelve billion dollars in government assistance available\nThe Trump Administration announced that in order to help farmers being hurt by Trump's tariffs the government may be making some food purchases again and then in August we learn some of the details there's currently about eighty five million dollars earmarked to buy dairy and distributed to places like schools\nAnd food banks got to be fair ... probably not enough to start building caves with you again but they're\nGiven a chance to government aid you into fitness [noise] up government Kay [noise] today's episode was produced by

that today [noise]\nYou know so there are moments\nWhere I'm very slow still you know and there are moments when I'm not I was raised to think that money was everything you know money is the center of
