himself\nFor long super chisel due to a logging on to leave their super honest reviews and look I Know not all bodybuilder sound this way\nThese reviews of adults five days pretty suspicious and especially when you look at the reviews from those five days compared to the average ... their way more positive\nHe says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well there was a one ...\nAnd basically what we do is we we built a gigantic list of all of the phrases that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\n... them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example it was a and this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated for example\nThe court is very tough and doesn't bend like the courts do but that's probably a good thing that's not you know that you shouldn't do that and more than one review but for here we see it in three reviews [noise] um yeah\nAnd and in seven reviews someone wrote it's easy to get it back onto the court and to use again ah I don't know what it means for seven people feel that way [laughter] well seven people also say they performed\nAt their duty with honor and respect there is the correct words [laughter] yeah so\nTommy software random about a dozen different tasks than I Am phone cable reviews and his reports it out and it just aggravating\nUh so it went from a four star out of five with a hundred and Seventy seven reviews on Amazon and the adjusted rating on review Mehta is one point seven stars after ten

self admitted that they do not have the data to know or even a with high confidence whether a review with fake according to\nWhat Amazon is saying it's not necessarily different from what Tommy told us about his own website he totally admits that his site is looking for patterns of unusual behavior and there's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as a natural\nAnd take Amazon also told us that it's investing in its own system to catch fake busy or\nIn other words the Amazon saying there's not a problem but we're working on it and this makes me like I Wonder a little bit how much should I trust the big sites like Amazon are actually going to go out of their way to fix this\nSuch complicate it right because these e commerce sites they make money when they sound more products\nRight like it doesn't matter if it's a positive Ficre view if someone buys a product that's good for the site\nBut that that might come a time where there was just too many fake pretty sure like\nThere's a

how he eventually build an Arab reading is just how\nMany times along the way he sees new opportunities or mass to improvise and the data again and again and again Ron comes to a point where\nAfter Iran acquires a small fringe bakery in Boston called a ... a business that's really struggling he manages to turn things around with his partner ... but it's still a small business in fact run himself works at the sales can er during the day [noise]\nLike doing that actually helps and figure out almost by accident hit next opportunity\nIn Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five\nI Would be in a restaurant and working [noise] and I'd have a customer walk up to me guy and so they\nCould I have a bad guy and I said sure and they say ISIS I'd have them do both and they pull out of back from the local supermarket from a local stop and shop and they'd put roasted turkey and maybe [noise] she's on it and you know you didn't have to be a Harvard MBA\nTo say wow the real thing here\nIs that the ... is not the end it's the platform to sell sandwiches and so in Nineteen eighty five we created the first French bakery cafe in the Copley Place mall in Boston she decided that you are going to make\nThis a new experience and New Zealand than experience where people could come and\nEat lunch and buy bread yeah we're going to go from being simply a bakery to a bakery cafe right\nAnd almost instantly is broken down company became very hot people wanted this I can remember the second day um that we opened in Copley Place we had fifty people in line while before we opened the doors\nAnd what were you surprised there [noise] um we were serving sandwiches\nAnd some suits made on our Britain costs on\nBut they were differentiated kinds of sandwiches they were roast beef and enforce on an real French back at it would be a\nRoast the turkey brie cheese um and I think what Obama was providing and I don't think we hit the language for its back then but what the big recap I was\nWas an alternative between down and dirty fast food yeah it's fine dining and for people who were working in white collar jobs increasingly in urban settings this was the first example of what we later came to cough vast casual\nThis was an attempt to do something that was better\nIn a quick service mode [noise] so so once you know surf stones idea of creating cafes and ... it was after\nWell guy we you know as soon as we came up with this idea of a bakery cafe we saw all kinds of interested in how we became hot you know every major office building one of the French the crickets and we found we developed big competitors [noise]\nAlright says something something happens early in this period as shortly after you go public which is of on panic choirs is a small chain of St Louis based\nSandwich shops called the St Louis bread company what what's the story there why did you buy this like small chain in St Louis with the with the idea to to turn into a bomb had\nNo I you know I talked to everybody in our industry and there's nobody I don't learn from and I was asked by an investment bank to be several gentleman who owned a company called St Louis brand company and it hit me these were Nineteen stores in St Louis\nDoing ... homeless as much as we did within Obama pet\nBut doing so in suburban St Louis and it struck me this was an opportunity to acquire St Louis bread company and maybe we could build it into three hundred four hundred five hundred stores in suburban marketplace while oh bumped him was our urban stresses\nSo in November of Nineteen Ninety three we bought the St Louis brick company\nWas Nineteen stores for twenty three million dollars\nYou acquire St Louis bread company and you will not going to give it the name of them had it was going to be [noise] St Louis red company or did you initially did you immediately realize you've been to rename this thing [noise]\nBut we rename than cuts a\n... in all markets other than St Louis but we renamed it ... bread because as we went to new market people often thought St Louis was more associated with Clydesdale horses are all out than it was with breath right and so we wanted an empty vessel personality we could form\nSo out of curiosity in that by Ninety eight you're you're watching St Louis ... really start to grow do you remember how many stores you had at that point where we could you expand beyond his original Nineteen\nYeah by Nineteen Ninety we've roughly had a hundred and fifty stores and I was having one of those moments that all CEOs that of self reflection\nAnd frankly I was kinda bummed I was looking at an Arab read as one of ... or divisions in this multi dimensional restaurant cut it open than I had a bump\nAnd I said you know for every hundred people talk about having a nationally Dominic ... to do so is so difficult but this one has that potential to my friends looked at me and said Ron what would you do it narrow owned Obama pen\nNot ... I said you know they take away all the resources we\nHad put it against an Arab becoming a nationally dominant brand\nAnd I take myself and the very best people we had and I go down there and make it happen you were proposing to sell all bon pan [noise] and I was proposing to sell everything other than that you were saying all ... all the human resources and myself and go down and make this happen", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "21"}
