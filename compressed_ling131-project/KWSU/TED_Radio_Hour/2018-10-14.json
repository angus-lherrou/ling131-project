I kind of started her with\nMaybe we should say uh\nWhere are you\nFind you money to get my name is\nNot\nEasy by Catherine Rampell him at home instead of watching it on\nThe civically captured writes about the economy for the Washington Post and it occurred to us that actually a coffee shop is the perfect place to show this thing that he Yuri\nSo you're looking at an icy what size you looking for\nMuch of anything that's on the board\nThey're a little misleading\nOkay so maybe that sounds like somebody buying iced tea and then having to pay tax but it only sounds normal because we've gotten used to it\nWith Catherine sees here is one price on the board\nAnd then this extra hidden thing that she has to pay for it and it's not just taxes sometimes it's fees and service charges that seemed to appear out of thin air at checkout and drive us all crazy booking rental cars buying concert tickets for like have you looked at a hotel room recently sometimes\nThere's an Internet feed sometimes there's a parking fee sometimes there's something called a resort fee even though you're staying in a place that's not a resort it's by the highway anyways Catherine brought her iced tea into the studio to explain why these fees and service charges or not just annoying they are bad for the economy\nCompanies should be competing based on price and quality and not application\nUh and the fact that companies do compete on application did not create a better economy is not creator got better experience for consumers and can in fact raise prices for consumers that they're buying stuff that they don't want it's like everyone has a used car sales [laughter]\nI have a very good friend who's a used car sales so I I don't want to denigrate that profession specifically\nSo what is your one tiny tweak that would change the world\nMy my one tiny tweak is that we should require more all inclusive upfront pricing including taxes fees particularly in common type of consumer purchases where people like to comparison shop\nThe price should be the price [noise]\nThat is how Catherine Rampell\nWould make the world better with one simple tweak [noise] hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Nick fountain Dan I'm Kenny Malone and sometimes on Planet Money\nWe tackled the world's big questions but today on the show we look for small dancers something we've done here before we called the smartest people we know and we asked him what TV things would you change about the world to make our lives better we have a suggestion for how you can get more money from your boss\nHow to make the most boring sport littlest boring band how to take down the wedding industrial complex\nFor NPR comes from the station\nIn other words when your head you get fewer chances to score your

Nineteen sixties\nOver a hundred thousand games and asked us to catch up ... been in place how would things have changed\nAs an inpatient baseball fan how much shorter with these games are better than the average game which now has three hours in five minutes would be cut by twenty four minutes by cutting almost a half an hour from a game and a half an hour was the game yes and\nNot only were the games shorter say we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with it's declining attendance\nSo how have fans\nReacted to this teeny tiny tweak to America's pastime well a critically I Would say [laughter] let's just say a there has been a lot of angry baseball fans but Steve is not here to win a popularity contest in fact\nHe tells that he's also got a version of the catch up rule for America's actual favorite sport football\nIn the NFL we would give the winning team only three downs rather than for down to make a first down\nSteve you were like you're blowing up every single sport\nOh yeah we have an idea for basketball that we would instead of giving the team ahead twenty four seconds to shoot we'd be in the multi Eighteen seconds at the end of the game\nHome like wow you are a true iconoclast well [laughter] we'll see what happens we don't want to hold you or any longer thank you so much for coming in yeah thank you professor thanks very

and then just about any other and it's pretty unlikely tail to begin with and\nTo eat go hippie farmers with no real desire to build a company wind up building a company they start small milking their own cows making their own yogurt spelling locally to nuns and then eventually spreading themselves way too thin and sliding into deep dad you\nKnow over the years Tony hill that headache bulls is Lou of near death experiences\nBut it never quite guided in fact it grew and grew into one of the most popular yogurt brand in the United states and one thing about Tony Fields cofounder Gary Hertzberg is that even though he didn't\nReally set out to build a company he knew what it took to run one because when he was growing up in Manchester New Hampshire his dad owned and ran a pretty big shoe company\nYou know it it was a in those days there were probably fifty shoe manufacturers and New Hampshire alone and probably a hundred and fifty in New Hampshire Maine and Vermont so so how many people did your dad's company employ several thousand I think at their peak they were at the twenty eight hundred wow these are true company\nTown of course in those days manufacturing was a you know the state was built in the region in the country were were built on things that we made the dark side of that is that when they simply\nBecause of a cheaper labor from abroad when the domestic shoe industry collapsed [noise] you know all these communities did as well and what happened to your family\n[noise] ah well it was really a three and a free for uh the family's business uh went bankrupt or my parents got divorced\nAnd my ah sort of childhood role model a died suddenly of spinal meningitis so it was uh\nBegan drinking [noise] um [noise] and so I had to sort of confront all of that and

influence on you did you did you start to think about a business about being a businessman at that early I mean you say your parents are both entrepreneurial\nNo I I started thinking about running as far as I possibly could away from it [noise]\nYou know I obviously the bankruptcy didn't happen overnight it was a result of a steady decline and my my grandfather my father and my uncle we're all in the business and I used to sit\nOr work in there and I would listen to them screaming at each other you know they were arguing you know uh I'm passionately\nOr about what to do about this downturn and so to me business with this thing\nWhere people got people yelled at each other people hung\nUp funds on each other people were stressed or employees lost their jobs\nAnd it and on top of that serious a pollution so it led to my decided in the business was the worst thing on the planet the last thing I should I wanted to do and led me to really pursue a career in science and environmental\nSo so what'd you do after high school I went off to\nCollege that was just a pet over an old vertically liberal arts are sort of non business environment it was capture Khalid Oh yes right which in\nHow much yogurt were you making at that point we're producing now about three hundred and sixty cases a week of yogurt and a case like twenty four ... six packs of court\nSo by the end of eighty four we

Samuel an stony field are almost broke their basically running on fumes and they're trying to bring in more money by just finding a few more stores to sell their yogurt\nThose as a whole foods didn't exist yet but the holy grail for natural products was a little three store chain called bread and circus which eventually became part of hoped for and they had one store in Cambridge and prospects drink and you know we were selling now to Jim Lewis market basket this is now I'm\nIf we can crack bread and circus every other little natural food co-op and New England would then take us in\nAnd we kept going down there and and they said no no no we've already got you know a hippie yogurt made by somebody in Vermont to her in the TPP would there what do you know they didn't need another you know organic yogurt from some crazy people in a hamster [laughter] ...\nWhat you guys do so in July of eighty four I had my thirtieth birthday at the farm and my I had my old ultimate Frisbee team um come up to visit me most of whom lived in Cambridge you might imagine\nAnd um I said look it's wonderful you've outcome if you want to give me a really good birthday present good under bread and circus prospects in Cambridge and asked for my yoga and that was on a Sunday on Wednesday Mary Carol Skinner the buyer bread and circus called into Garry I don't know what's going on but demand and suddenly gone through the\nRoof were getting all kinds of requests for yoga ... when when you can you get it in there well I got in my car and I made the first deliberate that afternoon [noise] um about\nA month later we were her number one selling yogurt\nOr she took us in the other two bread and circus and awfully went but it was my Frisbee team I mean you know that's what it takes I you know I always say we can ship the yogurt three thousand miles this last\nEighteen Inches that makes all the difference you get it and people smiled and then they're going to ask for an end run around the time you need a magazine would become your wife right yeah I don't know a month after that fateful meeting with bread and circus we had our summer no for conference\nNortheast organic farming association covers and I I as it turned out I was the keynote speaker and the right after I finished my speech this very adorable\nOr organic farmer from New Jersey who is running her own nonprofit farm down there\nI waited patiently to ask me a question well that turned out to be what is now my thirty one year wife Meg and her mom had been the deputy commissioner of agriculture for New York state so she had a kind of an ag orientation um\nAt one point she kind of whisper to me that she'd be okay with\nAh if I needed some money with lending me some well of course that needed money so she loan to a fifty thousand dollars [laughter]\nI started raising and I I got to about two Seventy five three hundred ... a sort of a month or so later she said well I think we can increase so she increase to a hundred and eventually I got across the finish line got the five hundred\nIt's because they know that you might as an entrepreneur if things get rough you you might just get up and walk away if it's you know some Harvard MBA with with with a tie but if it's your mother's money huh yeah yeah and so now we worked for our moms which must have been pretty stressful\nOh yeah you know what happened\nIn this farmhouse I always had payroll on Thursday mornings\nAt at this point of the half a million dollar business and I never had cash in the bank that night before payroll never just this is became our way of life and so uh thinking ... was a sleep in our bedroom which was about fifty feet from my office I Would\nOn many occasions tip\nToe over to the office\nTo call my mother in law to have a chance to see if I could borrow another thirty five hundred twenty five hundred to make ends meet\nAnd eventually ... got onto this and one night I heard the click click a call waiting on my mother in law and Meg was calling from the house to say mom don't\nDo that what your wife was telling her mom not to lend you money for the business right because right well 'cause she didn't have confidence that they were lifted she's living in a nightmare me she saw how crazy it was I mean we had chimney fires\nWe had the well pump would go out that\nThe power would I mean we're on the hilltop farm a long way from anywhere was make things you can ditch your bag it I mean or or did you get this sounds like maybe she didn't believe in it [noise] well she had no reason to believe in it it was insane but why did you believe in it that did you think you are what\nTwo three years into this thing and not only are you making money you are in that big the big time\nYeah [noise] well I'll say that um [noise] Meg a you know fortunately loved me even more forcefully probably love the yogurt and we're nowhere else to go [noise]\n\nYou know she had given up her job done under prime in New Jersey has signed on to this crazy them enterprise but here's where the story if I Know that you think you couldn't get worse but it has a Lily Tomlin says it\nIt it ... it it got a lot worse before it got worse okay what happened what happened well so now I'm going to jump a year and a half\nWe've now expanded the plant were buying milk from ten or twelve farms and we have maxed out this little farm there is no you cannot squeezed another drop of yogurt out of this place so presumably you are looking to to work with another factor\nWith a little dairy in western Massachusetts Greenfield math we were desperate we did not do any of the financial due diligence one would normally do\nWhat happens for us with their bank went in and put 'em in the chapter seven padlocked complain locked it up\nWait a
