[noise]\nKnow I I'm intrigued with the language that people use the other people use when they describe you and this is these are both\nTold her is the poet architect that's poet hyphen architect and the arena of witness and belonging um or those words specifically I mean that's how somebody else has described here but are those words meaningful for you to you know what they're getting out and and what does that mean to you\nOr I didn't want to jump back to wounded knee or stand creek I wanted to say this is what it's like here and now you know in my own lifetime\nThis is not history this is not old history it's ...\nUm someone recently asked me a little bit embarrassing um they pointed out how many pieces include my daughter [laughter] and it was like oh my gosh that's so true but I was a little embarrassed just because they didn't want to seem obsessed\nBut um I think that that was important to me as well um that\nIt's not not just not the past it's it's the president and the future I guess that is a world where creating exactly [noise]\n\n\nI'm Krista ... and this is on being today with the poet lately long filter [noise]\n\nYeah I feel like we're talking about something very specific but we're speaking at a moment of time of incredible fracture\nAnd there's a lot of apology type thing that hasn't happened and and we're actually building up a lot of things are going to have to apologize for [laughter] I'm a you know one thing I find really interesting that you do in warehouses and it's not just the IRS not only talking about history you're you're also bringing in\nIntelligence from life about what an apology is and and how when apologies are done well\nI mean these are things that there are scientists are studying to write and I just what you said I mean ... they can now watch someone gave a real apology and haven't received and how to start changing things in our brain [noise]\nOh really yeah I didn't but it has to be here but it has he's in the right and there's there's I contact and so you register that you register that anyway so you wrote in the beginning at the actually the beginning of the response whereas\nWhen offered an apology I watch each movement the shoulders high or folding tilt of the head both eyes down or straight through [noise]\nUm I listen for cracks and nickels or in the word choice what is it that I Want to feel and mind you I feel from my son to\n... [laughter] yeah\nIt's really important deliberation ... decision\nDear citizenship yeah there's a physical presence the energy that is important\nBut on a national scale I mean it's also not just a personal apology so there's things that um are bigger than a bigger than having just let's say\nYou know a family members to down next to me and apologize I'm at a national level there's a lot more that goes with it right [noise]\nUm when I was writing this response or I started researching a lot of other apologies around the world or a national apologies\n[noise] one of the apologies that I was really interested in was the one in Canada\nYeah first missions people the first nations right yeah I'm On the boarding school a residential schools\nFor what happened there and the taking of their children and so on\nAnd that apology was read out loud it was like a verbal speech it was a transmitted through um their national television and it had a very different quality there is a very different quality to the language\nAnd pasting of that apology [noise] um I always remember there was this one little a\nShort interview with a an elder or an elder native woman and I can't remember her tribe but in any case so they asked her if things had changed and she said in her opinion no things had really not really changed\nBut she said in just very very simple terms\nShe said you know if you want things to change\nAll you have to do is begin by honoring your treaties huh and doing what you said you would do yeah\nBut I think there has to be a as a kind of trust building right in order for any any kind of apology to be effective whether it's inter personal or at a national level [noise]\nWhat other things you point out is that um and this was President Obama\nCeremony and there are no tribal leaders and I just to witness that I'm right and that ceremony is an important\nWay and\nTribal culture to make something meaningful to signify that something has meaning\n\nI think it's important in tribal culture but I think we have ceremonies all the time the White House yeah yeah right right right yeah I mean it seems like\nThere's all kinds of ceremonies going on over there at the White House [laughter] yeah [laughter] Mm\nMm Mm [noise]\nYears lately long soldier reading some lines from her book where at [noise]\nI did not desire in childhood to be a part of this but desired most of all to be a part\nOf peace combined with others\nTo make up a whole some but not all as something in ... tons apiece or part of anything like the creek trickling behind my aunt's house\nWhere uncle built a bridge to cross from bank to bank\nNot far from a grassy clearing with three key piece\nA place to gather I think of planes wind snow drift eyes and limbs the exposure\nAnd when I applied my arms into a wall coat and put my hand to the door not ready to break this sub Zero Dark someone said be careful out there always consider the snow your friends\nThink badly of any snow all burn you I was ... remembering that for millennia we have called ourselves welcome to meaning friend [noise]\nOur ally\nIts relationship\nSome but not all\nStill are key to everything [noise]\n\nOoh\n\n\n\nAfter a short break more with lately long soldier [noise] we're putting all kinds of great extra poetry music and the new feature living the questions into our\nPodcast feet get

they're um to what was I think red will\nThis of the season for getting red wheelbarrow and she was saying now everybody be careful and don't you know take more than you need and leave the plant\nAllow the plant to stay alive for the next um the next year bait so it is only like even just things like that you know like little Facebook posts or what have you I mean it's still alive it's awareness right um\nSome guy living a sensibility of connection\nAnd you don't see the red willow as a um a resource either you are right something you just take from right and it's something you take from but you do it respectfully right and the same place of course to water\nAnd a source of life [noise]\nWonder um you mentioned the a little while ago the air that you do talk about your daughter a lot in in your poetry I Know that you know and I like I talk among my children\nYou ready to you about that because I'm not I'm not speaking for you're just speaking for yourself right but but a single voice of integrity and searching is a window in right to a world\nIn a way that often asking somebody to represent a group in fact does not um there's this part in whereas there's the part that I can write the page whereas her birth signaled the responsibility as a mother\nTo teach what it is to be like ... ... ... and I don't want to read that just like the\nOh okay see let me find it\nOK or maybe I'll read the first to the family kind of yeah OK yeah whereas\nHer birth signaled the responsibility\nAs a mother to teach what it is to be low quota there in the question\nWhat did I Know about being luckily to signal panic blood rush my embarrassment what did I Know of our language but pizza's would I teach her to be pieces\nUntil a friend comforted don't worry you and your daughter will learn together today she stood sunlight on her shoulders lean in St to share a song in\nHer father's language\nThemes she motions simultaneously with her hands I watch or be in multiple music\nAt a ceremony to honor that didn't nations first poet laureate speaker explain that each people had been given their own language to reach ways I understand\nReaching as action\nShe offered the prayer and introduction in heritage language [noise]\nAnd listen at they reach my eyes into my hands [noise]\nMy hands onto my lab\nAt the quiet page\nIn [noise] Iraq occurred that\n\n[noise] oh\n[noise]\n\nOkay this is on me a date with the poet lately on shelter\nUh [noise]\n\nThe question I'm always kind of pursuing an individual life to the way and to this question\nIs you know what what does it mean to be human [noise]\nUm I also know that that every one of our sense of that is constantly evolving across life but\nThere are some things you said about writing I find so intriguing I feel like the way you've written about them is how writing forms you as a human being like you wrote some where um it's an endeavor I go into it now provide solid deep toy [noise]\nPerhaps is George I'm writing a seated comfortably in my court because it's a life lesson that sure fight it writing has shown me what happens with patients and some place else you wrote to surprise as I've experienced in my writing practice have dislodged me from curiosity until now\n[laughter]\nI Wonder if she could write a little bit about those qualities and as a way into the question if what if you're learning about what it means to put him in to the life usually\nI'm I think the writing practice um it was something that I had not expected to be a good fit I had never thought why would it be a writer one day\nBut I went to the Institute of American indian art and um they didn't have a music program that's what I wanted to study [laughter]\nBut I really wanted to go to school there so I felt like the next best thing to study writing\nAnd um it was not easy a lot of uh I Would say the first three three and a half years\nBut I think it was that patients that it's something I've learned through writing a sense of patient\nAnd the reward that comes from that even I'm just now thinking about the peace thirty eight but that piece for example took me I Want to say maybe a year and a half to two years to write\nWhat it was important to me it's kind of it's an ethics piece it's like six pages long yeah yeah yeah what'd you just\nBriefly say what what's happening in that piece\nIn dirty yeah\nJust briefly in thirty eight it's a written to ... for the Dakotas thirty four I'm thirty eight duck with him in for Hong under the orders of on President Abraham Lincoln\nUm as a result of this to appraising\nWhich came at a time when the court to people there um territory their land was\nWas getting smaller and smaller and um and finally down to something like a ten mile tract and the people ... people did not have um hunting right beyond that\nUh and basically um and they had no a thorough credit with the traders and so they were basically starving so there was an uprising\nAnd I'm as a result um these thirty eight men were hungry and then ... ... people were moved west to South Dakota area in different um basically they lost their land\nAnd the larger things legal mess execution in us history and yes and it happened at the same week that President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation yes that is right in the tree we don't know secretary or we don't teach 'em [noise] yeah [noise]\nSo so you were just talking so this took a long to emerge trip patients writing all of that\nAbsolutely I just think um that I've learned through writing the reward and the joy\nSelf I think at least for me the imagination is something that I have to really respect like its\nOwn little person yeah [laughter] so I Can't demand too much of it sometimes they have to\nLet it take a rest and then come back and being conversation with it again but it's a beautiful process that I've learned through rating Mm yeah\n[noise] I was looking at page sixty four [noise] whereas I did not desire and childhood and also page sixty five which was another part of the way you also reflected on what an apology is like is about your experience", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On
