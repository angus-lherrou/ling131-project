Michigan and communities around the world more at MK dot org and that listeners who support this NPR's but\nGenerally avoids the lightning rod figures on this show\nBut earlier this year the University of Montana in Missoula a blue city in a red state invited on being to attempt an outside the box civil conversation between two pundits with big following on contrasting ends of the U.S political spectrum\nIt became a sold out public event in the spirit of Montana Sen Mike Mansfield who famously modeled integrity courage and humility across the partisan aisle in the tumult of the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nThe liberal lesbian contributor to Fox News she just written a book which gathered its own controversy called the opposite of hate\nSally asked to be paired with Erick Erickson she was a long time executive editor of the conservative blog red state and he's an evangelical daily drive time radio host in Atlanta he enthusiastically agreed\nSince we recorded this conversation the two of them had been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with two twelve year old girls who waited in a long line they told me that come at the insistence of a teacher and had expected to be bored\nThey were instead exhilarated\nIn the short span of time in which they've come into political awareness they told me they had not witness or imagine that this was possible\nA true back and forth marked at once by bedrock difference and goodwill and humor and a willingness to bring our questions as well as our argument our humanity as well as our positions into the room if only for an evening\nMm I'm for it and this is on being this conversation unfolded at the dentist in theater in Missoula, Montana and with co hosted by Montana Public radio [noise]\nYou know as as I uh moved through two thousand sixteen um what started being clear to me kind of midway through the air is who ever won\nUm\nThe deep work that we were going to have to do as a society was about was human work about repairing like stitching relationship across that rupture that has suddenly become on you know we could no longer not see it\nAnd that somehow that was going to involve each and every one of us wherever we were on the political or social spectrum taking some kind of stocks in terms of how we got to this place and um\nYou know Sally you uh you know you you mean you say you're a liberal like your credentials are from um\nThank you and I don't think so [laughter]\nI've worked really hard\nThat you tell a story that I found very you know and you know how you you grew up\nAt a community organizer and he said\nA lot to be a community organizing that formed a lot of people that you're political enemies or a devil [noise]\nUm and you you've worked to not be that way but in this election that all re service for you um you tell this story and I think also something that you both have in common is you're both parents are right in the thick of parenting and that's influencing how this reckoning are doing and you tell a story of being in your\nLovely leafy neighborhood block party in Brooklyn in the summer of two dozen sixteen and and there was a penny out of Donald Trump's head\nAnd you complained uncivilized [laughter]\nBut you also you also told your diet is when you got to have certain language to be heard you know\nNo one thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just trolls talking to neo Nazis and talking to a terrorist people think their motivation is fundamentally good\nBy mark\nAnd these trolls didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil or or cruel or unkind\nUm and and in fact when I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of\nBeing called things I Can't repeat on public radio and online um and they're going through real hardships in their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this is one of the things they choose to do with their time but still\n[noise] um\nNo one thinks they're mean no one thinks their hateful\nNo one wants to be careful okay how do we do with that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're meanness well the only thing I was gonna say and this is I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention\nTo their tweets which is like right now but still there were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and we've forgotten\nIt's or that could hurt you that they can make you feel that way you were feeling and then they thought they had the opportunity a lot of them apologized ... thanks but why did you then do it right and the sort of it has something to do with\nOf accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own heads and so I mean there are studies that when people have to ah\nYou know are sort of challenged to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to we behave more kindly so there's this ...\nOf technology that allows us to fuel the human condition that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of nurturing amplify it yeah yeah yeah\nI'm ... so I mean part of what I think we do is start to understand that we all have a problem\nRight and I don't look I don't I don't care who does it worse I happen to have an opinion on the matter about ah I'm actually an honest what I really think I'm curious if you agree with us Eric is I I've come to think that ah that the left by and large uh is nicer to humanity in general but not people in\nThat's\nActually something conservatives say regularly\nSo that's really interesting right and and if we can somehow figure out a way to say okay you know what like let's try to do both um but also from I think that point of recognizing at the at least at the very beginning nobody we all have a habit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other ...\nAnd we all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people\nMy liberal friday say oh they're game Trump supporters me that there's still a system there are so as long as ... I hate them [noise]\n'cause we're so hateful I hate it out I mean [laughter]\nAnd we blame the people for than expressing these used as do not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith in people's\nIntention to be good and assume I Try very hard and this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I Try very hard to assume I Try very hard to assume that you liked me in spite of some of the\nSome of the things I Know you've read in\nAnd and er and written and said about gay people I still don't assume you mean me uh well I don't I can and that and that the rest of that is sort of in the pension but it's also I I I Want to believe the best in people and it seems to me that's the gift I have to give others if I Want them to believe the best to me\nYou actually call that a daily spiritual practice yes that's it you know or I mean Eric I feel like you all have been caught and one of them are related dynamics developed a\nWhich is that the culture we've created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted likes them so but in a been a very particular instance are you said something\nI mean you said a lot of good to hear a pundit but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret you said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd um the whole chapter in the book about that one yeah yeah and um and the word ...\nOn Twitter that we were doing that or you and I said how Saturday was talked about if you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed by yet that somebody came through and it shouldn't be on ... asked Erick Erickson what are you saying that has to do with repairing civil discourse you know in\nYour voice totally made earlier that we sometimes in in what I did that it was I think two thousand nine and ... it was just I didn't know anybody but a\nCouple of dozen people on Twitter at the time and it was just friends and it wasn't my remark it was someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership of it though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since\nUm but the number of people who still bringing up because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't see there's about the right actually I wrote several weeks ago about people in the right suddenly being okay with dictatorship\nAs long as it goes their way and the common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that boost trade you really are at a disturbing point in this country where as long as their site is winning they don't care uh\nAnd I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like worker record on this but it really is where my heart is right now that it only matters when we're oblivious to the people in our city blocks\nTo the homeless people in our community when it's just national politics from Washington is the be all end all everything everything subtract because none of us are in Washington\n[noise] um I don't look I think it's very ... to point that it's dangerous to suggest the justice sort of return to prevent ... emergency it could be the solution right because we have to remember that before the Internet before\nGlobalization and global interconnectedness and global awareness we still had segregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still had all the things we had a lot of things that I think made this country great but a lot of things I think that we had to work on and that that\nProvincial as them that that especially given the historical way in which our neighborhoods have been shaped led to a a lot of my opiate so I'd say that look I have a bent on this than I Am clear on it which is that I Will never be nicer I Want everyone to hate last and I think progressive should lead the way\nTo go first\nTo like go to the points that were making here\nThat people can change and grow\nAnd in fact that is a core of progressive politics is that please don't stay where we've been as a country in the divisiveness of racial segregation\nAnd slavery and the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality we are not we\nDon't have to stay there please don't stay there let's progress that is the idea of progression that that\nDoesn't make sense it invites change in the country and in individuals and so if you if if your vision involves people changing\nAnd growing then you have to be able to literally practice what you preach and create space for people to change and\n... when you see this because I said something somewhere on the right to you know we've we've got to\nWe've got to improve we're going to be able to say we're going to reverse I and I get a lot these days will that unilateral disarmament we we can't be nicer because the other side's gonna and there's just this is absolutely use those\nWho lack of faith to believe the other side is capable of growing\nYeah I um I get it to 'em I still have friends and you know activists and organizers who feel like hate and and ... is one of the strongest tools in their toolbox [noise]\nUm [noise] you know look I just I always returned to I'm One of my favorite quotes Martin Luther king quote and he says darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that yeah hate\nIs not the answer to hate and he said hey is too great a burden to bear correct yeah and it and you can't hate your way out of ... yes\nI don't know what I Want to say liberals and I love that definition of progressive\nBut I don't think progressive have you know a corner on the market of believing in human gross and change right and and you are at a devout evangelical Christian and conversion is an important value and belief in Christianity\nUm [noise] you write about um your aunt Lucy ... and you know some and I you know what's interesting to me like I feel like everyone\nI mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives and our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological or it's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have the stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprise I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we have a quick progress\nOn gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims you know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day come out [laughter] [laughter]\nBut are there are so that you know look kids to\nGo to racially integrated elementary schools\nParticipate in racially integrated uh\nActivities and after school programs are\nActually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other but then\nHas a much more positive effect more broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually I actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask us really um [noise] as we wind down which is\nIf the goal of a robust civility is not that we agree right and that in fact uh [noise] we really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a\nA proposition is that we we're not we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called common life\nThat if it is about also just learning to disagree better with more integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at\nThat you know Sally says I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and and Eric ... yeah you said some of them were paid your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have been in Kansas there'll be on social media so so this is a work in progress for any of us we're all centers\nUm what is the experience you have a what does shift which is what becomes possible what difference does it make [noise]\n\nI um have had\nThe experience myself of\nBeing unexpectedly kind\nIn the face of\nPeople being cruel on line or off and seeing the difference it makes in yourself in for Neal better [noise] I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do 'em try it [noise]\nUm but it and then as well\nBack and say hey you're you're All right you know\nThey had the\nPrivilege of finding example after example I mean there are in credibly powerful stories of people who were you know professional hate mongers or kids who were just saying the violent racist things\nAnd who the targets of that hate showed kindness and generosity\nAnd transformed those dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they had been raised thinking we're hateful showed them kindness and I have to say I'm aware of the power of the burden\nThat in a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at the receiving end of more of the hate\nShould have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I I get that there are times where it feels daily unjust and him and in some cases it's too much to ask for long enough to Africa and the other hand this is where those of us who are yeah privileged Kennan ... step up and\nAnd also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high road I Believe in treating people like they are all extraordinary and beautiful in equal and so I Do feel like that in the that is it that is the work\nAnd I I Am blown away by the difference it makes you ...\nAlways struck um ... ... if it just ... to some degree or what is the first bad\nIn scripture but what is the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel and\nIt's not the fall the serpent in the apple it's actually in the garden of Eden before evil even ears world God says it's not good for men to be alone\nLoneliness and so many of us concoct relationships and communities on line\nAnd we're still a loan and then we get in our tribes are Republican conservatives liberal progressive Democrats will that tribes in becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle with the other\nAnd I really push myself more and more\nTo to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people you know we were with the wife who has cancer and I know we're we're running out of good years um and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are online are and not there ah\nI'm more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to have actual real friends\nAnd I don't think there's a coincidence that all related Lee\nThat we both began having these internal conversations um with having kids\nThat level of local ... and I don't mean to keep working on local here there's not a digital just community physical real break bread community ... in my book I Am a firm believer that everyone should learn to cook\nBecause you should open your home\nAnd bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know um there's a there's a great Christian author rose area Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse\nAnd she writes to the Christian Community a lot\nThat you and there is no better community in America than the gay community where an unlocked door and a warm meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide\nAnd that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we need to recognize that our blessings our blessings to be shared with every day\nFree Jesus um\nMe just it is [noise]\nUnder value in the twenty first century real community and real meals and if we get back to that I think lots of the world's problems can be solved around the dinner table with the war meal with strangers getting to know them\n[noise] and this is on today with Eric accent and Sally [noise] okay\nWe finish one minute earlier what should please something deep in my radio bonds that I'd really like to just keep going for five more minutes you've\nGot the um [noise] I don't know if this is a time France with the two of you\nRight right just because we're so fixated read from Williams for really because there's more to life and there's more to politics has more to us in politics\nAnd I'm so that puzzles me curious have with the two of you because you are in that world is that some of these things on which were so divided and went to a lot of hate gets thrown around by the extremes which we allowed to define and frame of are important discussions\nThere's this middle ground this vast middle ground where people aren't the same but you know for example I mean you know [noise]\nFor a long time at the venture that on abortion\nYou know something like sixty to sixty five percent of Americans across party lines saver you know abortion with limit now there is a big conversation to have about what those limits are but rather than always having a same fight about it's always right or it's always wrong", "show_name": "On Being", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "13"}
