it's a contribution to the larger whole to be really good at bat I'm Krista tip and this is on being [noise]\nStrangers in their own land with a finalist for the national Book Award or early ... professor emeritus at Berkeley and was born in Boston, Massachusetts so you were a child of a foreign service officer you sound like you grow up all over the world\nYeah [noise] I ah lived in Israel and from aged a twelve to fourteen very pivotal experience\nAnd then I'm New Zealand willing to New Zealand and then my folks were in Guyana and I spent a summer and gone now but by then I was in college and and they weren't Tunisia\nThis girl I was very fortunate really meant to get to experience oh that yeah oh yeah\nWas there I'm a religious or spiritual background to your childhood in your family or in\nThe places you know I Would say um my parents were a very religious Unitarian so\nAnd we have to learn to uh get to know and empathize with and you know people in radically different cultures\nI think by the time I was sixteen I had that message but I felt something missing and I got interested in the Quakers who seemed to be much more okay gang so what are we going to do about it you know ... areas were very talking [laughter]\nTalkers yet out talk talk talk of the Quakers looked like they were kind of um is it they wouldn't do\nWorse yeah well and I think you've spoken about how I'm living in that diplomatic world um you know so you are you are known within sociology is the founder of\nThe sociology of emotion and I I just want us to summarize and you tell me if I get this wrong that but she feels important I Want to really dive deep into that so that the backdrop as in terms of how we analyze\nSouth with with the ana I came to to realize that there were different truths you differently truth and so there are facts I Believe in the reality is yes\nThe deep story and again we all have the story it repel certain facts don't matter and in fights other factors would do\n[noise]\nI'm\nJust the tip at indices on being today with the esteemed sociologist at the motion our leadership [noise]\n\n\nYou know in strangers on their own\nUm take up what you call it the whole issue um to kind of go deep into what are the dynamics that collect around a specific subject and to to really understand the dynamics anytime the great paradox and um [noise]\nYou know you point at this dynamic that in a\nPart of the country you're in there as well first of all and I'm ... and beautiful natural environment and ... rate pollution and great really resistant to regulating polluters and I think that's such an example of where\nUm people from the outside of all the dynamics that go into that would say um it's just obvious\nAnd but you know there's a you know the background\nNo uh in Louisiana felt that the federal government was\nA bigger better version of local government and the truth is that in the state of Louisiana a local government out of the state government has not protected people okay from pollution\nYou know there's a there's this passage in in the book that I\nAh and strangers in their own land that I\nI just just just as an example of debts and maybe this person you're talking about you know your Harold I'm going to end to the state yeah it seems to come down on the little guy he\nNo he says his take just by you if your motor boat league's little gas into the water the warden All right you up but if companies like thousands of gallons of it and kill off of life here the state let's go\nBad example hits home it may I can see that\nYes yes the big companies are are so rich and powerful that say basically have a bond [laughter] the legislature and that number is ... ... the company's has outsourced moral charity work to the state\nSo they say okay you know let's let's get a legislature that goes along with our developed let's talk jobs jobs jobs\nAnd so the company is with the money that the state gives them and it's it I think it was one point six billion dollars that uh was in the last five years and then offer to companies yeah\nTo come in with that public money yeah it came from Texas\nI'm his aides and can make donations to the Audubon\nSociety or for a new football uniform for outlets you ... you know looking good and setting up the third grade classes and chemistry meanwhile state officials the Louisiana department of environmental quality\nIs being very weak and giving out permits a [noise]\nAs one of the people I interviewed like candy you know the state looks terrible the company looks good it's kind of emotional actual manipulation you can say to get you to feel like the company has your friend and\nThis interesting dynamic that um that again is is ... it's not something that would be obvious to anybody I mean a lot of this is true but I mean for example you um\nYou you have a chapter called there are members [noise]\nAnd there's something where you you uh decisions I made an accent and about a sociological understanding that memory just in general is an indirect expansion of power\nAnd then you say so ironically strangely embarrassingly the memory of southern environmental glory cell in part to respectful clerks and federal offices internal environmentalists\nSo much complexity there [laughter] your heart does mine yeah oh yeah yeah because the people I came\nTo know are no more about the environment they know you know which fish are in what area where do you said the crab pots where\nYou know what ducks you can shoot what period of of the year they love their land and yet and yet they're they're caught I mean people working in the plants and I talked to a woman who said\nYou know I asked do you talk to your neighbors about ah environment she said you know our neighbors working plants and\nUh I don't want to hurt their feelings I don't want them to feel accused [noise]\nYou know is this the people working the plants would take on the guilt\nRight or is it the long run out of hand and you know and again it's not their personal guilt a it's a company policy and it's a the absence of\nA regulation here's their rules here right you're right like California's very strict rules we enjoy a cleaner environment as a result it's out that level of guilt it's not a personal one right so that show was very poignant and sweet of her\nTo be mindful that you know an operator might feel with ... [noise]\nYeah [noise] and scan like poignant this whole thing gets it as well and what you are shining a light on is the human complexity here and we may\nWell that's still what reality not wishful thinking\nAnd let's talk about reality and not ... thinking by having a simple a respectful public conversation yeah you know where nobody is bullying conversation only anybody else you know you're coming together\nTo see if there can be common ground on the environment\nAnd there can be I think the people I came to know we're very interested and very approving of\nRenewables in fact there's something called the green tea moved to a Tea Party that's all for renewable\nBut we're not even finding a common ground because we aren't even respectfully reaching out to look for it right here in our bubble still in fact I I think that problem remains with us\nAnd especially on the left I think there's a kind of origin sort of it we're turning I Would say I find it very sad I think we have to reach out looking for potential common [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nAfter a short break more with our Lee ...

[noise]\nI'm Krista ... says on being today with the steamed and sociologist at the motion hardly hawk shelled [noise]\nIsn't it a poignant things I felt and throughout strangers in their own land in a time you you've spent um [noise] in Louisiana is\nAverage the Bible belt and one of the things you found which I think it's an interesting critique before you know the more the site that can also be an lightened is um [noise]\nUh that regulation\nThat a lot of the things that are coming up people that's what needs to be done in fact it's not about ... herring like not about how do we call I mean you said you know the question of how could repairs being made\nA lot of people find you know that their bibles are more useful in that sense than the government [noise] mhm\nMhm [noise] so that's a question okay what has the government dumped phew that's\nYou know maybe they will point may be a it hasn't lived up to its promise or maybe it's getting blamed for things didn't do okay let's figure that out a terrible right back full public conversation about just that [noise]\nIt is for the government kind of a in fact letting people there don't you know oh are they expecting too much of it what's the record oh let's let's talk about that and the specific yeah yeah [noise]\nYou know there's a paragraph in your book where you just ... even among the most ardent in extreme I mean I think maybe that's where the nother interview gave you said even among the most ardent extreme people you met or five years of research\nYou found specific issues on which there is potential for coalition safeguarding children on the Internet reducing prison\nThis rebuilding our rail system roads and bridges and our social infrastructure [noise] um so interesting to think about what if we started I sang a what we could start talking about tomorrow [noise]\nRight [laughter] wherever I'm hanging fruit right yeah mhm yeah that's right and do it in the in the spirit we've been talking about yeah mhm [noise]\nYou I'm In I'm strangers in their own land you're near the end do you say you write a letter to a friend on the liberal last year and you write a letter to Louisiana friends on ours you'd say ... you know if you imagine if Iraq if I had a right to my friends and lay down on the writers are right to a liberal friend I mean I there was a sentence and\nIn your letter to\nYour friends on a liberal left and I just kind of humanizing and its provocative and human way consider the possibility that endeavor situation you might end up closer to their perspective\nIt [laughter] I think I think that's true that we are products of our own experience\nAnd what if you grew up in a family um to me said oh we were poor but we didn't know what I had a great childhood but we were poor you know\nI'm OK what does that have been your experience and what if your dad's job and how much you earn was the central fact of your life\nYou know and what if it was for blue collar job but you felt put down for doing that blue collar job no [noise] I think\nThere are some thing actually missing in the entire vocabulary we have for talking about social class yeah 'cause I didn't go just to another region or torn people with different political\nViews I went to a different social class and there is a lot of nearing on the left as a at the blue collar class that lived there serious look we're the Haley workers we're\nClimbing the telephone pole to repair our telephone ... re paving roads where [noise] who are you know to put that down and there's a lot of humble pie\nCome back and be as critical of little cocoon and I've long been here as I Am kind of you know it's not only a contempt for the really bothers me whenever I hear it or see it\nUm and that is buried to some degree but there's a kind of a reluctance to to reach out it says is\nOn the left there's a lot of good political will but it's got curled up in onto itself and become a kind of self monitoring program oh you said this wrong outcome\nInstead of reaching out to build coalitions because we're a big country not ruins like us I was like them\nWhat we need our sturdy coalitions and I think labor unions when the labor movement was much larger and [noise] there there was a way that people of\nDifferent colors and classes got together and when you had a compulsory draft right right with different colors\nAnd and classes got together natural way to counter the theory on each other and you know here yeah public school systems um bought were down on those [noise]\nThose crossover connective institutions I think we need to build another one I Would like to see a civil service you know one year quieter every one\nOf the one where I've you know yeah yeah of everyone and you go to a different reach ... get to know people get first of all get to know how to\nTreat people respectfully and listen actively be immediate everybody should learn new skills and men go cross\nA to see if we can rebuild does\nThat connective tissue yeah [noise]\nI'm I'm sure people are said to you and I I I I came to this conversation myself that um\n[noise] this critique that [noise] they're all kinds of groups of people including like people of color or have a mom I felt like strangers in their own land in this country and then ran this late right and I mean is yeah yeah and\nThat you know the critiques that white people wake up to this phenomenon when it's about other white people I'm kind of you had to work with that in your mind\nIt's true and I think it's a it's an important insight [noise]\nYeah I I think it's an excellent point I mean for example the opiate addiction problem has\nHas been oh now they're cold diseases of despair\nWhich is kind of a compassionate way crack epidemic with pneumonia yeah oh whereas the crack epidemic in inner cities which blacks ah wasn't it was criminalized nine like yeah yeah that's right now in worse [noise]\nSo ... been with her it's a point that should be broadly received [noise]\nSo I Want to Joshua cloud has been just such a big wonderful conversation I'm just kind of curious about that you say somewhere that\nThe English language doesn't give us many words to describe the feeling of reaching out to someone from another world and Venice is and I ended up having at interest welcomed\nNews that some of its own kind mutual it's created I just found that intriguing 'cause I think so much about the power of words and I wonder if you had 'em or their words you're using now are you thinking are there and and branch that gets added symbols and how important that is for us and\nConstructing our world [noise]\nWell I used the word empathy and uh it's uh something we're all capable of\nAnd um we in a way to carry around a little empathy map who we should and shouldn't feel ... us and we need to we large those maps right and a shift them and so maybe there are different kinds of empathy that so [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being",
