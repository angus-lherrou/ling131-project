[noise]\nI'm Krista ... says on being today with the steamed and sociologist at the motion hardly hawk shield [noise]\nOne at a poignant things I felt and throughout strangers in their own land on his time you've spent um [noise] in Louisiana is\nAverage the Bible belt and one of the things you found which I think is an interesting critique for you know the more the side that considers itself to be an lightened is um [noise]\nUh that regulation\nAnd a lot of the things that are coming up people that's what needs to be done in fact it's not about ... herring like not about how do we call I mean you said you know the question of how could repairs being made a lot of people find you know that their bibles are more useful in that sense\nOkay what has the government done phew that's you know maybe they will point maybe ah it hasn't lived up to its promise or maybe it's getting blamed for things didn't do okay let's figure that out how to write a spectacle public conversation about just that [noise]\nIt is for the government kind of um [noise] in fact letting people they don't you know oh or they expecting too much of it what's the record oh let's let's talk about that specific yeah yeah [noise]\nThere's you know there's a paragraph in your book where you just list you say even among the most ardent an extreme I mean I think maybe this was a ... interview gave you said even among the most ardent extreme people you met or five years of research\nYou found Pacific issues on which there is potential for coalition safeguarding children on the Internet reducing prison populations for non violent offenders protecting against commercialization of the human gene I'm pushing for good jobs rebuilding our rail system roads and bridges and our social infrastructure\nI'm at so interesting to think about what if we started by saying a what we could start talking about tomorrow [noise] right [laughter] wherever I'm hanging fruit right yeah\nMhm yeah that's right and do it in the in the spirit we've been talking about yeah mhm\n[noise] you I'm In I'm strangers in their own land you near the end you say you write a letter to a friend on the liberal last you write a letter to Louisiana friends on the earth's you'd say ... you know if you imagine if Iraq if I'd a right to my friends in Louisiana and the writers are right to a liberal friend I mean I there was a sentence and\nAnd your letters to\nYour friends on a liberal left and I just kind of humanizing and its provocative and a human way consider as a possibility that in their situation you might end up closer to their perspective\nIt [laughter] I think I think that's true that we are products of our own experience\nAnd what if you grew up in a family um to me said oh we were poor but we didn't do it at a great childhood but we were poor you know um\nIt's the central fact of your life you know and what if it was for blue collar job but you felt put down for doing that to collar job no [noise]\nI think there there's something actually missing in the entire vocabulary we have for talking about social class yeah 'cause I didn't go just to another region or torn people with different political\nViews I went to a different social class and there is a lot of smearing on the left\nA at the blue collar class that Syria said look we're the daily workers we're\nClimbing the telephone pole to repair our telephone wire were re paving roads where [noise]\nWho you know to put that down and there's a lot of humble pie to each year and a I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of\nOld cocoon I've long been here as I Am and a kind of you know it's not only a contempt for the really bothers me now whenever I hear it or see it\nUm and that is buried to some degree but there's a kind of a reluctance to to reach out says if\nOn the left there's a lot of good political will but it's gotten curled up in onto itself and become a kind of self monitoring program oh you said this wrong outcome\nInstead of reaching out to build coalitions 'cause we're a big country not everyone's like us and everyone's like them\nWhat we need our sturdy coalitions that and I think labor unions when the labor movement was much larger and [noise] you know there was a way that people of\nDifferent colors and classes got together and when you had a compulsory draft right right with different colors and and classes got together and natural way it can be theory on each other then yes public school systems um bought were down on\nTo build another one I Would like to see a civil service you know one year acquired if every one of every one where a very young you know everyone can you go to a different reach and get to know people get first of all get to know how to\nTreat people respectfully and listen actively be immediate everybody should learn new skills and then go cross\nUm to see if we can rebuild does\nThat connective tissue yeah\nI'm I'm sure people are said to you and I I I I came to this conversation myself that um [noise] there's critique that there are all kinds of groups of people including like people of color I'm sure have long felt like strangers in their own land in this country\nAnd they ran this late right and yeah yeah and especially now yet again and it's when white people that you know the critique that white people wake up to this phenomenon when it's about other white\nPeople um how do you have to work with that in your mind it's true and I think that's a that's an important insight\nYes I I think it's an excellent point I mean for example the opiate addiction problem has\nHas been oh now they're called a diseases of despair\nWhich is kind of a compassionate way crack epidemic with no yeah yeah oh whereas the crack epidemic in inner cities which black uh wasn't it was criminalized behind like yeah yeah that's right now in worse [noise]\nSo and so it's a point that should be broadly received [noise]\nI Want to drop your clothes it's been just such a big wonderful conversation I'm just kind of curious about that you say somewhere that\nThe English language doesn't give us many words to describe the feeling of reaching out to someone from another world and Venice is and I ... end up having that interest welcome to me that some of its own kind mutual is created I just found that
