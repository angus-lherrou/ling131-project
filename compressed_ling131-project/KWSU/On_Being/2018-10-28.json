was at thirty year old American traveling in India which the smell of incense in my hair and monstrous repeating and my ears\nBack then if you had told me that I Would someday be training employees have corporate America to apply contemplative practices to help them become more successful I would've said you'd been standing too long in India is hot new age son [noise]\nYet as soon as nearby Bush return to the U.S in Nineteen Seventy three she started a company called elimination and was featured among site a young Steve Jobs and Fortune Magazine\nMore recently she helped create Google's wildly popular employee program search inside yourself nearby Bush is called in to work with educators and judges and social activists and soldiers\nHer odyssey from India ten now tells a defining narrative of our time and it's not just the story of tools that help them be more successful it's a rediscovery and reclaiming of contemplation in many forms and many tradition and secular as modern life\nIn the beginning and you couldn't ever say what the environmental leaders called the L Word and limit the L Word with love and it's really when\nSomeone's heart open that things really change I had been more and more willing to take the risk to offer those practices even in just very secular working situations recently than I used\nTo be because people really want to look at during [laughter] and um it always edges on sounding like a hallmark card\nBut I have tended to be very powerful if you can find the right way to do it [noise]\nI'm Krista ... and this is I'm being\nShe's just written a new book together with ROM DOS walking each other home conversations on loving and dying we spoke anti that um Fifteen so I Wonder how would you start to describe what the spiritual background of your child pedophile life early life\nWell my early life [noise] I was brought up Catholic and when I was seven my father left and my mother had to go to work and it was right after the war I say the second\nWorld [laughter] and you have to be the war [laughter] and\nUm [noise] there wasn't daycare so my mother would drop me off at the church and I'd go to mass every morning and then I just go right over to the school they were both across the street from us so I was in church every morning\nFor my whole childhood\nAnd um I think you know the conflict children are\nPart of the way morals and ethics are taught is through the models of the lives of the St right so there are a lot of really pretty extraordinary and some preposterous story of St [laughter] but I really loved I'm Joan of arc\nThat an interesting idea that Joan of and so I'm just going to have it at Joan of arc and by the aspirations of a girl in Madison New Jersey [laughter]\nWell ruined her life is a lot more interesting than mine [laughter] I don't I I I liked that but you did start out as a kind of ordinary little girl and then\nThe basics are that she started hearing God talking to her and telling her what to do and and the little girl and you know recognizing how confusing life is\n[laughter] right [laughter] ah [laughter] so\nBut I was just just committed as everybody else to finding a way to bring that into um our lives in the west so\nFirst I started a business with my then husband John Bush and I was an elimination and yeah yeah but what I was most interested in women nations was integrating this sense\nNot just practice because not everybody who worked there wanted to learn to meditate but we integrated in ways into the business that would embodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice and who knows\nYou know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know it's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more complicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but\nAt the time that was radical yeah so we really want to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words\nAs you can appreciate [laughter] yeah so I ...\nRight livelihood where what you're making is wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the species and\nAnd at the same time the way in which you're doing is helping everyone who's involved to wake up [noise] interestingly we did so many things that when I many years later\nArrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there where their engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that they recognized about what makes a person more creative more able to ah bring their their whole settled into work and to be able to grow\nFrom their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\n[laughter] right [noise] that is a shaft that is still a still has a long\nWay to go oh for sure in terms of American corporate culture and\nIdeals and practicality is a story of search inside yourself first of all I I I Love the story of how you that you had to find\nThat language I mean isn't it right when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't\nTake [noise] yeah [noise] uh\nActually my friend Ming who's now written a book um search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the rich still running the center for contempt of mine\nAnd he called up and first of all he said when I was younger he been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him so he'd been thinking for some time at Google\nThat or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was engineering number one o seven [laughter] and um when Google went public they told their engineers said who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to\nUm [noise] that they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way\nAdvanced Google's mission\nBut they could decide but it was so man decided it was going to be bringing meditation and he said I posted it\nWent out there and we talk to and we looked around and what we identified was that people ... employees there are\nAll quite young very smart graduated the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise]\nHad been in front of their screens most of their lives so I'm after talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there I suggested that we could offer the same practices but emphasize the practices that\nThat more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could frame and then a different way and so we called it of course they came up with this great name since they're the big search engine search inside yourself\nAnd then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress reduction and we asked Danny ... who also is in bug guy with us back all those great guy\nI'm asked him to give a talk at Google about the relation between about why emotional intelligence so important in the workplace and on the relationship between meditation and Marshall intelligence he did that and then we ... the course\nAnd in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up [laughter] and since then you know over two thousand Google airs around the world have taken the course and\nThere's a lot of talk now about bringing mindfulness into the workplace yeah how's superficial it is and how it helps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people questioned anything it just makes them more satisfied with what they're doing\nBut this is a serious course and when you sit down and quiet down come calm quiet stable\nYou have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise and you do feel better usually although sometimes\nYou know really disturbing emotions rise but it needs to be taken\nTo the next kind of level of gaps in order for people to begin to question right higher\nBut this course actually offers enough time practice and a teaching to help people do that\n[noise] I mean yeah and I think that's an important and refreshing thing to name\nOfficial and it can be abused like any like any spiritual practice like you know political correct us um [noise]\nBut you know nearby something that really so intrigues me and I'm In your work and in some of your writing is how you know like the language of emotional intelligence that you've just been using and that's now so widely familiar including workplace or um [noise]\nThat what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has [noise]\nYou know has this very noble lineage um [noise] you know it's what is um that is a tradition that has focused on for thousands of years but you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again it's a very root of judgment character and will\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was ... but that is the intention right of young voters and that's just quite amazing and then\nIn the seventies you had a somebody who actually I had never heard of David McClelland\nYeah and William James hall [noise] um who became a teacher to all these figures have gone on especially in narrow science to open up as you know David Sanger Daniel Goldman cliffs Aaron mark Epstein\nAnd also to me what's fascinating is that he was Quaker and there's something in your work there is to stretch you've pulled through in seeing that this contemplative\nImpulse is a kind of human tradition as much as it is in their religious traditions I'm In ... founder Owen cs Lewis and the idea of holding that goes back to play down high tech are somehow that you're just looking at your work has brought all that forward for me and it's really\nReally young so much [laughter] I'm honored [laughter] yeah but\nTo true when we started the center for can jump out of mind\nWe uh we're looking for ways in which these practices might be helpful and sectors of American society other than health inhaling which is where it started and um we interviewed eighty people we identify\nNew a number of people in different fields who are beginning to integrated into their work or their organizations and we interviewed eighty people and we ask them for what practices they were there's and that they were teaching or [laughter]\nAnd um we gathered these I don't know hundred practices from all the different traditions it I mean all the religious and spiritual and of course psychological traditions to they are human practices they really about\nWaking up to who we are appreciating currently are opening our\nHearts are recognizing compassion recognizing\nThat you know there's a way in which there's much that we all share even with all of our differences and waking up to that can happen through these practices so we created on called the tree of contemporary to practice his son the website for\nUm I don't think we do as much of that [laughter] teaching these students are also we at the end of the day we did that the yoga and in a deep relaxation and um of course they weren't allowed\nTo use their phones during the day but his son did shovel off in a deep relaxation and everyone who's ever done a yoga class you know none of it's like okay that was the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know\n[laughter] as soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three brats thin and I saw these\nArm's reach out [laughter] I'm sure their phones and about lying down\n[laughter] All right All right they brought their phones in front of their [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and ... [laughter] ... right [laughter] right\n[noise] well okay so and you get all that beautiful workers Google and Google is part of the problem here to the point that nothing is pure and um but you have written about and it's very\nPractical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what do you talk about that yeah that's really interesting\nYeah yeah um we divide that at Google loves that she\nPut it in her magazine um I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices if it's so simple and we don't do it\nUm you just type out your email either a response or an initiating email and then you stop takes three depressed follow your bass in\nAnd out in and out [noise] and in and out and then you read the email\nYou read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on an emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be advocates\nOr maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever we asked them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send\nAnd the first time we we did it there was a week and between the classes and so a week later they came back and I said how did it go and um [noise] they all said that was radical\nYou know [laughter] I can only using and then one guy said I did something really radical I said what is that I picked up the phone [laughter]\nYou know I mean there we all are emailing to the people on the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful really helpful I wanted to go back for a minute because I didn't answer your question about\nSocial justice activism really ... I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger will I lose my motivation right and\nIt's my anger that keeps me working for this change\nWhat what mindfulness compassion practices others help with\nIs the understanding that it's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to notice your anger begin by noticing this sensations in your body\nAnd then notice what your anger is see it and recognize it as energy energy in your body but at the same time holds a compassion and echoing immunity for the situation because\nYou're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger because it causes your mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate acquaintance many and compassion for the situation\nYou're much more likely to both the interesting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it and communicate it\nSo interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental [laughter] it's I mean we we laugh\nBut it's yeah you know it they will lawyers worry that can they be a devil's advocate for their client and the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men\nIs not eliminating wise discernment it's\nEliminating pre judgment so the day judges are unbelievably overworked they had so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know\nSome young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name\nI'm already thinking that this was probably who he is and what he's done right and they can't not have that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff\nBut they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them but it's really hard so just being there and really listening to what's actually being said\nThat can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and\nThey loved it oh yeah I just read in a a science magazine that the present moment as we experienced it as a two to three seconds long\nKind of interesting very physically like what we experience at a press among others to yeah and also that you can that it can be a longer\nRight which I thought yes I meditate or have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also completely not be there can be yeah [noise]\n\nI'm going to tip and this is on being today with what the teacher mirror by Bush who works at the intersection of industry social hailing and diverse contemplative practice [noise]\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with mindfulness\nAnd uh and I have to say like for myself I have um [noise]\nI've had many experiences across the years on different settings retreat settings or something less intense we're having the irony is that uh [noise]\nEven I kind of one off contemplative experience can be instantaneously gratifying right it can be just transformative and now they're safe and all this science about how good it is for us on these very basic biological levels and stress and all of that\nBut it's very hard to\nCreate this habit and has been hard for me I I have recently I wanted to ask you about that since I have you [noise]\nYou know I decided that I could do six minutes in the morning while my teeth dates which just seems so pathetic but yeah it's and it's our time yeah [noise]\nAnd I wonder um I Want to ask you they she worked with so many different practices I mean are there is this something where you really do have to find the way that works for you yeah well at\nThe center we we've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered you know we've had a Buddhist teacher and a Jewish teacher teaching traditional Jewish practices brother David teaching Christian practices um\nSomeone doing soupy chanting we've done it that way and then invite people to find something from all of that that works for them sometimes we've offered really simple\nPractices like um mindfulness of the breads and walking meditation right and my listening and so on\nAs an opening for people and then knowing that if they begin to appreciate the began to appreciate the inner life\nAnd the benefit that comes from as you said I mean it's amazing that they found the reduction in stress and cortisol levels after ten Fifteen minutes of meditation\nOr that once people begin to experience that that they will find what works for them the other thing I wanted to say is that there's so much work being done with mindfulness and that is a great introductory practice but when I have", "show_name": "On Being", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "28"}
