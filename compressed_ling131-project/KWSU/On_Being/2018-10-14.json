L P with officers in the U.S Europe and China ... advisors entrepreneur investors financial institutions in established companies around the world where innovation meets the law\nWe generally avoids the lightning rod figures on the show\nBut earlier this year the University of Montana in Missoula a blue city in a red state invited on being to attempt an outside the box civil conversation between two pundits with big followings on contrasting ends of the U. S. political spectrum\nIt became a sold out public event in the spirit of Montana Sen Mike Mansfield who famously modeled integrity courage and humility across the partisan aisle in the two months of the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWe first reached out to CNN commentator Sally Khan who for several years was best known as the liberal lesbian contributor to Fox News\nShe just written a book which gathered its own controversy called the opposite of hate\nSally asked to be paired with Erick Erickson he was a long time executive editor of the conservative blog red state and he's an evangelical daily drive time radio host in Atlanta he enthusiastically agreed\nSince we recorded this conversation to two of them have been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with two twelve year old girls who waited in a long line they told me that come at the insistence of a teacher and had expected to be bored\nThey were instead exhilarated\nIn the short span of time in which they've come into political awareness they told me they had not witnessed or imagine that this was possible\nA true back and forth marked at once by bedrock different and goodwill and humor and a willingness to bring our questions as well as our argument our humanity as well as our positions into the room if only for an evening\nMm I'm Christian timid and this is on being this conversation unfolded at the dentist in theater in Missoula, Montana and with co hosted by Montana Public radio\n[noise] you know as as\nWho ever won um\nThe deep work that we were going to have to do as a society it was about was human work about repairing like stitching relationship across that rupture that has suddenly become on you know we could no longer not see it\nAnd that somehow that was going to involve each and every one of us wherever we were on the political or social spectrum\nTaking some kind of stock in terms of how we got to this place and um\nYou know Sally you ah you know you you mean you have to say you're a liberal like your credentials are from\nUm thank you and I don't think I [laughter]\nI've worked really hard I yeah\nThat you tell a story that I found very you know and you're you know how you you grew up\nIn a community organizer and you know if you said that you know right wing or is more than my enemies and I hated them and you even grow up in a kind of ... up with a philosophy of community organizing that formed a lot of people that you're political enemies or devil [noise]\nUm and you you've worked to not be that way but in this election that all re service for you um you tell this story and I think also something that you both have in common is you're both parents are right in the thick of parenting and that's influencing how this reckoning you're doing and you tell a story of being in your\nLovely leafy neighborhood block party and Brooklyn in the summer of two dozen sixteen and and there was a penny out of Donald Trump's head\nAnd you\nComplained uncivilized [laughter]\nNo one thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just trolls talking to neo Nazis and talking to terrorists people think their motivation is fundamentally good by mark\nAnd these trolls didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil war or cruel or unconscious\nUm and and in fact\nWhen I heard some of their stories I was so struck but here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of being called things I Can't repeat on public radio online\nUm and they're going through real hardships\nIn their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with\nTheir time but still [noise] um no one thinks they're mean no one thinks their hateful no one wants to be careful\nOkay how do we do with that what do we do about that because we are we're meanness well the only thing I'll just say and this is I think part of it and they also\nDidn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which is like right now but still they were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and read forgotten it's\nOr it could hurt you that they make you feel the way you were feeling and then\nThey had the opportunity a lot of them apologize and all that thanks but why did you then do it right and it's sort of it has something to do with a lack of accountability\nSo I mean there are studies that when people have to uh you know are sort of challenged to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to we behave more kindly to there's this ...\nOf technology that then allows us to fuel dehumanization that you're exactly right credit didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of nurturing an ambulance by it yeah yeah I'm\n... so I mean part of what I think we do is start to understand that we all have a problem\nRight and I don't look I don't I don't care who does it worse I happen to have an opinion on the matter about uh I'm actually unemployed I really think I'm curious if you agree with Eric is I've come to think that uh that the left\nBy and large uh is nicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity and [noise]\nThat's\nActually something conservatives say regularly\nSo that's really interesting right and and if we can somehow figure out a way to say okay you know what like let's try to do both um but also I think that point of recognizing at the at least at the very beginning nobody we all have a habit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other ... and\nWe all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people my liberal friday say oh they're game Trump supporters me that there's still a system there are so wonderful but can I hate them [noise]\nBecause they're so hateful I hate it out I mean [laughter]\nAnd we blame the people for than expressing needs used as though not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith in people's\nIntention to be good and assume I Try very hard and this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I Try very hard to assume I tried very hard to assume that you like to me\nSpite of some of the but in spite of some of the things I Know you've written in and and they're in a written and said about gay people I still don't assume you\nAttention but it's also I I Want to believe the best in people and it seems to me that's the gift I have to give others if I Want them to believe the best of me\nYou you actually call that a daily spiritual practice I guess that's it you know or I mean Eric I feel like you all have been caught and one of their related dynamics throughout this\nWhich is that the culture we create that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted like fan so but in a been a very particular instance her you said something\nI mean you said a lot of us here at times it but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret you said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm wrote a whole chapter in the book about that one yes yes and um\nAnd there were goat was an adult yet and I've had to talk too much when I wrote about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was to talk to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed them ... yet that\nSomebody came through and you know and it shouldn't be on ... ask Erick Erickson what are you saying that has to do with repairing civil discourse\nYour words only made earlier that we sometimes in in when I did that it was I think two thousand nine and it was just I didn't know anybody but a\nCouple of dozen people on Twitter at the time and it was just friends and it wasn't my remark it was someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership of it though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since\nUm but the number of people who still bringing up because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't see there's about the rights\nActually our route several weeks ago about people in the right suddenly being okay with dictatorship as long as it goes their way\nAnd the common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that both sides really are at a disturbing point in this country where as long as their site is winning they don't care uh\nAnd I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like work a record on this but it really is where my heart is right now that it only matters when we're oblivious to the people in our city blocks to the ...\nEverything's obstruct because none of us are in Washington [noise] um\nYou know look I think it's very ...\nTwo points it's it's dangerous to suggest the justice sort of return to prevent ... it could be the solution right because we have to remember that before the Internet before globalization and global interconnectedness and global awareness we\nStill had segregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still had all the things we had a lot of things that I think made this country great but a lot of things I think that we had to work on and that that provincial as um that that especially given the historical way in which our neighborhoods have been shaped\nLed to a a lot of my opiate so I'd say that look I have a bent on this and I I'm clear on it which is that I Will never be nicer I Want everyone to have less and I think progressive should lead the way\nTo go first\nTo like look to the points that were making here or if there was a sign that the professors\nUm that people can change and grow\nAnd in fact that is a core of progressive politics is that please don't stay where we've been as a country in the divisiveness of\nRacial segregation and slavery and the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality\nWe are not we don't have to stay there please don't stay there let progress that is the idea of progression that that didn't make sense it invites change in the country and an individual and so if you if if your vision involves people changing\nAnd growing then you have to be able to literally practice what you preach and create space for people to change in ...\nWhen you say this because I said something somewhere on the right that you know we we've got to\nWe've got to improve we can improve the others are we going to reverse I and I get a lot these days we'll that's unilateral disarmament we we can't be nicer because the other side's gonna and there's just the it absolutely is this\nLack of faith to believe the other side is capable of growing\nI um I get it to 'em I still have friends and you know activists and organizers who feel like hate and and ... is one of the strongest tools in their toolbox\nLuther King quote and he says darkness cannot drive out darkness only light\nCan do that yeah hate is not the answer to hate and he said hey is too great a burden to bear correct yeah and it and you can't hate your way out of ... yeah I don't know what\nI Want to say liberals and I love that definition of progressive\nBut I don't think progressive have you know a corner on the market of believing in human gross and change right and and you are at a devout evangelical Christian and conversion is an important value and belief in Christianity\nNo one's going to pick your side it's by definition and arguments of the other person you're arguing with who's going to pick their side and and then the whole thing breaks down and everybody leaves feeling pretty crummy about things and so the extent to which we can keep things conversational and also that if you want to persuade someone else\nYou have to be open to being persuaded yourself these are two way street they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else to say [noise] um\nI don't look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives in our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological or it's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have these stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprised I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we that's quick progress\nOn gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims you know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day coming out of the country so [laughter]\nBut are there are studies that look kids to go to\nRacially integrated elementary schools ... grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated\nSchool programs are\nActually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other but then how much more positive effect\nMore broadly Mm mhm [noise] actually I actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask me um [noise] as we wind down which is if the goal of a robust civility is not that we agree right and that in fact uh [noise]\nWe really do have some deep deep difference where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a proposition is that we we're not we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist\n[noise] when we're integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at this you know Sally\nSays I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and and Eric ... yeah you said some of them were paid your book you know you said the need for a relationship in communities why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have been in can still be on social media so\nSo this is a work in progress for any of us we're all centers um what is the experience you have of what does shift what shifts what becomes possible what difference does it make [noise]\n\nI um\nHave had the experience myself of\nBeing unexpectedly kind\nIn the face of people being cruel on line or off\nAnd seeing the difference it makes in yourself him up for it and I feel better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do 'em try it\nBut in in them as well mhm uh people\nWrite back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like a\nI\nHad the privilege of finding example after example I mean there are in credibly powerful stories\nOf people who were you know professional hate mongers or kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things\nAnd who the targets of that hate showed kindness and generosity\nAnd transformed those dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movement because the people who they had been raised thinking we're hateful showed them kindness\nAnd I have to say I'm aware of the power of the burden that in a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps it is\nShould have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I get that there are times where it feels deeply unjust and a man in some cases it's too much to add to it I have to hand this is where those of us who are yeah privileged Kennan ... step up and\nAnd also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high road I Believe in treating people like they are all\nExtraordinary and beautiful in equal and so I Do feel like that is the that is it that is the work\nAnd I I Am blown away by the difference it makes\nYou ... I'm always struck um ... if it just riddles to some degree or what is the first bad\nIn scripture but what is the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel and\nIt's not the fall the serpent in the apple it's actually in the garden of Eden before evil even ears the world God says it's not good for men to be alone\nThat's the first bad loneliness and so many of us concoct relationships and communities on line\nAnd we're still alone\nAnd then we get in our tribes are Republican conservatives liberal progressive Democrat will that tribes in becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle with the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other and it's a lot easier to believe the other is the enemy\nAnd I really push myself more and more\nTo to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people and you know we went with a wife who has cancer and I know we're we're running out of good years um and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are online are and not there ah\nI'm more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to have actual real friends\nAnd I don't think there's a coincidence that all related Lee\nThat we both began having these internal conversations um with having kids um that level of local ... and I don't mean to keep her in a local here that's not a digital just community physical real break bread community ... in my book\nOur home and bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know um there's a there's a great Christian author reserve Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse and she writes to the Christian Community a lot that you know there is no better community in America the gay community\nWhere an unlocked door in a warm meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide and that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we need to recognize that are ... are blessed to be shared with me\nFree Jesus um\nMe just it is [noise]\nWe under value in the twenty first century were you community and real meals and if we get back to that I think lots of the world's problems can be solved around the dinner table with the war meal with strangers getting to know them\n[noise] I'm just on being today with Eric Ericson and Sally [noise] okay we\nCould finish one minute early which would please something deep and my radio bones but I'd really like to get can we just keep going for five more minutes you're better\nDon't know if this is uh just want to\nBring up with the two of you and in this room that very much in my mind it\nStill happy we haven't talked about the White House tonight right just because we're so fixated ride from Williams for I don't really because there's more to life and there's more to politics has more to us than politics\nAnd um some puzzles me and I'm curious about the two of you because you are in that world is that so many of these things on which were so divided in which a lot of hate gets thrown around by the extremes which we allowed to define and frame of are important discussions\nThere's this middle ground is a vast middle ground where people aren't the same but you know for example I mean you know", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "Pullman", "day": "14"}
