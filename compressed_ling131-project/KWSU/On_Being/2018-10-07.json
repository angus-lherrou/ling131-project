always kind of personally [noise] and every individual life is it on my end to this question [noise]\nEvery one of our sense of that is constantly evolving across life but there are some things you've set about writing I find so intriguing I feel like the way you've written about them is how writing forms you as a human being like you wrote somewhere um it's an endeavor I go into a now provides a solid deep joy [noise]\nPerhaps the story from writing as she did comfortably in my court because of a life lesson it provided writing has shown me what happens with patients\nAnd someplace else you wrote the surprise as I've experienced in my writing practice have dislodged me from curiosity into love [laughter] I Wonder if you could say a little bit about those qualities and other way into the

really really really bad bad bad poems like really dry it took me a long time\nBut I think it was that patient that is something I've learned through writing a sense of patients and their reward uh-huh that comes from not\nEven I'm just now thinking about the peace thirty eight but that piece for example took me\nI Want to say maybe a year and a half to two years to write what it was
