from NPR stations other contributors include Carnegie Corporation of New York supporting innovations in education democratic engagement and be advancements\nIn Nineteen Seventy two married by Bush writes I was at thirty year old American traveling in India with the smell of incense in my hair and monstrous repeating and my ears\nBack then if you had told me that I Would someday be training employees of corporate America to apply contemplative practices to help them become more successful\nI would've said you'd been standing too long in India the hot new and a son [noise]\nYet as soon as nearby Bush return to the U.S in Nineteen Seventy three she started a company called elimination and which featured among site a young Steve Jobs and Fortune Magazine more recently she helped create Google's wildly popular employee program search inside yourself\nNearby Bush is called in to work with educators and judges and social activists and soldiers her\nOdyssey from India ten now tells a defining narrative of our time and it's not just a story of tools that help them be more successful it's a rediscovery and reclaiming of contemplation in many forms and many traditions and secular stick of modern life\nIn the beginning and you couldn't ever say what the environmental leaders one called the L Word and [laughter] limit the L Word with love and it's really when\nSomeone's heart open that things really change I had been more and more willing to take the risk to offer those practices even in just very secular working situation recently than I used to be\nBecause people really want to repeat it turns out [laughter] and I'm always edges on sounding like a hallmark card\nBut I have found it to be very powerful if you can find the right way to do it [noise]\nI'm Krista tip it and this is on being nearby Bush's co founder and former director of the center for contemplative mind in society she's just written a new book together with ROM DOS walking each other home conversations on loving and dying we spoke into that I'm Fifteen\nSo I Wonder how would you start to describe what the spiritual background of your childhood of your life or early life for\nWhen I was seven my father left and my mother had to go to work and it was right after the war I say the second\nWorld [laughter] and you have to be the war and um\n[noise] there wasn't daycare so my mother would drop me off at the church and I'd go to mass every morning and then I just go right over to the school they were both across the street from us so I was in church every morning for my whole childhood\nAnd um I think you know the conflict children are\nPart of the way morals and ethics are taught is through the models of the lives of the same rights so there were a lot of really pretty extraordinary and some preposterous story the saints [laughter] but I really loved I'm Joan of arc\nThat an interesting idea that Joan of and so I just read a hat is Joan of arc and by the aspirations of a girl in Madison New Jersey [laughter]\nOver wanting her life is a lot more interesting than mine [laughter] I I I liked that but she did start out as a kind of ordinary little girl and then\nThe basics are that she started hearing God talking to her and telling her what to do and I'm a little girl and ... you know recognizing how confusing life is\nSo but I was just as committed as everybody else to finding a way to bring this into um our lives and the west so\nFirst I started a business with my then husband John Bush and ... and yeah yeah I thought when I was most interested in women nations was integrating sense\nNot just practice because not everybody who work there wanted to learn to meditate but we integrated and ways into the business that would embodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice I don't know [noise]\nYou know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know it's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more complicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but\nAt the time that was radical yeah so we really want to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words\nAs you can appreciate now so I ... nations we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east right livelihood where what you're making\nIs wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the species and [noise] and at the same time the way in which you're doing it is helping everyone who's involved to wake up\nMany years later arrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there where their engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that they recognized about what makes a person more creative more able to ah bring their their whole settled into work and to be able to grow\nFrom their work as well and not think of it as\nYou know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\n[laughter] right [noise] that is the shaft that is still a still has a long\nWay to go oh for sure in terms of American corporate culture\nAnd ideals and practicality a story of search inside yourself\nFirst of all I I I Love the story of how you that you had to find that language I mean isn't it right when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't take [noise] yeah [noise]\nUh actually my friend Ming who's now written a book on search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for contempt of mine\nAnd he called up and first of all he said when I was younger he been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him so\nHe'd been thinking for some time at Google that or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was engineering number one o seven [laughter]\nAnd um when Google went public they told their engineers sat who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to\nUm [noise] that they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way\nAdvanced Google's mission\nBut they could decide what it was so men decided it was going to be bringing meditation and shut I posted it\nAnd nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help so I went out there and we talk to and we looked around and what we identified was that people are employees there are\nAll quite young very smart [noise]\nGraduated the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise] had\nFor a whole day and figuring out what was going on there [laughter] I suggested that we could offer the same practices but emphasize the practices that that more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could framing and a different way\nAnd so we called it of course they came up with this great name since they are the big search engine search inside yourself\nAnd then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress reduction and we asked Danny go home and who also was an bug guy with us back all those years right right\nI'm asked him to give a talk at Google about the relation between about why emotional intelligence so important in the workplace and uh the relationship between meditation and Marshall intelligence he did that and then we posted the course\nAnd in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up and since then you know over two thousand Google lawyers around the world have taken the course and there's a lot of talk now about\nBringing mindfulness into the workplace and how how's superficial it is and how it\nHelps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question anything it just makes them more satisfied with what they're doing\nBut this is a serious course and when you sit down and quiet down can calm quiet staple you have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise and you do feel better usually although sometimes\nYou know really disturbing emotions rise but it needs to be taken to the next kind of level of gaps in order for people to begin to question right higher\nBut this course actually offers enough time practice and a teaching to help people do that\nI mean yeah and I think that's an important and refreshing thing to name that if you can be a great meditate or and also remained narcissistic right [laughter] yeah I mean listen I just can be superficial and it can be abused it's like any like any spiritual practice like yeah political correctness um [noise]\nBut you know nearby something that really selling treats me in um in your work and in some of your writing is how you know like the language of ...\n[noise] that what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has\nHas is faring noble lineage um [noise] you know it's what is that is the tradition that has focused on for thousands of years but you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back I'm Wondering attention over and over again it's a very root of judgment character and well\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was with us but that is the intention right have yeah that is the end and that's just quite amazing and then\nIn the seventies you had a somebody who actually I had never heard of David McClelland\nYeah in William James hall [noise] um who became a teacher to all these figures have gone on especially in narrow science to open up as you know David than Daniel Goldman cliffs Aaron mark Epstein\nAnd also to me what's fascinating is that he was Quaker and they have something in your work to stretch you've pulled through and seeing that this contemplative\nImpulse is kind of human tradition as much as it is in their religious traditions I'm In ... center Owen cs Lewis ... the idea of holding that goes back to play down high tech are somehow that you're just looking at your work has brought all that forward for me and it's really\nCrazy man so much [laughter] I'm honored [laughter] but\nIt's true when we started the center for contempt of mind we uh we're looking\nFor ways in which these practices might be helpful and sectors of American society other than health inhaling which is where it had started\nAnd um we interviewed eighty people we identify this isn't Ninety six and seven so it was early but we kind of word of mouth heard and knew\nA number of people in different fields who were beginning to integrated into their work or their organizations and we interviewed eighty people and we ask them for\nWhat practices they were there's and that they were teaching or [noise]\nAnd um we gathered these I don't know hundred practices\nGo traditions to they are human practices they really about waking up to who we are appreciating who we are opening our\nHearts are recognizing compassion recognizing that you know there's a way in which\nThere's much that we all share even with all of our differences and waking up to that can happen through these practices so we created on called the tree of contemplative practice is on the website\n[laughter] as soon as like breathing\n[laughter] sure their phones in front lying down\n[laughter] All right they brought their phones in front of their [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and ... [laughter] ... right [laughter] right\nWell okay so I knew were denied oh beautiful workers Google and Google is part of the problem here to the point that nothing is ... and um but you have written about ...\nSherry practical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what do you talk about that yeah that's really ...\nYeah yeah um we devised that at Google upset she\nPut it in her magazine um I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it\nUm [noise] you just type out your email either a response or and initiate an email and then you stop takes three depressed folly or pass\nIn and out in and out [noise] and in and out and then you read the email\nAnd you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be agitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion\nOr maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are\nWhat whatever we asked them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send\nAnd the first time we we did it it was a week in between a classic and so a week later they came back and we said how did it go\nAnd um they all said that was radical you know I can only using and then one guy said I did something really radical I said what is that I picked up the phone [laughter]\nYou know I mean there we all are emailing to the people on the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful really helpful I wanted to go back for a minute 'cause I didn't\nOne theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger will I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change\nWhat what mindfulness compassion practices and others help with\nIs the understanding that it's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to notice your anger begin by noticing this sensations in your body\nAnd then notice what your anger is see it and recognize it as energy energy in your body right but at the same time [noise] holds a compassion and echoing in many for the situation because\nYou're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger because it caused a mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate equity and compassion for the situation\nYou're much more likely to boats the interesting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it I communicated\nWe did a lot of work with lawyers and judges and yeah that was I was reading about that one asking about that are so interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental\n[laughter] it's I mean we we laugh but it can't you know if they were lawyers worry that can they be uh zealots advocate for their client and the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case [noise] and um of course the answer is yes\nAnd what that means and what those judges men\nIs not eliminating wise discernment it's\nEliminating pre judgment southern day judges are unbelievably overworked\nThey have so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know some young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking\nNot having that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff\nBut they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them but it's really hard so just being there and really listening to what's actually being said\nThat can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and they loved it\nOh yeah I just read in a a science magazine that the present moment as we experienced it as a two to three seconds long\nKind of interesting great like physically like what we experienced as a president weather's too yeah and also that you can that it can be a longer\nRight which is all you meditate or have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also completely not be there can be the uh [noise]\n\nI'm going to tape it and does his on being today with putting teacher mirror by Bush who worked at the intersection of industry social healing and diverse contemplative practice [noise]\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with mindfulness and contemplative practice [noise]\nSo obvious and in some ways easy but we don't do it and uh and I have to say like for myself I have um [noise]\nI've had many experiences across the years on different settings retreat settings or something less intense we're having the irony is that uh [noise] even a kind of one off contemplative experience can be instantaneously\nGratifying right\nIt can be just transformative and now they're asleep and all this science about how good it is for us on these very basic biological levels and stress and all of that but it's very hard to\nCreate this habit and has been hard for me I I have recently I wanted to ask you about that since I have you [noise]\nYou know I recently decided that I could do six minutes in the morning while my teeth deep which just seem so pathetic but\nAn SUV she worked with so many different practices I mean are there is this something where you really do have to find their way that works for\nYou yeah well at the center we we've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered [noise]\nYou know we've had a Buddhist teacher and a Jewish teacher teaching traditional Jewish practices brother David teaching Christian practices um\nSomeone doing soupy chanting we've done it that way and then\nInvite people to find something from all of that that works for them sometimes we've offered really simple practices like um my ... breads and walking meditation right and Michael listening and so on\nAs an opening for people and then knowing that if they begin to appreciate that began to pre shade the inner life\nAnd the benefit that comes from as you said I mean it's amazing that they found the reduction in stress and cortisol levels after ten Fifteen minutes of meditation\nOr that once people begin to experience that that they will find what works for them the other thing I wanted to say is that there's so much work being done with mindfulness and that is a great introductory practice\nBut when I have found in the beginning you couldn't ever say what the uh environmental leaders called the L Word and they didn't mean lesbian meant [laughter] limits the L Word with love\nAnd there are practices and most used is the love and kindness practice their mind sharing Salzburg Israeli written a lot about and the compassion practices are related to that in which you're more about appreciation for others and a desire to relieve the suffering of others", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city":
