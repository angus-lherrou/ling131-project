{"month": "10", "state": "WA", "station": "KWSU", "content": "Wrapped up one round of testing and I'm so far we've got basically to the entire year of the game developer in terms of like having a first draft of a novel we got all the chapters in place and our refining that and trying to make it better and better start the it's a big sense of relief\nBecause we know what the ending is and now it's just about making it better but I certainly will be story for all the time scale of it yeah that's right so each game as a a month\nThat sort of like building chapters out as you're writing a novel and now that we've got the whole arc of the game figure it out we can just go back and knowing what the end it's like we can try to make all the games kind of reinforce that ending\nThis whole with tens of thousands of people in it will qualities and some real work will begin will happen to know tonight that very important part of our developing process we're going to be meeting up with some play doctors in a conference room in a hotel at some secret location\nOr playing through these in three and I'll be watching us I Know that in hand [noise]\nReally seeing how the out of the box experience works how their first games work and I'll be doing that for about twelve hours over the weekend I'm\nAt the Knight it's going to be two couples to a poor player game we recruited them off the Internet or you can Twitter\nBecause people I Do not know I've never met weeks to get a lot of submissions were very fortunate in that regard you kind of feel like an old high on you know take you don't see how much what\nI Would say I'm not an empire I'm more like an anthropologist because I I Want to be observing but not influencing as much as possible in front of the reason why we do video as well because I'm not in the room whenever I'm In the room there's an effect\nBut I get such a rich state of being in there and sometimes I Do that as well\nSo I just try to be applying the wall and try not to interfere as much as possible I'm\nWilling to try and take take this to putting that you go back the results of your experiment\nI don't want to interfere 'cause they can't ship me in the box factory line the role that we find out where the whole roles are [noise]\nAnd the creation of these rules is an international business world Donny I came on boats coated going on the late to legacy versions of pandemic [noise]\nRules are always tough because when you learn a game you want to get into the game right away you don't want a lot of rules but then you get stuck in the middle and you need something very precise so you're trying to write a book that's both\nCasual and breezy but oddly specific at the same time\nOne of the things that helps us as\nA game to translate into a lot of languages including German which is a very precise language so we will finish our rule book we'll send it off the translation and we will get dozens of questions from the German translator about where English has been incredibly sloppy or having to meanings\nIf we have time we always go back to the English world and rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\nLanguages from other countries so turned back in the whole game design\nYeah in their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be globally all affected in some way I mean you're like in Germany can't put a tank on the cover of a game\nIf not if it might be illegal but it certainly heavily frowned upon and put that on a cover you just won't do it in Germany so it it'd be a thing of the culture you have to think of a language you have to think of how people played\nSuddenly got kind of postal Germans to take away the combat games and things like that did not feed into the creation of cooperative games by that [noise]\nIt fit into what were called German games the nineties and then Europe games which was the interesting thing because of the post war fatigue and cultural sort of a version to direct conflict\nThey added designed games where you really didn't take anything from anyone else's you sort of passively aggressively got in a place where they wanted to be so if there's one space and we can only get you can have your person there I can and I get there first I technically haven't taken anything from you know I just prevented you from getting something\nIs is both the same in very different but it led to a whole other way of thinking about board games like what if we were all just racing to do better\nAnd it's just been the blossoming of game design over the past Twenty years just from the host more aversion to direct conflict\nThere ah probably around five hundred games develop her general Tony telling games about everything you could imagine titles about ... you know ... creations of supernatural steam\nTo the ... trade current that speaking to him about his Korea\nI found out that the work that he said it's still having a ... an influence on the way that we live now\nWhen I moved out to Silicon Valley in Nineteen Ninety seven I got a job at a cleric corporation is part of apple exciting sexy job as they happen to live in the west and and make my way out to California\nI think they're all four months before I got laid off and really got it got a sense of what it's all really lifestyle as it and I don't know much security yeah exactly there's a lot of turnover but you just kinda got adept at at\nSwitching jobs and maintain a big network of people and it was really exciting\nAnd the right in saying that you were working on what we call the personalization of the way\nWhen I was working we're starting to do what was not working so saps or just kind of coming out of the team that was working on Yahoo and it was the lead interaction designer working a lot of their social I guess what now you'd call social networking applications [noise] say something that now it was really defining tech coach ... kind of stuff\nYeah I mean back when I was working on that that people didn't want to put their photo op on line because I thought that was being too public a set that we take for granted now [noise] ah what was really on the edge when I was working on it and we're just\nBeginning to understand what they like to make an update that you share with people and now you know you couldn't see students various you know everywhere but it back in the time we were just kind of learning with us interaction patterns we're helping to document though it's been ... across the opposite\nSides of the defining stokes the coach now isn't it yeah I mean it's like it's got to figure out to sea and everywhere I mean people are checking I found hundreds of times a\nDay which really struck me the the two days is that you know work in an old ... failed he's kind of on plugged from something that society is awash with now social media because about face to face contact\nYeah it's one thing I really liked about tabletop gaming and it's very different from a electronic and making that you are you're playing with people across the table here making eye contact it's like this medium protecting across your dining room table it gives people an excuse to to be with each other and that that's one thing I really love\nFor the importance of that time away from screens big games like yours allow [noise]\nBut I think that devices that really isolating you know you're not on your I patterned on

last summer when in the middle\nOf protest and protests when I was in college I was going really well they just finished up the pro game gone through all the rules they won the prologue to bring into
