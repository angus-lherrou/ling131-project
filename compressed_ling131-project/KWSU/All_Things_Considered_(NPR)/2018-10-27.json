century three point seven percent that's a huge turn around here in Michigan the right was close to a Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago\nSqueezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof there was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down and two thousand ten it's odd\nStanding here see motion all you know\nI'm sure it is it's crazy what does the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nA sick I get sick sick man just the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here and there was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work during the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a dark and scary\nAnd you know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody like losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect the larger patterns in the U. S. workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout [noise]\nNow at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the southern beautiful here too yeah very elevated he writes a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry and the days are over them good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nI'm not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people and all these great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and then we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck workplace policies at eighty again today Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes\nEverything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays\nWishing to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy as auto industry jobs went away the health care field\nGroup and was there any part of the thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYeah very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant closed mhm did the thing about marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\nYeah\nI Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent he used to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore\nI felt like I had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independents again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think

after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Peyton she's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton and started working as a cleaner on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen you have that job for about three years\nIt

with us from Texas Thanks John\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U.S economy continues to grow at a strong pay thanks to healthy spending by consumers and the government the Commerce Department said today that the growth rate three point five percent string quarter but NPR's Jim Zarroli reports they were assigned to potential trouble including weak business spending\nAs he often does President Trump painted to those numbers that's historic and unprecedented\nThey just announced an estimate of three point five and these are numbers that we're not even thought about\nIn fact the growth rate was only a bit better than most economists expected and it was a drop from the four point two percent growth rate in the second quarter still the numbers were impressed\nSo many people are in the job market\nLots of people are working in drawing paychecks even if those paychecks aren't growing as fast as my life that's going to fuel economic growth and in

to more investment spending by companies Gregory ... is chief us economist at Oxford economics\nWhen you take a look outside of the consumer rail you're starting to see some headwinds of caring for the U.S economy in particular when it comes to business activity\nThose headwinds include a Federal Reserve that has steadily raising interest rates\nHigher rates tend to dampen spending by people in businesses over time and there are already signs of weakness in the housing in car markets\nJacko also site say gradual slowing and the global economy in Europe and Asia meanwhile the stimulus from the tax cuts should begin to wane by next year ... says that should bring the growth rate under three percent next year\nWe should expect to see so much slower momentum but overall the economy is
