became clear protestors warm couch [laughter]\nWhat a lasting impact of this on the court on the national mood on the mid term election to talk about all of that we've got congressional reporter Kelsey Snell White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe and political reporter Tim Mak everybody hey there right\nSo it's pretty clear by the limits of margins Brett Kavanaugh is headed to the Supreme Court Kelsey walk us through when that became crystal clear on friday\nBecame crystal clear within a matter of minutes when Susan Collins the Republican senator from Maine\nIn Canada and then just a few minutes later Joe mansion the Democrat from West Virginia announced that he would also be supporting cap it on and that brought us to very clearly locked in yes ...\nAnd we're going to circle back to ... in a moment buck fifty one forty nine is how that key cloture vote had played out earlier friday or at the time we thought there was still a chance that people could change their mind but but ... was that really ugly or moment where it was like okay this looks like it's probably going to happen\nIt did look that way there was a few moments where we were chasing around senators or Tim and I were standing in different hallways different parts of the capital trying to find people like Senator Jeff Flake a Republican of Arizona and cones and we mentioned the mansion\nTo see if they were going to stick with their votes um flake with a little bit cryptic we didn't really know what was going to happen and then ... went and had lunch\nWith Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and he came out saying that he felt pretty good about things and from there it seems like we're heading in that direction where the fifty one vote for going to quickly come into place\nTim friday was a really tense day on Capitol Hill it's been a really tense a week on Capitol Hill scenes Jeff Flake negotiated this the way this one we\nThe way in which the FBI would we open investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's background there's been a lot of questions about\nWho could eventually get to yes on ... and I we we found the answer on friday but the fact is that there's been a lot of uncertainty and a lot of demonstrations here on Capitol Hill and a lot of lobbying on both sides with this issue\nTaking a step back president from now must put to pick up the Supreme Court and has replaced the swing vote with a reliable conservative\nAnd this is a big deal for President Trump he often says people tell him the Supreme Court in one of the most important things ah that a president can do and and so he has been able to deliver a too conservative a strong conservative\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nInto the race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson the singing and Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats telling me you know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this guy is running a masterful\nCampaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman carrying gas wise I actually had met her before during the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump She told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of had had this a little bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at any rate cuts in the beginning and his government for the election\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that she had heard she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's had to change in major part she says because she's Puerto Rican\nShow me he's working from ... to his show me what he'd do\nAn awesome it can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote is in Florida\nYet still you know activists will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now\nAnd the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and to some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within this community have said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this community power within the electorate\nYou know when you talk about the Puerto Rican community rich got\nYou know she broke very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times\nSo this is a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week ... you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate I should point out was being hosted by the local Telemundo station he was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there there were a couple of major issues that came up\nHealth care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country Bill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically and the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians\nThe other issue that came up a lot was immigration and Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott as being his hard line on immigration\nYou know on the other side Rick Scott is saying that the bill nothing really just wants to have open borders ... one\nOf the big themes of of race of the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trend for some more voters throughout the country that's really the case here in Florida as well because this was not the only statewide race and and we've seen that but other races are having an impact\nThe Senate race absolutely in fact I had one Republican operative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls\nOr his lead in the last four polls for example very very narrowly and within the margin of error but that's a shift the reason for that they said it'd be energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum he said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy\nAnd since it's Florida I think we can be pretty confident that are probably stay an arrow race between now and election day this is one of the most fifty fifty a fifty fifty states across the country or a Dominican mountain are Oh thanks so much You're welcome an alcoholic thank you thank you this is the politics you from NPR we'll be right back\nIn the pollution and lose ... valley it'll be too late for the

just\nHere with a special broadcast through the mid term elections and so far this year\nAnd our confirmation fight a lot of Republicans and suddenly talking about a backlash to all of them the blood\nDrenched jihad against this innocent man there's good and decent man\nWe're finding now that the the the viewer a white male it's okay to be against white guys out your\nDoor that's all I didn't get paid for them in Britain this ball show male voters are suddenly\nEnergized 'cause I think it could easily as well turn out to me the era of the man who feel like targeted on their back all the time and it's not fair\nAnd it may have a lot to do with calls from President Trump saying the real victim of the me too movement is innocent men\nA person was never meant [noise] said that I just things that were horrible and they're firing me from my job I don't know what to do mom what do I do what do I do mom\nIs the backlash real and what does it mean for the four hundred and thirty five house seats and thirty five Senate seats up for grabs in the next few weeks\nWe've got White House correspondent Tamara Keith political correspondent Asma Khalid\nAnd political editor Domenico Montanaro here to sort this all out hey everybody\nHey hey there I was going to diminish ... we saw a shift in all of this over the last few weeks especially when it came to how President Trump talked about this you saw President Trump act very timid lead toward Christine Blasey Ford in part because the White House wasn't sure how this was going to play politically\nCertainly she was a very credible which says well\nGuess what that changed in fact our NPR NewsHour Marist Poll that came out this week found a twelve point uptick enthusiasm among Republicans those Republicans who are saying that the that this election it was very important when we pulled them back in July it was sixty eight percent now that eighty percent and it's largely driven by Republican men\nYeah what stood out to me in in that poll was in what's called the generic ballot so who are you more what party are you more likely to vote for in the mid term\nYeah there was a six point jump among men\nNow they were more likely to vote for Republican than for a Democrat just in the past week yes that is it just in the past week and that is absolutely has everything to do with the cabinet hearings yeah there's a certain amount of backlash that has taken place you know they're\nSo much focus so much of our focus and everyone's focus following the hearing was on how women reacted um especially women on the left and there were women coming forward telling their stories that were women volunteering for campaigns and they there was a big surge in campaign donations\nBut there was something else happening two men were\nYou just did a story on this this isn't a new thing from President Trump\nNo not only is it not a new thing for President Trump it's not a new thing in American culture and politics so President Trump really ran on some of this grievance and and some of that\nFear among people are particularly among white Republican men\nThat the culture has shifted beneath them that you know that they're being left behind that they're being left behind so President Trump and his campaign talked about the forgotten man he talked a lot about political correctness run amok and I was talking to Frank Luntz who's a Republican pollster\nUm and he was saying that President Trump tapped into something that had been bubbling up\nAlong with the societal changes that have been going on for more than a generation\nIs being used by some to try to energize the white conservative male to say hey look now you're the victim you're the one who's been punished\nSo let's start with this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done that's right the Congress passed an\nAuthorization bill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve it's got a lot of money in it to run that agency and all the functions but we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complaints for example cramped seats the width of the seats and the leg room\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum average is giving a bigger seats in Congress has not yet giving you a bigger seat neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nTo do that also uh to ban cell phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and ditto for each cigarette you might not have thought they were allowed but they hadn't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAll right and another big thing that happened this week one one of the topics that have just dominated the Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic and how to deal with it that that got done to this week\nPerhaps the main thrust of the bill Scott has a renewed effort to stop the shipping of synthetic opioids things like fencing or are there were twenty thousand deaths from a fencing oh I'm related overdoses\nI just a couple of years ago and to prevent the introduction of fat and I would really big big big difference so the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority\nThey're also going to lengthen the support period for Medicaid patients eligibility for treatment\nAnd broaden eligibility for all substance abuse\nFor those treatment programs\nAnd also there's going to be more money and more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller okay\nShifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wants to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married that's right\nHave to be legally married to qualify for that second base it that's a ...\nLegal in less than ten percent of the countries that send a bath citizen diplomats to the United nations\nSo those people the people who work for the United nations are going to account for roughly half a couple of the state department estimates will be affected\nSo the state department says this is about treating everybody the same if you're a heterosexual couple right now you can't get a visa for the second person without being married so this is intended to level the playing field of course the differences\nYou can get a heterosexual marriage and just about any country in the world but in fewer than ten percent of the United nations countries is that possible so is there a plan\nFor for people who live in a country with that same sex marriage or can you just not bring your partner they're going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going to be felt\nAround That's NPR's Ron Elving catching us up on some of the news we miss this week as he does every single week here on the politics shell from NPR Nike Ron thank you so [noise]\n\nAnd as I said this is the politics you from NPR we're going to take a quick

elections and every week\nWe dig deep into an issue that galvanizing voter babies out of their mother literally ripped out of their mothers are\nImmigration they're bringing drugs [noise]\nThey're bringing crime there rape\nIs President Trump launched his campaign with a controversial hard line stance on immigration and voters latched on to\nRemember that speech and I was badly criticized oh what's so terrible when he turned out I was a hundred percent right that's why I got elected\n[noise]\nCarry that immigration talk into his\nPresidency and turned it into policy President Trump moments ago signed an executive order this will affect the separation of parents from their children at the major backlash tonight against President Trump's travel ban the president's message just fear got Republicans out to vote but it's his policies as president that may turn Democrats out\nBeating heart of this election is border security we have to have\nTo dig into all of this my co host off Mulholland sat down with NPR's John Burnett and Mara Liasson John covers immigration is based in Texas ... one of our national political correspondent\nHello to you both either high [noise]\nPresident Trump began his administration with you know what somebody described it pretty mean spirited policy of the travel ban it was one of the first things he did in office\nAnd even more recently the summer there with his and he should have a family separation this was a huge low point for the Trump Administration in part because they had to roll back a policy that they said was not a policy and many people were incredibly upset even people within his own party he\nWas a summary of where the policy itself stands at this point\nThere's still several hundred kids that are in us custody and new shelters around the country and health and Human Services which is responsible for ... for finding a foster homes for them and sponsors has said it's taking us all\nUm the family member who wants to take the child back but I use a larger question is did this achieve its\nGoals the goal was to act as a deterrent I'm really to shock potential immigrants into not coming to the U.S and I had an interview with the chief of staff John Kelly a last may and he said that explicitly to me\nA big name of the game is deterrence if if their family separation stands as a pretty tough or it could be a tough deterrent a would be a tough deterrent\nUm a a much faster turnaround on asylum even though people say that's cruel and heartless to take a mother away from her children yeah I think you're cruel and heartless I wouldn't put it quite that way the children will be taken care of\nAnd so obviously the numbers that are referred to earlier about the jump in the family unit and unaccompanied kids crossing the border over the summer uh shows that it didn't have a deterrent effect\nHeal my sense of how this me at all affect the mid term you know the makeup of Congress to this issue again it's one that I Would argue and an out talking to voters and somewhat again faded from the conscious\nIf the debate is about border security Republicans win in other words if you're talking about abolishing ice which sounds like dismantling our border security system than Republicans when if you're focusing on separating kids from their parents Democrats win\nBut family separation is over now added over now right and so the of the president's ongoing executive order 'em and so I hear it down in Texas all the way from the attorney general's race to congressional races to the the big Senate race um they use family separation as shorthand\nFor you know look at the atrocities committed by this administration I just don't know how much traction they're getting with that um but it's a it's been wide circulation\nBut these things are like like different ingredients in a big ... do I mean they all add up to a feeling that among Democrats and many independents that the Trump Administration has somehow abandoned\nBasic American principles and um you know I think that as a specific issue driving voters in the midterms no it's not that but it definitely went into the soup and helped Democrats make this argument that Donald Trump and the Republicans are way out of the mainstream and need a check and balance", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year":
