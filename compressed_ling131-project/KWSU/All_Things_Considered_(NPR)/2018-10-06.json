NPR News this is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly and judge Brett Kavanaugh is now one step away from my feet on the Supreme Court looks like he has the votes he needs to be confirmed in a final vote tomorrow this\nAfternoon the last undecided Republican Susan Collins of Maine delivered a lengthy floor speech\nShe talked about Kavanaugh's qualifications for the

how this confirmation\nYou want to go to the fifty on people who voted yes before our very likely now to vote yes tomorrow when the final confirmation vote comes up\nNow that's not to say that some crazy thing couldn't happen between now and not enough and we have to keep those catty outgoing but this means that the support that that we saw earlier today it seems to stand and it means that vice president Mike Pence did not appear to be needed to break any ties writes\nA robot he might have had to point how to how to not checking out quite this way today okay senator Collins she laid out our position and a link for speeches or he just said a didn't appear to have been undecided anytime that recently I'm and she was from start to finish it was pretty clear how she was wanting to vote\nYet she basically use her speech as a kind of closing argument it was as much of that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else\nUm she basically was saying that he is not the extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is and she walks through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed and that she did that for more than forty minutes\nAnd she made it pretty tough case there she said that she didn't like that this had become what she called gutter level political campaign instead of a solemn confirmation process\nEarlier today she had lunch with I'm Senator Mitch McConnell and I was in the room there well she was making that speech and he sat in just a few seats away from her and turned his seat so he could walk her well she spoke and it was it was a it was ... it was clear that he was prepared and ready and kind of knew what was coming to me a little bit more about how she said she wrestled with the allegations of sexual assault\nYeah she said that she believes that something may have happened to forward and I'm Christine Blasey Ford the woman who originally accused Kevin ... of sexual assault\nBut she says she doesn't think that the process that they went through and going through his record on earth any evidence that it was Kavanaugh who did it\nAnd she's sticking to her belief in the presumption of innocence and she spoke about

Shapiro in Chicago today a stunning verdict for the police officer who shot and killed a black teenager\nJason Van Dyke was found guilty of second degree murder ... the clown McDonald sixteen times it was caught on camera and sparked an uproar in Chicago it also trigger the Justice Department to conduct an investigation and the police department finding out\nHi Shannon hello this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction\nWell acted this I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for first degree murder charge they're satisfied with a second degree murder charge this is something we haven't seen happen in Chicago for decades so I think for those activists it's feeling like a moment of celebration\nWe've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concerned for what it will mean for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during the trial what did you say\nWell he described require McDonald as somebody to be a feta he described his face as a frightening describes his eyes as blank\nUm he said that the that that was ... raised and life up to his shoulder um which is not something you can shape looking at the dashcam video of this incident so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of events didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community\nWell I think that's hard to say because I think that the tension here had been more about more than just look on McDonald's you'll have to remember that in addition to this trial there is another trial related to the shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of aquatic Donald\nA preventive at night and their reports and\nI think that there's this feeling that the shooting was a\nA problem that the community feels but also vast feeling that officers covered it up so I think we'd be watching closely what happens in that trial in how the sea reacts to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is a rare exception what do you think made a different\nWell I think the number of shot six ... made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers on that night who encountered the chronic Donald and chose not to shoot I think that that was important to a lot of folks at that noticed\nThe w._b. easy reporter Shannon Heffernan reporting on the trial and conviction of Chicago police officer Jason

studies or not he said she said the questions that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think sure\nWell we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him and his reputation as family that he would have acted like Enron Comic Con I'd had\nBy the way he acted like an atomic time I think the response what had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar\nAssociation of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers and said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople wing and then continuing to weigh in on both sides of it is absolutely right that let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no

about Donald Trump before he went on the ... ... you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut Tibet specific remarketing he went on to say that the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit ... do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics absolutely\nI I think there is no question that he found the\nBut when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there are some things they shouldn't have said what Thanksgiving should not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center a ... a for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that she was hot under the
