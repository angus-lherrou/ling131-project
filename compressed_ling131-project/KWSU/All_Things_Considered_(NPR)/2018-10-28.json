criticized President Trump have been criticized backed by the press broke it\nDown to reclaim bronco bombers watch that was not a lot of the way George Soros the legendary Maxine Waters [noise] we sort of most of the vice found\nIn a mailbox public officials including former president for rock Obama and Clinton where a man has been taken into custody in the mail bombing case is just a few days ago the midterm seemed to focus on immigration and that caravan of immigrant making its way to the U.S Mexico border\nYou have some very big and before that was the contentious confirmation battle for justice Brett Kavanaugh but through all those twists and turns a lot of important factors have remained constant pi democratic enthusiasm to vote\nMobile approval rating for the president and a lot of political history indicating Democrats should be poised for big wins in how [noise]\nJust a week and a half to go before election day we're going to step back and take a closer look at the race for control of the house\nThat we have NPR's Dominican to narrow Tim Mak an Danielle Kurtzleben in the studio everybody hey\nSo let's start with the fact that historically and given some of the big picture trends Democrats really do have the wind at their backs let's walk through why exactly that it when presidents are in their first mid term\nThey lose a heck of a lot of seats on average it's just as a matter of and we've heard President Trump actually posit publicly why that is\nHow they get complacent [noise] not here right in\nAnd then they sort of a back off and the ... perhaps the content settled in and the people who are most motivated or the people who are most upset with the policies that the new president is putting in\nPlace fun fact on that so Gallup crunched the numbers a little bit earlier this year and they found that when the president's approval rating going into the midterms is below fifty percent and Trump's according to our latest poll is thirty nine percent\nThe president's party averages a loss of thirty seven seats in the house which by the way Democrats need fewer than that in order to take the house so when the president has approval of over fifty percent his party tends to lose only fourteen seat still alive but not nearly as huge\nOne Democrats have been incredibly enthusiastic all year ever since President Trump took office but in recent weeks we've seen Republican finally getting engaged getting enthusiastic as well\nYeah and as you get closer to the election that tends to happen and Republicans the advantage that they wind up having is is there a couple of advantages that Republicans have\nYou know these elections are mostly taking place on Republican turf in the house you know most of these places are at least Republican leaning because Republicans have\nRun up the score when it comes to state legislative chambers and governors' seats which are the ones that control redistricting so a lot of they won so many their control correct\nSo the interesting point here is that so much of that redistricting was only possible because so many state legislatures went to Republican majorities greater Republican majorities because of the Republican wave in Obama's first term in twenty ten right and\nThe other advantage is that Republicans tend to have is the the demographic makeup of turnout is usually older whiter voters more likely to the polls and they make up a larger share of the Republican Party then for Democrats\nThan you know the other thing that Republicans should have working in their favor but if you've looked at the polling so far it hasn't really materialized as the fact that by most metrics the economy is doing really well right now\nYeah so I mean what we can say about that is that it's not going to hurt Republicans as here they're in power and the economy is doing well that's that's great for them but when you look at how the economy interacts with midterms\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular\nRace has been an issue in this race or maybe not totally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently\nThat looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning 'em to Georgia flag back in the nineties at the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgian including the governor of Georgia for deeply disturbed by the racial ... that was embedded in the state flag without Confederate symbol\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate assembled to be removed as well\nThis is one of the top tier national races this year a lot of people paying attention to it a lot of a likely demo\nThis governor's race that's getting so much attention given all the other races going on all across the country\nWell you know Georgia is one of those states that has been traditionally Republican but there have been fine that it could be moving away from that certainly the demographics suggest that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this race since the beginning less than two weeks left what are you thinking about are looking for the final days of this race my big\nQuestion right now is how well you'd Abrams reaching and communicating to voters who may not be as engaged and don't usually vote in these midterm elections Abrams has gotten a lot of attention in the national media\nThe fact that she would be the first African American female governor is a big deal\nBut campaigns done a really good job of labeling her in a simple way but she's just too extreme for George ...\nSafety even it could be spending rating liberal streaming campaign\nIt's clear and concise people can understand what he's getting at their Abrams I'm not sure has done the same with Ken and so my big question is you know Abrams talks a lot about her policy proposal she's very smart\nBut how well did that reach people in Georgia and maybe even more rural parts of the state that don't have access to as much education or resources are they going to be motivated in the same way that maybe they were for President Obama back in two thousand eight\nAnd people compare this election to like the Obama wave that I'd Abrams needs to inspire voters and the same way that Obama did in two thousand eight Obama did not win Georgia in two thousand it he lost by about two hundred thousand votes so that's a huge hill that Abrams has to climate she's going to\nWin this race and we will have answers to all those questions in less than two weeks That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro as well as Johnny Kauffman of W.

you through everything you need to know what the elections disclose people are focusing on the polls to try to get a sense\nOf what might happen on election day just about a week from ... showing dealing with one point lead well within the margin of error real player politics however\nHas it at a dead heat and the president's poll numbers are going out running neck and that is this the rape to watch on election night the new NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll confirms enthusiasm is high for both Republicans and Democrats and he worked for already confirmed that\nThis election it's all about president Donald Trump\nAs you know I like to look at it falls only one where when I Do like a month or\nSo to me now to talk through this with NPR's Dominican mountain arrow and Daniel Kirk late but hey there hey All right so about a month ago we had to pull out and it got a lot of national attention because it showed a lot of good news for Republicans ... this time around looks like Democrats\nAre going to be happier people reading it well it looks like essentially that the Kevin a confirmation fight and all that it did to fire up Republicans as kind of faith\nAnd quite a bit when you look at the landscape for the house races for example the vast majority of those races are being run in places that Republicans hold these and that has not changed\nLet's get to the pool and the numbers are Dominican what are the biggest takeaways for you looking at this point\nThe big thing is that President Trump is seen as the biggest factor in A People's vote and really the numbers are kind of remarkable even when you put them in historical context two thirds of people say that Trump is either a major or minor factor in deciding their vote in less than two weeks on November ...\nCompare that to twenty fourteen when Republicans took back then it\nJust forty seven percent of Americans said that Iraq Obama was a factor in their vote\nAs a twenty point jump that's a big deal and more people this time around say that they are motivated to go vote for a Democrat because of their impressions of President Trump than in twenty four teen when people said that their impressions of President Obama made them want to go vote for a Republican\nSo I mean President Trump is campaigning saying of voters if I'm On the ballot you know this was about and may get trying to get his supporters to the polls but this result shows that this is a negative\nIt depends on who you're talking to you though right I mean people in either party Democrats and Republicans once again already in their corner Trump may be affecting their vote off and he is\nAnd you know for Democrats makes them less likely to vote for Republican more likely to vote for a Democrat for Republicans vice versa interestingly in this poll the independence or where you see the interesting gender gaps on this for example\nWhen you ask independent voters how important is Trump to your vote you have fifty percent of independent women saying he is very important compared to twenty eight percent of independent men that's a bigger divide then you see among Republicans or Democrats likewise\nWhen they say okay so how's Trump going to affect your vote fifty percent of independent women say more likely to make the vote for a Democrat thirty three percent of independent men say that\nSo when we talk about gender divide and this is important this year\nYes women are a driving factor we do have the potential this year across the board for there to be a bigger gender gap in this year's midterm are as big of a gender gap as we've seen in a very long time but that said it's not just about gender it's also about party democratic men and democratic women alike dislike Trump and are going to vote Democrats\nYeah I mean when Daniel talks about independence they really are an important factor here and that's because President Trump has really done very little to reach beyond the base with a lot of what he's talked\nIndependent young voters Latino you know they don't turn out to vote as much in mid term year so you know if the goal is to drive up the base and this was going to be a base election which is the gamble than they need to fire up the Republican base with a lot of these cultural issues\nAs we raise the Democratic party is openly encourage caravan\nAfter caravan of illegal aliens to violate laws and break is\nI have a quick question though I mean when you say this is a base election I mean compared to presidential elections mid term elections are always kind of the reactions right I mean is this year that much difference\nSo the thing is with that is really fascinating I think raises a lot of alarm bells for Republicans\nIs that yeah usually these midterms are based elections but there are a lot of times this year that there's going to be record turnout or you know not only in me talking to Michael McDonald is a turnout expert at the University of Florida predict\nYou know a threshold for it turned out to be forty five to fifty percent which from mid term would be the highest and fifty years our posters that just looking at the interest level in our poll it could be the highest turn out in a century from a term\nThat's NPR's Ron Elving every week he catches us up on some of the stories that we might have missed thank you Ron thank you

health care for my first day I'm going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disasters Obamacare [noise]\nWith the Democrats ... Republicans found one of their best talking points they used it again and again\nWe're going to unify because we all every Republican ran on repealing\nAnd replacing it we're going to keep our promises that does seem within reach when Republicans gained control of the White House in addition to the house and Senate but\nThe Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nHas failed harsher tale of Obamacare failed by a single vote early today\nAfter seven years of promises to repeal and replace Obamacare it came down to just one vote the final vote forty nine to fifty one now it's Democrats who feel like health care is an advantage for them Democrats have talked about health care all election and the polls indicate that voters want to hear about it\nThat has Republicans on defense and we're going to talk about all of this with NPR's Scott Horsley Danielle Kurtzleben guys hey honey so let's take a few minutes here to talk about health care because all year we've been talking about how Democrats the healthcare\nAs their best issue with voters which is so striking because from twenty ten on after Obamacare passed Democrats were really on defence when it came to health care and they lost a lot of seats because of it so let's start with this how are people feeling about the state of health care right now\nI Would say concerned bare minimum but if you're a Democrat and you're much more worried I mean one thing we do know I can tell you from being on the trail and from polling data is that\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are worried about the health care system worried about access worried about costs but Democrats are much more worried and this is reflected in what voters telling you and it's reflected an ad Democrats have just been running more health care ads throughout the entire midterm cycle than Republicans have\nDetermined to fight for the health care not take it away\nThree hundred dollars in North Dakota and he has a preexisting condition that used to mean no health insurance now those red in touch with Morsi's offer to take away from people would bring\nTwo years on the Affordable CARE Act Republicans of course campaign saying they want it to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act they weren't able to do that thanks to John McCain's thumbs down in the Senate but the Trump Administration has been steadily wiggling away at the Affordable CARE Act to the last going on two years\nAnd it's worth pausing for a moment in walking through all the different ways the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have tried to undermine the Affordable CARE Act or have tried to replace the Affordable CARE Act because a lot of the ad come down to you voted to do this and Republicans are responding no I didn't so let's start with actions taken by the Trump Administration\nScott what are some of the biggest things that President Trump has done on his own to affect the Affordable CARE Act\nThey have offered up a variety of alternative insurance plans mostly sort of skimpy your plans that would be cheaper and might appeal to younger healthier people a book could also have the effect of raising prices for older sicker people\nThey have done away with some marketing budget to try to encourage enrollment in the Affordable care act's a health care marketplaces\nThey have ended subsidies for insurance companies which has had the effect of driving up premiums on the a C a marketplaces\nAnd then Congress as part of their tax overhaul did away with the tax penalty for people who don't have insurance so all this sort of been an attack on the AC a insurance marketplace\nWhich despite all that has proven to be pretty resilient a sign up so stay pretty level since before the Trump Administration came in\nAnd the most recent census data says we still have a about Ninety One percent of the American public covered by health insurance\nDanielle of course most of twenty Seventeen was focused on Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare they ultimately failed but what should we know about what was in those bills how the house bill that passed and how the Senate bailed it didn't pass because of John McCain would have changed Obamacare\nOne of the biggest things that's most failing in this election cycle is what that there was always builds would have done to pre existing conditions this is what Democrats are attacking Republicans on and so many of these ads saying that\nRepresentative cell in hell voted for the Obamacare repeal and replace failed that they'll what has done away with the protections for pre existing conditions and Scott Republicans running for reelection are defending\nFrom these attacks in an interesting way basically saying how dare you insinuate I don't care about\nIt's really the mirror image of what we've seen in the past few election cycles when Republicans were on the attack going after the Affordable CARE Act the promising to repeal Obamacare and Democrats were largely staying quiet they knew that says Ford will correct wasn't terribly popular at that point\nNow we have voters saying well they might not love Obamacare writ large they do like various provisions of it and you've got Democrats running about half their ads defending those provisions including the GOP on the defensive\nWhen you look at television ads when you compare pro Democrat to pro Republican that were put out this year I'm a democratic ad yes like Scott said more than half of them have been about health care this is according to the Wesleyan Media project which tracks the things\nHere is how in building Democrats feel this year that's compared to from twenty ten twenty twelve twenty fourteen twenty sixteen in those years roughly seven to ten percent of democratic ads are about healthcare Democrats did not want to touch healthcare during that time now this year they are all about it\nAnd it's the same time we have a group of Republican attorneys general who have gone to court in Texas to try to strike down the Affordable CARE Act two of those state attorneys general happened to be running for Senate one in Missouri and one in West Virginia\nJosh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri has been running ads saying\nOh I definitely would protect people with preexisting medical conditions even though he's gone to court to unwind exactly that protection in the Affordable CARE Act\nEarlier this year we learned our oldest has a rare chronic disease preexisting conditions we know what that's like I'm just calling I support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre existing conditions\nWell that is a statement that you could argue is very much at odds with the lawsuit that he is a part to unwind the Affordable CARE Act\nIf you're just joining us You're listening to the politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow here in the studio with NPR's Scott Horsley and Danielle Kurtzleben talking about health care so what is at the basis of all of this a focus on health care I mean do people care more about healthcare now than they did two years ago or four years ago\nOne is that Obamacare is somewhat more popular now than it was back during a lot of the Obama administration and if you look at polling data from say twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen Obamacare was generally seen net unfavorably more people seeing it on paper bleeding favorably\nThat slipped right around the time that Donald Trump took office", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Pullman", "day": "28"}
