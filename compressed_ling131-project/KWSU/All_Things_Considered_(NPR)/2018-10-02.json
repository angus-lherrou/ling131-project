up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons tax up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually kind of a month after the election\nThe Trump people staying in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he he comes for an hour listens politely and leave\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside of the department\nBut they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that hey ... from their especially didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency was supposed to be doing\n[noise] I mean let's take an example uh inside the department of commerce there's the national weather service\nThe national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose campaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it\nOr is it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person has an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investments in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits fracking whether\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term cost of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme in his administration and the way it's running the government\nThat it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think the deal they do with their conscious is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term [noise]\nAre these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\n[noise] you know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit a so and those are people who made a career out of those are people who really know really know the jobs and the importance of the jobs\nAnd on top of that Trump still hasn't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government so there's been a grain of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer I harder every day\nYou ended his book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named miss Finley\nAnd she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that now [noise]\nFirst let's explain why miss family wanted airborne going\nHer husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined this ... active destruction would come and kind of ease or paying she wouldn't have to stare at the barn any longer and which he doesn't imagine is that with the same tornado that's going to come take her barn is going to destroy your house and she didn't want that and I thought it was\nImagination works ... imagines the destruction it wants and imagines the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government it doesn't imagine all the collateral damage he doesn't imagine the damage it will actually do\nAnd I think this failure of the imagination is somewhere near the center of what we're going through right now [noise]\nMichael Lewis his new book is the fifth risk thanks for joining us today\nTomorrow on MORNING edition California Governor Jerry Brown\nI top neutrality regulations into law on the train station has filed a lot of California's new law clash with federal holiday tomorrow here from the professor who came up with the term net neutrality you can ask your smart speaker to play NPR on your local station tiny [noise]\nIn the northwest public broadcasting it's six twenty nine [noise]\n\nStill to come on the program coming up next to this on your NPR News station to market place it on your NPR in classical music stations all things considered we'll continue the FBI\nHas just finished his as just days to finish its new investigation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh [noise] to do it\nQuickly you can do a polygraph of all three people involved in the alleged sexual assault you could polygraph all three of them\nMore on what else to bureau might do given the short timeframe that's at six thirty five [noise] the programs you enjoy a northwest public broadcasting I made possible with\nFinancial support from blisters like you and for Blue Cross of Idaho has not for profit insurer Blue Cross of Idaho negotiates with providers to create a variety of health insurance coverage in care options for its policyholders details at B.

ever heard such a part in language like that during a confirmation hearing\nNo I haven't and not even during the confirmation of Clarence Thomas ... nothing like that\nTo let the Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court do you think that he can be seen as an impartial arbiters in cases with political undertone\nIt depends upon who's doing the fear I think the losers will not see his decision as impartial he is now branded as favoring the right over left so in political cases so left will expect to lose and do attribute that laws\nNot to a disinterested treatment with a lower but to a political agenda\nI mean there's this ideal that a lot of people have about the Supreme Court that the justices that this court is above politics or should be above politics but let me ask you how far removed in that ideal from reality [noise]\nVery far removed first of all their justice has been appointed by president of a particular party who\nIf he's doing his homework will be sure to a point to justice who will likely you agree with the political position of that party so while we have decisions that use the language of a law\nWe know that the court's decisions the justices

friendship\nHe also did mention the other parts of it that the partying\nAnd yes people might have had too many beers on occasion and people generally in high school I think all of us are probably done things we look back on and high school and we're glad her cringe a bit but I that's not what we're talking about\nYou can come away from most of that interview thinking\nHere's someone who was really studious and didn't really have time for that much partying um but he was asked in the interview by Martha ... whether he ever drank so much that he couldn't remember the night before no ah that never happened never says anyone I don't remember anything about last night now\nSo that's the description who gave Fox News several days later he spoke to the Senate Judiciary committee under oath and here's what he said in his opening statement\nI drank beer with my friends almost everyone did sometimes I have too many beers sometimes others did I liked fear I still like beer but I did not drink beer to the point of watching out and I never sexually assaulted anyone\nAnd that set the stage for many hours of conversation between cabin on senators about beer\nYes there were probably two dozen references to beer during the hearing and senators asked about it on a number of occasions including as Senator Sheldon Whitehouse who in the Democrat and asked cabinet about your book in

gun is assembled and he takes off the blindfold and he says I'd like to see some of the foreign do this and and the ads on national attention he later had a best selling book about lessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic presidential candidate in twenty twenty so really\nSeemed like a rising politician the Democratic party and his\nDecision today to part of the race came as a surprise and I came with a very honest and emotional letter message or tell us about it\nRight it was just hours ago candor posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem\nUh that he'd been ... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and you've been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago\nUm he said that when he should have been celebrating for example or having a raised a record amount of funds in his mayoral campaign he was actually in a in crisis and he was on the veterans crisis line the Vietnam veterans crisis line in tears saying that yes he had\nBeen having suicidal thoughts\nUm so he decided that he should take a step back from the campaign and

that Amazon is one of NPR sponsors I reached clerk at that California warehouse\nWhere we are now but now in dollar minimum they before any other\nThe Fifteen dollar minimum kicked in on November first for all Amazon workers in the U.S fulltime part time time and seasonal Amazon says that's about three hundred and fifty thousand employees total I ask Clark how much a warehouse temp job might pay at Amazon now\nAre lower in a facility was under eleven dollars and it ranges over Fifteen dollars\nThis already far above the federal minimum wage of seven dollars and twenty five cents but still Amazon's bay has been facing a lot of criticism as a company ballooned into a global giant with half a million employees many of whom are drivers and warehouse workers\nAmazon is the second most valuable American Company it's run by the wealthiest man in the world CEO Jeff Fager [noise]\n\nTwo weeks ago a group demonstrated outside of the speech and Washington protesting the wide gap between bases his wealth and the wages for his lowest paid employees\nInside bay those spoke to several hundred Washington Power brokers and he was asked about the growing intention that Amazon was getting from critics who think it's become too big and too powerful ... said scrutiny like that is good for society\nAll big institutions of any kind are going to be and should be examined scrutinized inspected\nIn his statement about this\nHigh profile ones has been Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\nOr have to give credit where credit's as soon as a matter of what I did the right thing\nSanders has long been campaigning for better conditions and pay for minimum wage workers including at retail and fast food restaurant he has introduced a bill called the ... act which stands for stop that employers by zeroing out subsidies\nThe bill would tax large corporations whose workers rely on federal benefits like food stamps\nAnd our hope and believe that I'm a constitution today will cause other companies like Wal Mart a fast food industry to start reading their wages as well so so good there for American workers\nAmazon is not the first big retailer to make a public show of raising the minimum wage target plans to get to Fifteen dollars an hour by twenty twenty Costco had fourteen dollars this summer but Amazon is now the country's second largest private employer\nI thought it was great news I don't see how could be other than good news\nIt offers an economist at MIT and he said there are several ways to view Amazon skeptically won the unemployment rate is low and there is high demand for workers\nOne interpretation is look it was going to have to raise wages anyway Italy marketers tightening uh so it just you know decided to get some good publicity out of that\nAutor says no matter the reason it's important to remember that raises are good for the workers who get them their local economies lower wage workers out of that they do tend to spend extra earnings\nAnd there's another kind of surprising way that Amazon made weights day it's saying that it will lobby Congress for an increase in the federal minimum wage\nHowever Amazon Dave Clark told me the company does not plan to push for a federal minimum all the way up to Fifteen dollars\nWe think is the right numbers Rockville even to the person but\nSenator Sanders said he hopes the ... stamp of approval convinces

memory and he routinely your insights on himself and asked the guards to take him to the toilet\nThe problem in this case Stephen ... is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him the eighth amendment he said it's not like the constitutions other amendment it's a mirror of our norms and our values\nAnd what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders them so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable\nThat executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual
