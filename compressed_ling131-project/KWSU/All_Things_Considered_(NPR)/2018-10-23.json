from our planet money podcast\nAge Nineteen Ninety two in Virginia the pop was twenty seven million dollars big for the time\nAnd when winter comes forward it seems like something is unusual that someone managed to buy every single combination of tickets to guarantee a win and this totally perplexed as the people who run the lottery system like Ken source and visit him on TV shortly after\nThe very idea of spending over seven million dollars to buy all the shares a lottery just seems preposterous\nThe man behind the plan was defined Mondale I tracked him down a couple of years ago the last time there was a big lottery jackpot [noise]\nHe was living on an island in the south Pacific ... hello hello Hi this is defined Mondo yeah\nHe says that Virginia thing it took decades to get to that level the story starts in Romania in the late Nineteen fifties stuff on Monday has a young family and he wants to get out of the country\nI mean you know I live in a\nFactory I'm sixty ... which was the good of shoes\nDecides the lottery is his way out he's a pretty natural math whiz so he goes to the library\nLots of tickets in certain combination he can guarantee himself at least a second prize so we pools his money with three friends and he buys the tickets\nWe want Seventy two thousand seven hundred and they could easily which was about eight years of Charlotte\nRight big score that was on your first try yeah he takes the money and he leaves Romania for Australia he finds more investors he raises more money enough to buy all the combinations of numbers for the bigger Australian lottery and he turns lottery winning into a business for a while\nYou know I Want drones\nEventually Australia passes a law to block them from buying up all the tickets so we set their sights on the big prizes in America\nHe decides Virginia is the place at the time there were seven point one million combinations of lottery tickets he waits until the jackpot is twenty five million or above to make sure that he's still turn a profit even if there's a split time the biggest problem with buying all the tickets though isn't money it's logistics\nFilling out millions of tickets each one different keeping track of where they are so you can find a winning tickets and then turning them all in so his secret was get the tickets ready ahead of time back then it was legal to print your own tickets already filled out so we set up printers going for over a month making the millions of tickets\nThen negotiated with stores across the state to let him turn in stacks of ten thousand tickets at a time and waited\nI knew that would lead one through five six second Brian I'm going to be to the ... and thousands minded writer\nHe says he couldn't do it again lotteries have now added extra numbers and

brings them to two thousand Eighteen\nStill looking back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life right you\nGet your heart broke in this case the daughters kind of torn out and there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that when seven games but it went back and forth changing lanes extra innings I've met with the scene in spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire\nTo get back and win the world series but really when you look at the field team is different because they wouldn't got many accountable I mean this could have been there all kinds of or eat or he's at shortstop they lost Corey secret during the season now they have a child and then really is there a case I Know it's not Clinton ...\nIts Walker bealer so adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honestly one of the best pitcher that we've seen in the national league they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what did they have going into this\nThey want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even though the daughters haven't won a World Series in Thirty years you know the red Sox have had that only Boston is that a lot of reason to celebrate between the patriots and the red Sox but this team is arguably one of the bat regular season

fact checkers busy\nWe're going to take a look now at some of the president's latest claims with NPR's Scott Horsley hey there Scott I already first let's talk about the caravan of Central American migrants the president has been talking a fair bit about that\nThey're making their way to Mexico and hopes of reaching the U.S border and now President Trump had suggested that they're not just a family's looking for a better life what is he saying instead\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan\nHe was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim but he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly you have people coming up\nAppropriate for our country and Tom not letting them in now it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is\nExtremely rare already out of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty four for ... from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with the caravan\nSay they have not seen any middle Easterners in that group\nAh there's no evidence than as Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any why is he talking about it\nThe illegal immigration and the threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first launched his White House campaign more than three years ago\nHe believes and there is some polling data to support this that illegal immigration is an important issue for Republicans he has been very clear on his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the home stretch of the midterm campaign\nThe\n\nCommon sense [noise]\nI just started on that list that tax cuts which I think a lot of mainstream Republicans thought would be the first thing that that tax cut they passed in twenty Seventeen but we hadn't been hearing too much about what's going on\nThe UP tax cut is not warn terribly well right now is pulling at about forty percent approval uh a lot of people maybe don't feel like they've seen a big jump in their own take home pay there's also been some renewed attention paid to the federal deficit which has ballooned as corporate tax revenue shrank\nThe president believes he has a fix for this though and it's another tax cut I Want to play a piece of tape from his rally in Houston last night or to you but I have to one you take this message with a big grain of salt\nWe're going to put in a ten percent tax cuts\nFor middle income families is going to be [noise]\nOr whatever you might think about the merits of another tax cut Congress certainly is not going to take any action on that next week they're not even session until after the election\nAnd what's more nobody outside the White House seems to know what the president is talking about the head of the house ways and Means Committee belatedly put out a statement this afternoon saying he's willing to work with the president over the coming weeks\nBut this appears to be a bit of political vapor aware that it's just time for the election and a tacit admission to the actual tax cut the

addresses has also gotten attention\nManner breads considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities she's the head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we say states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of ideas in order to be able to cast a ballot that will count\nWe're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue I've been reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting perch from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn the role in some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has and voted and two in three cycles or look we're not sure if this person still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\n[noise] um we want election and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nProcedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late\nUm critically we're also seeing that purging is happening in state that used to\nBe required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election process as we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increase in the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling this voter suppression um do
