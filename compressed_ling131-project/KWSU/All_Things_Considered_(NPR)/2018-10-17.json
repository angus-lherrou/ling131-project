candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nThis is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continued to apply right if you're not at the table you're on the menu and I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices aren't are not at the table um\nAnd and you know it's hard for me to separate being as you'd be the one and

you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae BP to people do think that shapes your experience\nThis is Gina I mean most certainly um I\nWonderful fellow than and turned on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I said don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come and so in the little time um but it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose an in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you ... and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan paved the way of says a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world look like Thirty years ago for someone that my agent uh\n[laughter] and I I mean it it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable\nBut as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and demeaned but when you consider where we were back then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term\nProcess the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beauty cue writes in some areas vice president Pence addressed the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center call that an anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first president to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans he's asked for our advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before\nAnd I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the algae community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again we're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. T. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so\nDance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community stepped up and wants to run for office kind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans women especially trans women of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that as they continue to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae beauty keep candidates as well Gina\nYeah I mean I can tell you uh do you won't believe it I Know that there are some folks in Washington and taxes that did not think a lesbian that could do how do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what a million disgust which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were when they do\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nSo one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I

when he went to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia he said explicitly we're not here to lecture we're not here to tell other people how to live what to do who'd be or how to worship\nAnd that statement sets aside decades' worth of bipartisan American commitment as well as the commitment of a range of western democracies to international human rights law\nBeyond Saudi Arabia do you see a link between

thing\nThere were lots of instances during the Obama\nAlso in Syria and it didn't do much to deter them so is it really possible to say that this is happening more because President Trump is an

dictators feel like they have a green light from the American president and that's pretty rare but the United states doesn't always criticized directly or one on one sometimes it works together with other western governments\nAnd they all do a day marched together or the issues simultaneous statements so that no one government gets the backlash all by itself\nAnd when the Trump Administration takes the United states out of that coalition it deterrent other western governments from speaking up as well\nOh so you're saying it's not just that the U.S is giving an implicit green light to these

today NPR's Joseph Shapiro takes us to a state that is rewriting the rules for discipline and women's prisons here's the sound we associate with prison [noise]\nHeavy steel doors shut\nThese are the doors at the entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women\nBut once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it there are no more heavy steel doors for the women that's not a family here because this prison is new evidence different inside the razor wire\nPlease cooks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from ... depending on what level there and that's the warning show Tom showing us around and do what we do that and the community is when I was parked outside in our yard with everything I guess it's still a prison\nThe warn that the first to point that out and prisons are still harsh places in some ways women's prisons are especially harsh because across the country women get\nTimes more likely to get in trouble for things like insulin disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch with NPR Emmett Till school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infraction can have big consequences women get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation of phone privileges\nThat matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today they could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt inside out and we're like why is that a charity shit that's really not a security issue maybe she had accomplished day I have one\nThat's the word and shovel dom in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to men of other Iowa prisons where three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive\nNow dom tells her corrections officers to give out fewer tickets like for breaking the rules about a prisoner can alter their uniform\nIt was written for men's prison were assured inside out or Swedes rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang related it's just women want to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nDominance putting in place of practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison\nEvery corrections officers being trained that women take different past the person they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent and that women do better when prison is less punitive\nSo Thomas changing the rules so especially about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more\nAnd to demand compliance west [noise]\nOn the mental health ward if he runs or is in charge of Bella a therapy dog a towering great Dane with us slate gray coat wonders an inmate she came to this prison twenty two years ago\nIt was really hard not to get in trouble back then you had to be careful of everything you sell like everything was [noise]\nThe dining hall and put a fire pillow sweet when crime happened [laughter] ... got punished for that banana\nPossession of stolen item [noise] yeah that was pretty rough\nWouldn't be a violation today but back then wonder says she lost good conduct credits those are days taken off are sentenced for good behavior and she lost privileges she couldn't buy things from the commissary\nCollender is serving time per second degree murder now she says the change in the way women are treated here help to grow she works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nTrying to contribute much institution so I'm not so much shame [noise]\nYou know and it helped me with my own\nMy own shame and my own regret\nThis psychiatric unit and the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about the large common room with bell on therapy animals there are large TV a garden and parts of natural light there are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now\nDr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nThere for so here in front of\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's presidents several years ago he quit his psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was the fees and psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all but he wasn't\nPrepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been changed for months at a time in the basement\nSold his property\nVictims of the panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison have long histories of being victims of violence too but research in general response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dump the Wharton\nMainly a correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker at a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape for fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are run\nFor which some concerns and what she said a word and there are some people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there is one of you to Ninety six women so let's talk about how that luck and how do we get in Ninety six cannot cash problems\nDom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old mental health ward is the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down [noise]\nAnd it's the one other place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now closed four years ago\nThere are ... sells a guard would watch separated from a station above when women with mental illness lived here they would often yellow into the night this is what President self today across the country you really look like for women or men\nUD humanize people and we put people that\nLive and breathe like us into a room that\nStrips them at all\nTheir senses are dignity\nThat gets back to white keeping up fewer disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for western fractions often lead the ending up in the cell block like this one Joseph Shapiro NPR News [noise]\nOr oh how women running prisons are making a difference in the way

Rocco Syria [noise]\nA couple of years ago scientists announced that they had found the oldest evidence of life and rocks that are three point seven billion years old separate group of researchers found that hard to believe me think of the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from the floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer with and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures are really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like or lack of a better word they kind of look like ... bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they used a proto type of an instrument that NASA\nIs planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nTwain and it's all good going from the perspective on it Maine\nThat would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils\nSo far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word\nNow Greenfieldboyce NPR News\n[noise]\nAnd you're listening to NPR News\nChina owns more U.S debt that any other

Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint had smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use our our ground\nAnswers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to Lynn Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nSo you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges and it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada and that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to parse this that there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grants from orange somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he hasn't diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where are you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law\nThat ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWhile I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nTo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which has taken a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\nLynn centers in immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today and Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state the rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened\nNPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThe garage doors shaking like somebody's trying to get in and the inside doors shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because everything was shaking I thought just hang in there and I said everything was going to be okay for when last\nDoors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact the same can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone the storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road high winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls\nQuite a few gate is the former head of FEMA and a long time in Britain see management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities on the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nAnd this is a part of Florida that's what I call the Florida is not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all generational of Florida families any of them or just said that Trump folks to fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters\nThey're just Seventy five miles per hour several years later Florida revised its statewide building code John history no structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on the probability of storms in the past and all of that it's sort of a goes down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction need only would stand when speed one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less\nFar below the one hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael in the aftermath of the storm has local state and federal officials assess the damage\nA consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter David provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that spent the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael impact\nWhat we saw the damage to pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of housing what was not damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig Fugate has long believed the wind speeds standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nAnd if you had that store back in and out particularly yet Michael back in is going to force a much higher in ... for the coast well in land based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now in the process of revising the state code and it's a wedding recommendations from the University of Florida team led by David provide provide says understanding how to build resilience structures is just the first step\nWe know what can be done it has been proven over such as it is a way that a company that she is willing to adopt a notch\nRealtors homebuilders the insurance industry and many others will have a voice as forty considers how to prepare the panhandle for the next

should consider factors including race Kelly ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered great thanks for having me why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race merely treat an illusion of diversity and I'd love to eat emissions policies change not to have race it\nNo Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors that they consider it's complicated role in the student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from the list of factors that Harvard is considering wanted assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raised to sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but what infer fed missions has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents Missouri's missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal ratings artificially keep their numbers lower although they were going higher and everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case have alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost at the front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think of that argument\nI Do think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's been said discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally ... said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial there was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite the barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nGot a lot of admissions process or should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important but I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at night in the context of race but again like I said\nMarried in the context as economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division and sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about ... thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks for having me she's a junior at Harvard and you are listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe state of
