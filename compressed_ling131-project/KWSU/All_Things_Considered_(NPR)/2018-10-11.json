Wall street today us stocks on their biggest fell off in six months the Dow fell eight hundred thirty one points which is a three percent decline here to talk about the exactly what happened in NPR's John Ydstie hatred I also what made the market plummeted eh\nYeah I was a tough day a and a number of things contributed let's start with interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous and in fact uh this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred\nA rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go the Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it will stop praising benchmark rate between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get there\nIs no way I understand it said usually raises rates to stave off inflation right or their fears and inflation right now\nWell Federal Reserve chair a drone policy has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at fifty year low so there's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation\nPressures so you're saying the economy remains strong such shouldn't that be good for the stock\nMarket economy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today's sell off is not the end of the bowl marketing stocks here but while the U.S economy remains strong Europe has cooled a bit as have emerging markets and the IMF\nGave a lesson glowing assessment of the global economy this week or less going to do just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are concerns about a global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies the U.S and China and that hurts stocks\nAre there any particular area is that the market that had been hurt by the style off\nFor virtually all sectors of the markets sold off today a wiping out all their stock\nStations with this ball market in fact uh the tech heavy NASDAQ index the last four percent of its value today\nAnd asking the five hundred which also has a lot of tax lost three and a ... percent\nSo it's been a very tough day for tech and very tough day right is it just the beginning of along down there trying for the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so Trump said dispelling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down\nWas due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling\nA given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American business as it's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down\nBut we are at a point where investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession we're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough that the interest rates they're paying is starting to compete with stocks\nWill see how foreign markets absorbed is tomorrow and then the U.S market will have another\nCrack at it and we'll see what happens [noise] hey

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly\nAt least six people have been killed since hurricane Michael blasted ashore yesterday the category for storm left a huge trail of destruction along the Florida Panhandle\nIncluding in the coastal community of Mexico beach which is where we find NPR's Greg Allen not fun lions in Mexico beach are understandably not great but we think we've got you hey there Greg [noise]\nHi Mary Louise how bad is it [noise] well\nIt's what you would expect to you know it was a category ... storm nearly a category five when I came ashore right here the I passed right over this this area and Mexico beach which is a very small community you know the storm surge came in and you can see signs of every of everywhere there's still lots of standing water here most of the water went out but there's still plenty of it around\nBut it was those when you're a hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds just tore our hearts many buildings here lifted up entire buildings through them down on other ones you saw roofs off you know fighting off sides off um luckily the most people have had left and weren't here to Seattle\nAnd are you able to drive around them in the streets\nBad getting here is another matter you know we came over from Tallahassee today it should be a couple of hours\nMy producer Becky Sullivan and I took us nine hours to get here because you just don't know what roads are open and when the roads are open they're just barely open you have to drive around this round down trees your power crews out and in in ... and good Samaritans doing what they can but it's still very hard slog get in or out of this area\nRight what about the impact on people I mean there's always with the storms some people said they rode out the storm I assume you've been out talking to them what are they saying [noise]\nYeah I mean it's it's a tough one I talked\nTo him a man here who stayed and he said he left in hurricane oval which was in Nineteen Ninety five and he always regretted it so hard to get back into the community later he always where he'd states we stayed and he said the strong as anything he was prepared for it or had ever experienced before you know the the sound the noise the\nThe windows the walls flexing and he had a little safer and built for himself and his paths\nAt one point he said it became so Steve something told him that this was no longer safe and they moved to an ... a bathroom and that happened windows shattered glass blasted and he said they certainly would have been injured if they had been the case\nAnd he kind of struggled to patch of his window and rode out the rest of the storm and ah today he's here repairing his house with a neighbor and I asked him if he was sorry that he stayed he says no he'd do it again because he says if I didn't stay there all my mature all my possessions everything will get ruined by the rain and the other stuff coming in\nAnd what about the people who did evacuate is there any kind of timeframe on when they might be able to come home [noise]\nUh no I don't I'm not not yet as far as I Know when you arrive engulf a county here you get an alert on your cell phone telling you that only for responders are allowed in the county at this point that they do that even private even people who live here residents are not allowed back and so there's road blocks that many all the the major intersections\nAnd many many people are being turned away um it to their frustration so it's they're worried about the safety because they're still wires down um everywhere here so it's it's it's it's safety first and it's going to be some time I think for people were allowed back\nA NPR's Greg Allen reporting in Mexico Beach Florida we hope you stay safe thanks so much You're welcome\nWhen would be the next chance you could go on a mission like that again I mean I Can't imagine a psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused and professional and doing their job but afterwards\nThey're just going to be kinda mad because they didn't get to go to the base today you know kind of like gosh all that preparation that David ... but neither of them got hurt and they're they're back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again garden I don't know who will fly\nNext it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what's skill sets should we need one is that going to be all of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of information people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem manufacturing problem who knows that and once you know that you could fix it then you can set a timeline is that the ...\nOther plants and Boeing is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nNew understanding respecting to return home and now that return could
