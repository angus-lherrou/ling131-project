decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're her effect you know murders of children things like that it just [noise] things that need to be solved\nAnd grey tech says it's not nearly as easy as that new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is a New York university law professor\nIf it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your distant cousins for people you don't even know you're related to your children for your children children\nSo Murphy and others think better ways are needed to protect people's DNA to make sure it isn't misused Rob Stein NPR News [noise]\nKeeping the Columbia River safe use up the Koran several public meetings scheduled for Seattle and Portland next week it on us to do with decisions being made hundreds of miles away in the desert of Hanford\nCorrespondent king tackled this question how do you keep them mostly empty radioactive waste tank safe for hundreds of thousands even millions of years\nFifty six million gallons of radioactive waste and Hanford it's stored in aging underground tanks from World war two and the Cold War\nIt's all not far from the Columbia River these waste tanks that Hanford are huge some of them could fit a three storey house inside\nThere are a hundred and Seventy seven tanks altogether and most of them are single shelves or have a single whole\nMany of these tanks have leaked radioactive waste into the soil like at least a million gallons worth\nBut some the federal government has been able to pretty much empty transferring the waste into slightly sturdier tanks so now the question is how can the feds close these emptied out tanks for the long haul like keep them safe for thousands of years\nBruce cap over them to protect them from moisture idea is if you keep the water away the remaining wasteful just sit there and we'll move the only problem the board is very concerned\nAbout the level of contamination that will remain on the site\nThat Susan ... the chair of the Hanford advisory board to have as it's known around here is a group of stakeholders that watches over clean up at the site and give them the feds states advice\nLooked inside us when the federal government cleans out those tanks they aren't that clean really there will be about Seventy thousand gallons of waste left and just one group of tanks called the sea farm\nThe federal government wants to crowd over that and we're also concerned about the fact that\nWe're not sure that the ground they put in there will actually mixed with the waste and become a talented impenetrable waste to form so that it won't leak in to the water table\nOregon and Washington state officials are also worried they say the federal government is looking at to narrow slice of Hanford when it calculates its total chemical and radioactive waste risk to the Columbia River\nThe states in the feds are counting all the other ways that Hanford like the stuff that leaked out of the tanks already and other scary waste sites like pits where the government just used to pour radioactive liquid into the desert\nAnd all that waste has created plumes of contamination that continually move toward the aquifer in Columbia River that's the total load\nIf you leave waste behind on site you weren't adding to the eventual burden on the ground water under Hanford and ultimately the Columbia River\nThat's just bright he helps watch over Hanford clean up for the state of Oregon and the state is very invested in what happens at hand for an answer the Columbia\nAnother issue grounding is really permanent measure that's like concrete it's likely those massive blocks would remain in place maybe forever or at least for thousands of years hundreds of generations from now that's how long it would take for the radioactive waste to cool down some\nOregon's bright says it's really hard to plan for a million years of climate change civilization change and things we just don't know\nThere are the things we know and then to borrow from Donald Rumsfeld there are the unknown unknowns that we need to make sure we're managing overtime\nThis decision is important\nOn a scale of a million years bright says it's the things we don't know that could harm future generations that depend on the Columbia River I'm Anna King in Richland\nThere are several

for western Washington most likely with patchy fog after midnight east to the cascades clear skies with locally gusty conditions blows across the northwest in the mid thirties to the upper forties\n\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered an outfit Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly this is a war zone and that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today we begin this hour taking stock of the devastation\nWe stir industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg I'm Mary Louise said tell me what these two towns to look like today\nWell you know these are this area is somewhat east where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove in today my producer Becky Sullivan I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nUh here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble some it already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as it were there before the storm we also people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight and it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's the section that runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns and it's been damaged in in several places\nAnd it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckled up under washed them and a half an hour yeah you have watched it out\nThere also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was damaged now open to single lane but that said there is now a pathway through apple electrical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in Appalachian coal no power no ... very limited cell service and no outside help you out\nAnd and I mentioned these two towns are the hardest or Easter industry they've got fishing going on there a lot of fishing and they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them\nI mean wasters along a mainstay there that they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf but also you know shrimping and fishing or big hear many people moved their boats upriver to a secluded\nSeafood restaurants in

two years\nAndrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made a pastor Brunson case a priority men Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely to moral as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there and\nI'm Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly he been convicted up\nWell his pastor around a small church in is mere in western turkey for years and years ah\nBut after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to the Gulen turkey blames for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless\nBut he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now and then today in court we had three witnesses who would testified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence\nRemoved restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why released him and why released him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean\nThere were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey and of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the ... who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us\nAgreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest then the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement that the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey\nWill lay re raised this issue of extra dieting the clerics are to the Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi

bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House\nOr at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise] it was about to attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nTrail started as Scott Horsley with at the White House working story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freaked does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nAre mystery why courtship getting works at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Frito is owned by Pepsi Pepsi ... which makes ...\nSo we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay find things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a note left at the scene of the\nCrime to our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nTo offset increases we've received in product costs for manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost of the free does have gone off and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free do there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how\nNaive to think that's all that kind of aggravated Carolyn Dmitri it's an applied economist at NYU who specializes in suits studies she says the price of a process food like free does\nHas almost nothing to do with well food prices care is a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation speakers trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine\nMight suddenly cost a lot more we just shipping costs for not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma below capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi\nAnd another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies I Know when I'm um because of the parent has gone up as well\nBecause it might be a woman in in the can yeah\nIf the U.S is not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much with overseas aluminium suppliers\nSo the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices above the company's Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs that maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset is more expensive can\nBut they can't really do that right now they own so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what tracks\nBacking category alive many of the other cat agrees that allow companies that make back\nThey can so they're trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks as a best guess for why you're free does went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying as the bag of ...

NPR station it's\nAll things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I know that Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl world has been under tremendous pressure\nDiocese were accused of mishandling several cases of abuse like that I see a Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nUrged state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds recognition what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWill cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse\nI actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church I think what's missing here though is an acknowledgement by the Vatican\nOn the extent of the abuse and cover up in\nPennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it\nNow I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think that the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations view you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who's living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nThat would expect it completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecute crimes harder to Cape becomes\nAs a lawyer of course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case\nAnd yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet\nThe law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance Catholic Church but there's so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up actual abuse from to protect abusers\nDoes reviving the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally at the institution where\nYou hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation\nAbove the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to hold powerful\nInstitutions accountable and I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique and critical role in that process that's\nWhat we're doing here in Pennsylvania and\nJoshua Shapiro is Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us thank you\n[noise] some of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be revealed\nA federal judge in Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers helped to advance the impeachment effort aimed at president Richard Nixon and scholars say they are relevant today as another special counsel investigating the current administration NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nA few years after the resignation of Richard Nixon the special prosecutor who investigated him recalled it\nTo get the courts to promote the grand jury report to go to the house Judiciary Committee because if somebody would have had real difficulty and doing it's worth ... haven't gotten all the brown\nLeon Jaworski told an interviewer in Nineteen Seventy seven that document contained in detail list of the evidence the Watergate prosecution team had gathered\nWe called the road map in our office because last just us\nFor forty four years that road map remained as secret under seal by the federal district court in Washington on orders of the judge who presided over the Watergate cases\nThat secrecy persisted to protect the grand jury's work but not for lack of trying in Nineteen Ninety seven Stephen ... was working for the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton base was looking for a precedent for how a special prosecutor might send an impeachment referral to Congress\nThe national archives let me see a lot of stuff from the Watergate special that was very interesting when I asked you to load and that was set up to the house I the worse if they said no\nBates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry ...\nIs relevant historians it's relevant to the infringement ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public record\nUrgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign and one of the big questions about the end of Robert Mueller's investigation is whether he'll try to send to report to Congress or the public John sale worked on Watergate as a young lawyer\nOn twenty first century variation of the Silk Road that is something that the lower team story likely considered\nSales boss on the Watergate team was James corals to now serves as mothers deputy\nBut he says unlike Richard Nixon Donald Trump's legal team is likely to object to any such material going to Congress\nTrump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has already signaled he would fight in court to stop lawmakers from seeing that document meanwhile the battle over the Watergate roadmap could soon come to an end\nThis week judge barrel how ordered the national archives to review it

vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also\nHow usual is it for the president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush to president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy that maybe didn't call them if they'd crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it [noise] but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known privately to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay do up until now fed officials had been defending the saddest from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate hike\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society and the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nUh with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always in the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing do\nYou think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president and how the way the fed to slow down the rate hike\nOr no I don't think the president's words will effect\nThe Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis information using the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be spending where\nI think it's very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up his attacks\nAnd others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation so I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting\nIn their best interests like you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime chairman power ceases worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill trying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's\nOversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's as well as explaining to the American people I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding that's Donald ... the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of
