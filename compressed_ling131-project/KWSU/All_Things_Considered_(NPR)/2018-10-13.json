this is all things considered an alpha Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly this is a war zone that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida oyster industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise said tell me what these two towns look like\nWell you know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove in today my producer Becky Sullivan I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nUh here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble um some it already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as it were there before the storm we also\nThese are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's affectionate runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns and it's been damaged in in several places\nAnd it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of that the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckle under wash them and that happened out yeah yeah I watched it out\nThere also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was damaged now open to single lane but that said there is now a pathway through apple logical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but they they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point\nBut in ... no power no very limited cell service and no outside help you\nGo out and and I mentioned these two towns are the heart of the or Easter industry they've got fishing going on there a lot of fishing and they they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them\nRight I mean ... along the mainstay there but they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf\nBut also you know shrimping and fishing or big hear many people do their boats upriver to a secluded area Heidi hold they call it keep it out of harm's way and so most boats escaped major damage that's good but some of the seafood restaurants and wholesalers worked with a lot of damage are working to rebuild and be back in business as soon as they can\n[laughter] as NPR's Greg Allen reporting for us from Florida Today and all this week Greg thanks so much you walk them\nAll right let's move now to the political storm that had correct Washington in the country last week he did a storm that

Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July President Trump made it pastor Brunson case a priority and Brunson is expected\nLikely tomorrow as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul had Eric Hi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nWell his pastor around a small church in is mayor in western turkey for years and years\nBut after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric ... turkey blames for that to attempt\nTo us to the charges were baseless\nBut he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now and then today in court we had three witnesses who would testified against him suddenly changing their earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that incensed a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence\nRemoved restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[laughter] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why released him and why really him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the ... who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with air to one and reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept mounting and then we had this court case and that was released\nA lot of moving parts obviously in the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's his church that he was running and turkey\nAbsolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but well for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue\nIn Syria and other things possible murder the Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing this stumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nDid you mark a showcase right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table [noise] thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul we can\nTake the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ten rules reaching all the way to the White House\nOr at least to the White House press corps vending machine it was brought to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nTrail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freaked does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to in the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nAre mystery why corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos it's owned by Pepsi Pepsi ... which makes ... in fact the machines got uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay fine downs thanks I now apple luckily there was a second clue a note lasted the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nTo offset increases we ever received in product costs for manufacturers so present was wholesale cost of the free does have gone up when they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nAnd saw well how\nTo think that's all that's in a bag afraid Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies\nKilled is a much bigger part of the cost of the food like free does it and things like labor and rent and transportation\nBecause trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost\nA lot more we just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi and another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about a soft drink companies I Know one of them um because of the parent has gone up as well\nBecause of like the aluminum can yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nOf all the companies that looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by a woman ... see maybe Pepsi or coke could just raised the price of their drinks do off that is more expensive can but they can't really do that right now feels as though to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nTracking category unlike many of the other categories that allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so they're trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks at your best guess for why you're free does went up a quarter Scott Horsley sets satisfying it's not as satisfying as the\nBag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise] [noise] that's good for him [noise]\nThat\nWith NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley speaking with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the podcast the indicator\nFrom Planet Money more money comes from for why a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to send receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore transfer wise dot com\nUh Internet researchers amassed the identities of the Russians who were poisons poisons several people in the u._k. and they're eager to share their methods\nWe firmly believe that it's so important that more people are aware of how to do this kind of things and most of the times it's not too hard\nTo learn more on how they were able to track down the criminals at five forty [noise]\nFor the police San Louis Clark valley a dry cold front tonight brings breezy conditions into Saturday was gossip to twenty five miles per hour otherwise who the weekend and much of next week you can expect sunny days clear nights and dry weather with possible frost forming overnight and in the morning flows and the thirties to low forties and I was in the mid fifties to mid sixties\nA big thank you to everyone who supports northwest public broadcasting and a warm welcome I'll give you a big hug\nBack in September of British authorities held a press conference they released passport photo said names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIs likely so they were traveling underwriters ...\nTo a guy like Eric told her that sounded like a challenge towler works for a group called spelling cat his job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it\nSomething like digital researcher digital investigator digital something probably works\nTolerant as friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line they've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese airbases watch security operation some fold on social media in Venezuela pinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nCaught because those guys you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook\nBut remember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy the trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise]\nWhen you look at these photos on there on our on our website and it's just a bunch of Russian just random Russian guys going through and kind of fight saying it to the military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they like photographing is it's wall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis was a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russian person uploaded photos shows are boy ...

athletic she industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball shoe at him\nSo they had it for a in Ninety eight\nThey've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these\nElements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really hat and so ... that's a big part of the appeal with tapping in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also I think a big thing for them as as a brand and as we look on to China and how they can make their mark their\nBasketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how did they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and it didn't they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and the prime gene who may even in a position to be going after a name like that raining\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdles for any newcomer\nYeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year Nike had about sixty percent of the week wearing their shoes last oh okay I'm step in and combat that is pretty tough but okay [laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSix of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with an old aren't into mark his cousin so [noise] you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they are looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble for a company like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out man there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media if you've gotten a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever [laughter] and it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken to that in ... made a kind of fun\nYou know by about why is it more important and families how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue banned in what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching lots and lots of folks who our game and they're really kind of immersing more and what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights on Instagram of things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys at Pomona signed\nThey have six and a half million to bind followers on Instagram so that's a huge base of the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself is only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really lenient on their players counts and ethical\nTrying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and stuff so that is going to be a huge\nPush for sure [noise] ... the

Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign as a report this summer detailed the abused more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of handling several cases of abuse lot the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the manual prepared that gave him horrific report\nPennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro urged state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds recognition what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step\nA given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church I think what's missing here though is an acknowledgement by the Vatican\nOn the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop\nColonel politics to them and their parishioners but I I Do not think that the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agreed with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nBut with respect to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witness has passed away memories fade evidence grounds down any of that concern you at a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when a number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who were abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes\nForward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution and this isn't like Catholic Church but there's so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse to protect us\nThe lady internally at these institutions you hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation\nAbove the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to hold powerful\nInstitutions accountable and I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on but the me too movement the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful\nInstitutions accountable in law enforcement plays a unique and critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania and\nJoshua Shapiro is Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us thank you [noise]\nSome of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be revealed a federal judge in Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers helped to advance the impeachment effort aimed at president Richard Nixon and scholars say they are relevant today as another special counsel investigating the current administration NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nA few years after the resignation of Richard Nixon the special prosecutor who investigated him recalled the critical moment and that probe\nMoron laws from the waist succeeded which was first in history to get the courts to let the grand jury report to go to the house Judiciary Committee because the committee would have had real difficulty and doing it's worth of the way behind it hasn't gotten all the

office because it was just that\nFor forty four years that road map remained secret\nUnder seal by the federal district court in Washington on orders of the judge who presided over the Watergate cases\nThat secrecy persisted to protect the grand jury's work but not for lack of trying in Nineteen Ninety seven Stephen ... was working for the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton base was looking for a precedent for how a special prosecutor might send an impeachment referral to Congress\nNational Archives let me see a lot of stuff from\nAt up to the house I worse if they said no\nBates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry ... stone\nIt's relevant historians it's relevant to the intrinsic ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public\nRecord urgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign in one of the big questions about the end of Robert Mueller's investigation is whether he'll try to send to report to Congress or the public John sale worked on Watergate and the young lawyer\nTwenty first century variation of the Silk Road map is something that the Mueller team started likely considered\nSales boss on the Watergate team was James corals to now serves as mothers deputy\nBut he says unlike Richard Nixon Donald Trump's legal team is likely to object to any such
