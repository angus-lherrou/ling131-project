any interference in the twenty sixteen election and back then he also offered an alternative theory of the case where he said someone weighing four hundred pounds sitting on his bed could have been the hacker of the Democratic party emails\nSo clearly the president's instinct is to defend dictators\nSo real killers as maybe the update on the four hundred pound guy ... okay and I mentioned the

things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish we're spending a few days looking at a striking disparity in prisons across the United states women are disciplined more frequently and often more harshly than men that's the finding of an investigation by NPR and the ... school of journalism at Northwestern university\nNPR's Joseph Shapiro and reporter Jessica ... found that women are punished disproportionately from minor infractions those violations can have major repercussions like the loss of good conduct credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states it all but two women get this one of the higher rates than men [noise] what's most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison rules at\nRates we estimated often two to three times higher\nFor what prisons classified of smaller fraction petty stuff\nYou can get written up for a not closing your door you've written up for jumping on the phone without permission or if you just want to just picture room a knife and just take some lady die you appeal the case you get written up to that subject tortilla Williams and it made up of central California women facility\nCharge show a California you get written up I'm going out of bounds\nGet written up for our numbers show that in California women compared to men get twice the disciplinary tickets for disobeying in order and more than twice as many for what's called disrespect in Vermont we've had a women are more than three times as likely to get in trouble for making what's called derogatory comments\nIn Rhode Island they get more than three times the tickets for disobedience\nThose tickets have consequences women lose good conduct credits like I have time at it to their stay in prison or lose phoning visitation privileges or go to solitary confinement in Rhode Island women were more than three times as likely as men to end up in solitary confinement for disobedience\n[noise] prisons were built for men and the rules for discipline were set up to control those ... D and ... says\nThose rules don't work very well with women\nYou walk through a women's prison and it's a profoundly different experience we\nMet ... shoes visiting Logan Correctional Center a women's prison in Illinois several years ago ... was a top official in the Illinois department of corrections now she works with prisons as a consultant she helps them address that problem of why women in prison get discipline more\nWomen are more communicative when you walk to a prison Barrymore emotional they want to talk to you they want to talk about their children that want to talk about their experiences\nTwo years ago ... does help conduct an audit about women's prison in Illinois and found that women prisoners were disciplined almost twice as often as men for all offenses big and small but almost five times more likely to get in trouble for a lesser offense called minor influence\nAnd they also released a scene in ... states with another ... or something that happened they want to fix it like they want to be the mom that's going to come in and mediate between people and fix that problem\n... Toto says she likes it that women prisoners are this way but she said many corrections officers and often even in a women's prison most of them are men say they hate it\nThe first thing that they'll tell you is these women are so difficult gosh they're a pain I Would rather work anywhere but here they always want to talk to you they won't take no for an answer\nCorrections officers are trained to keep control they expect women to be compliant if the women pushback mass where those disciplinary tickets for influence come in to women and we met in Illinois told us they'd been written up some years ago for an infraction called reckless I bowling\nIllness those were a lesbian bisexual or transgender African American women especially for those lesser non violent offenses\n... ... a guard out that they asked on me that I write or yeah stuff like that\nTitanic Williams was Nineteen when she went to prison in Illinois after repeatedly missing her court ordered nine pm curfew at our foster care facility in prison after a fight with an inmate Williams was charged with hitting an officer who tried to stop at her sentence was doubled from two years before\nBut most of her tickets for cursing and talking back to officers and those kept her in prison for extra days and she lost privileges\nOne time she says she got in trouble for cursing at a guard when her soul mate who had diabetes passed out we've solved the officer was too slow to help Williams says the hardest thing was when she lost her phone privileges and she couldn't call her son he was a baby when she went to prison and he was growing up without her\nIt was bad because I'm here I Am\nI missing her polling\nHe's nine now but Titanic Williams says that time separated often not even able to talk to him on the phone makes it hard to be a parent now\nEven if they are the consequences are our ... our number here it is hard right of course there are no other thing on my blog on that and my family our family my current the current you guys are\nMore than half of women in prison or the mothers of children under the age of Eighteen one common punishment up at Illinois prison was that women last good conduct credits in one year alone twenty Fifteen women most Ninety three years of those credits that's twenty extra days or prison time for each woman\nThat's an average many women had no days added but some ended up with months even a year or more affected your time [noise]\nA small number of states including Illinois or trying to change this\nThey're trying what's called gender response of corrections practices it's built around the idea that women are in prison for different reasons than men that they respond differently in prison and that prison rules need to recognize those differences in the last ...\nFound out\nThat prison in Illinois a trainer at the front of a classroom tells corrections\nShe just asked\nMe how to deal with this with\nPhone privileges revoked all she can do is write a letter home or to her son's school\nIt's reminder to the corrections officers had tickets even once for a lesser offenses can have significant consequences reporter Jessica papa back meant officers that that training they didn't want to give their names they said the gender response of approach makes sense to them but that many of their co workers are much more skeptical\nI was I heard a lot of things but they're worthless we're going to work as a big\nHug a thug that's a derogatory way of saying to letting the inmates run the prison we wrote letters to some of the women at that Illinois prison\nOne woman who wrote back said that says the training started she's not seen much difference she said corrections officers both men and the women are disrespectful and cruel\nAnd this was a quote there on a power trip cause bitches hose they tried to provoke you if you say anything back they send you the segregation for threats and intimidation\nThe number of women in prison is rising but still they're only about seven percent of the prison population nationwide so it's hard to get prison officials to make their problems are priority like the heavy punishment of women for those
