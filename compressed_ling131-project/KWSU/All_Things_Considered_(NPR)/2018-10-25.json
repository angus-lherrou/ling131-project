we're joined by NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas Hey Ryan either okay so take me through this the FBI said there were five potential explosive devices that they're also report this morning\n[noise] that's right so the FBI says that the envelopes were address to George Soros he's a billionaire big contributor to democratic causes a Hillary Clinton Brock Obama Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder\nAnd his former CIA director John Brennan the package that was intended for Brennan was sent to CNN's New York office right on not clear why that was but\nYes there were other people who said they received ... suspicious packages today one of them was in New York governor Andrew Cuomo who is a Democrat his office later said however uh that the package it didn't contain any sort of suspicious explosives another was California congresswoman Maxine Waters\nRemoved and is being investigated by the FBI right now we don't know whether the FBI didn't mention her because her package a doesn't belong with the others or perhaps it would just was received too late in the clear at this point but the FBI did say in a statement on Wednesday that ah it's possible that there are more suspicious packages out there or that it doesn't know that at this point\nSo what do we know about the five packages that the FBI discounts in ...\nWell a law enforcement official described him as pipe bombs earlier today in the case of the ones that the CNN or the package also is said to have contained to white powder\nNow the FBI itself says that all of the explosive devices were mailed and he's identical bubble wrap envelopes\nThe address is on the packages were computer printed the return address on all of them was as you mentioned for Wasserman Schultz although her

chance\nWe're going to go now to a region of the country that's been labeled tragically suicide belt\nSuicide rates are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said the news on one\nStates with the highest suicide rate NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it at the\nConfluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of a valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock lifts you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding now and I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life inside in Grand junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together at another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know pick up a bear bootstraps mentality and\nKathy evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have in our home because my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act the old way wasn't working\nVictoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialized the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to\nOne of dozens of pure mentors and the districts news sources of strength suicide prevention program\nShe's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble and these are not junior psychologist but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the sides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired as suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers the bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year\nWhat are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health and starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier\nIn classrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning

others\nShe says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad suicide\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's tough to share that like a lot easier and if it helps other people hope I don't mind sharing\nGoing on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid in for that matter the entire\nHere's one person in the community just watching all of this is Carissa school she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband as suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who had been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nStools husband grew up here was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer he was a community leader seen as a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess that's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men like tools husband or ... dad an uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Morris is the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well you have a super powerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to creating social movement and changing social norms and changing

running on her record she's running away from her record on health care and putting her party's needs above our\nCongress is broken right now she's the leader of a Congress that has blown a huge hole in the budget not dealt with health care or immigration and even left town without a farm bill\nWe can do better I Want to go to Congress and work with are farmers veterans students seniors and defend our healthcare\nUm work for solutions not just talking points eastern Washington deserves an advocate that has more ah for ah getting things done than simply standing up for party priorities\n[noise]\nThank you [noise] we began our debate tonight with the economy but you add it currently experiencing robot economic growth locally unemployment that at twenty eight year low and consumer spending is picking up\nHowever the federal deficit is also growing by Seventeen percent this past year and trade agreements with our long term trading partners are undergoing significant change it the first question to you that\nWhat do you see as the direction of the economic growth and what actions had the current Congress taken that you consider to be beneficial or harmful to stay in about economic growth you have sixty seconds thanks\nI'm Glad we're starting with the economy we really have more than one economy in eastern Washington we have northeast Washington's natural resource based economy a health science economy in Spokane and an agricultural economy here in southeast Washington\nUnfortunately this Congress has acted irresponsibly as I mentioned doubling the national debt in two years\nI'm a get a longer term visa\nThinking cat hair question regarding immigration\nLast year President Trump's administration ended the DACA program and since then Congress has not regard to the ongoing crisis in which hundreds of thousands of young people including many young people young people in our valley find themselves first first part of the question is do you support DACA\nAnd secondly what do you say to people who ask you what is going to happen to my family and friends I have\nMet with many DACA individuals over the last year and and beyond that\nWe needed to give DACA individuals' certainty and I have been negotiated legislation voted on legislation to give them give DACA the certainty because many came here no fault of their own and there and they need to have that certainty\nNinety percent of those that come to America legally our family reunification refugees\nUm and and our uh and we need a merit based a visa and that's the solution that I have helped draft and supported in Congress\nSo that if someone was in school if they were working or if they were had joined the military that they would be able to get a visa and then over a period of time get a permanent status get in line to be to get citizenship if they would like to do that that's the part of the solution that I've promoted\nAnd I am committed to working in a ... a bipartisan way to get immigration reform done\nUh [noise] because over a year ago you said that these DACA\nA student's deserved a path forward and you're in leadership and your party is in control of both houses of Congress and the presidency so there is no reason to be talking about what you support or what you negotiated bring the bill forward and it will pass [noise]\nThank you [noise] next question is regarding women race\nAnd me too movement encourages women to speak out about sexual harassment and sexual violence and hold perpetrators accountable to the moon has also been that with the backlash with it being criticized it's having gone too far\nIs that what do you think is the proper place for the me too movement are we making progress with regard to changing the culture surrounding sexual harassment or are we actually regretting as a result of a movement gone too far well we're not\nRegret saying we have made progress but there's so much more to make when I first moved to Spokane I joined with others and we took on the first women take back the night march to bring up the reality of domestic violence which was not necessarily talked about with hidden and swept under the rug\nI serve on the board of the of the YWCA in Spokane and it is sad to understand how many relationships are are separate because of domestic violence and how much family violence there is\nAnd we need to talk about it we need more than having a victims of domestic violence have their stories be told they also deserves justice and due process\nAnd a independent investigations and we need to hold the perpetrators accountable and we need to raise our girls and boys in a new way to prevent future domestic violence\nThank you hear that um [noise] I Believe that those that have been involved in domestic violence sexual assault sexual abuse they need to know that they have a place that they can go and that they can ... and edited a safe place and that is\nWhen when the me too movement was was sweeping the country we had our own situations on Capitol Hill and I led we got\nPlace where they could go his dad was a an office that would give them that that they place I think it's very important that women know that they this is not acceptable and they have a place they can do\nThink you Kathy your question regarding women's rights [noise] what do you want the future to

our people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation\nAuthorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded\nA air had the potential to explode

clue they're\nA former official at the ATF the bureau of\nAlcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives was reviewed some images of these devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people and intimidate them and did that was that happening\nFor political or personal reasons all of a big focus at this investigation All right so if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect is at this briefing in New York investigators we're not talking about individuals suspects here's what we do know\nI investigators are focusing some resources on New York and some others in Florida\nRemember these packages had to return address in Florida specifically to the office of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz shelters not actually linked to these packages she didn't send them but whoever did made her part of the story and there is another reason why authorities are focused on Florida at least some of these homemade\nInvestigators are involved here to trying to trace that and the postal service representative has just told us and the

Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you or Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system and then she was partly because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have it as being legal immigration system that works and where there are there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as the so called caravan makes its way north\nMexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S sport are so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] uh I'm nobody's called a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year\nFlood of individuals coming from Central America is unaccompanied children and I was ... units set of eyes by laws we passed by

let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats [noise] want caravans they liked the care of and it's a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change the law so we can and these incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people from this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counter productive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from there to ask you the direct question that is on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energized Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this the curtain ... people are opposed to a prison and is down there and be in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role

where does the investigation stand at this point into these packages\nOr you have a really a full force of law enforcement trying to figure out why this happened who was behind this uh this includes the FBI they might pd also the secret service and as you mentioned there are ten packages they're found in New York Florida Delaware California, Maryland this is really sprawling\nAnd law enforcement of trying to put together all these different pieces that they've collected from these packages there either all center on their way to FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia and they're trying to really look at the details here\nUh uh the eyes Williams Sweeney talked about that really today let's listen to what he said\nA powder in those particular ... did not present a biological for other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating it any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nYou know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details of what they found out so far you know they're characterizing these devices that quote suspected explosive devices or else imbedded away any questions that possibly any of these\nExplosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intent there they're focusing an investigation or asking for tips from the public\nAre there specific threads law enforcement officials are pursuing right now\nWell one big question is where these packages sent through the poster system or some of them because they've been delivered by a cure your\nAnd also what were the materials used for these explosive devices I spoke with a former ATF agents and he said that really they're looking at trying to find signatures that may be able to identify who who was the individual or individuals behind this\nAnd also they're looking at a closed circuit TV footage to see if they have any indication of who may be involved and you really can't rule out that there may be more packages out there and so that's something that a postal workers and law enforcement or on the lookout for\nIn the meantime what more is known about the packages that were found today in Delaware

host of the nine AM our stage show she was having a chat a couple of days ago with several panelist about Halloween costumes and talks about how she's not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say [laughter]\nYou'll get in trouble if you are a white person who by the time or a black person if I got a white lie that was okay as long as you address character\nAnd that of course at tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by whites\nHow did her fell NBC

we have this conversation year after\nYear within um we do every year unquote which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface Avon and not all the way you advocate Halloween is is Christmas at all companies on this one day of the year when all the races costume and comes out and maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether black faces bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as\nWell walk us through some of the history as best when did we first started saying black in America\nWe first start saying in the early Eighteen hundreds on may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like by people by talking in the skin with polish and with court\nAnd of course these missiles food depicted by people with lazy as animal is to play caricatures played the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad humidity shouldn't allow slavery to happen at the time and so these caricatures linger and the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ... and\nIt's the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black\nThere's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow fever portrayals of Asian American pie and think of Mickey Rooney character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it does mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy set against\nThat and to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people that were being caricatured\nOr the people who are caffeine caricatured ... often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and that's what shows who are not wearing black was because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\nTo track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history [noise] what do you make of that\nI mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and the panel is all white and I went to the port and she seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people may dress up in blackface\nAnd that happens all the time and have conversations about race in history and power they always become conversations about intent and not about sort of broader context we always start in a historical vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up and we are because they were a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so when he's controversy tend to happen it's usually when a person you know showed up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there is not a black person and attendance and no one at that party made bad an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and men that video has to contend with\nA different context with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery as well maybe these conversations\nWill be better served if we spent less time parsing out what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people are not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team thank you thank you so

the woods according to authorities\nHelping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear your regular basic argument boils down to if the U.S cut foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to leave yes\nSo if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs and Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador in their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up at dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day that we need to be active around the world and these are places\nIn our hemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so\nWe should be looking here near to home\nFor places that do affect a day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is that the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back to central\nAmerica United States has a long history of involvement in Central America\nHappening the contracts were there and we are big supporters of the group and then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now ... national in nature they're in Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and said those linkages\nAre not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nation\nSo if you could wave a magic wand and tell the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you\nTell them that I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce style and improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these government accountable in Central America\nMake those government actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because in in the end it is the responsibility of the Central American government to\nProtect their people chanted O'Neill of the council on Foreign Relations so much my pleasure

of the brain may have been under estimated a new study suggests it also helps us manage everything from emotions to social interactions to planning NPR's Jon Hamilton has more\nCerebellum doesn't get much respect scientists often dismiss it as that part of the brain that lets you pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico dose in boxes they found some surprising\nHigher order cognitive functions\nWhat kind of cognitive functions Scott America post doc and doesn't box lab offers some examples abstract\nThinking forward planning even holding something in memory producing the words that you're saying it's important for all of his day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seem effort less\nMerrick says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but do some bucks has the finding published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nAlready thought that the cerebellum is cruel than most people thought but these results were way more exciting and clear then I could have ever dreamt\nDoesn't box says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's just much farther noticed that I think that's why scientists the neurologist had been missing for a

people have when they're drunk they're lacking started rather editing of your thoughts\nOne scientist who's not surprised by the new studies results is Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia ... Rahman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared in fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts are better off talking to the parts of the brain upstairs that are involved in cognition means that served by them is involved in those process to use as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate it's smoothing out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task\nWhat we now understand is that what cerebellum does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its contribution but when it starts working he says the result may be a brain disorder there is\nIncreasing evidence from a variety of fields now that psychiatric diseases from autism spectrum schizophrenia depression\nReady trying to fix some of these problems using treatments that make the cerebellum itself work better Jon Hamilton NPR News [noise]\nIt's for forty five you're listening to all things considered on northwest public broadcasting on term cocaine and the big red chair on Thursday evening\nWhich here do you think was a pretty good one for music DJ's his trips stretch Armstrong and Bobby took our CEO of NPR podcast what's good\nI think that Nineteen eighty eight was a banner year for hip hop will tell you more about that next on all things considered [noise]\nNorthwest public broadcasting is a channel for ideas and stories that expand your horizons every day if you're a member thank you for your support listeners like you and businesses such as what people have Moscow and Hodge instructing hobby also support the resource of lifelong learning learn more at N.
