and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the search is on for the person or persons who spent at least ten suspicious packages to prominent Trump critics this week\nHere in Washington the attorney general has condemned the bomber and said he is determined to ensure justice is done in New York police and elected officials are briefing the media here's police commissioner James O'Neill\nI can say with certainty that we will identify interested person or people responsible for these acts\nOK NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts that seems like today catch us up on where the investigation stand\nThe FBI has confirmed it's investigating ten suspicious package and these are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump\nMay include former president Barack Obama former vice president Joe Biden\nFormer attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan former secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that actor in prominent Trump critic Robert De Niro had received one of the package at an address link to him and in New York\nAnother common denominator is that these are people that President Trump himself has called out\nNone of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation authorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded\nA air had the potential to explode them in your health are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for a review they're an FBI officials as part of that review was already under way they're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA\nFor insights into how these devices were made and the FBI is assistant director William Sweeney says the powder in at least some of these ... does not appear to pose a biological threat important clue they're\nA former official at the ATF the bureau of\nAlcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives was reviewed some images of these devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people in intimidate them and did that was that\nHappening for political or personal reasons all of that as a big focus of this investigation All right so if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect is at this briefing in New York investigators we're not talking about individual suspects here's what we do know\nInvestigators are focusing some resources on New York and some others in Florida\nFor a number of these packages had to return address in Florida\nSpecifically to the office of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz shelter is not actually linked to these packages she didn't send them\nBut whoever did made her part of the story and there's another reason why authorities are focused on Florida\nAt least some of these homemade pipe bombs may have been mailed from Florida\nBesides the FBI and the ATF postal service

is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish eight hundred US troops are headed to the U.S Mexico border the Trump Administration is sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this at the caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond have become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms\nWere going to dig into this with Wisconsin Republican\nToday senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you Mary Louise how're you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border which as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system an insurance partly because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there are there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system ... large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding\nIn Mexico as their so called caravan makes its way Norris Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] well I I I don't know if I'd call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the\nMulti year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is unaccompanied children and I was failing units set of eyes by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction at a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I toured a\nB northern ... countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I heard a new term I'd never heard before SRAs special interest aliens when we say that we're\nThat that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen and I'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican and Central American immigrants\nAnd we've been tracking that now truth boy it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds it was a poster weren't dealing with\nTens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty five times so I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I got I I Do not have\nAny specific evidence in this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some effect\nWith instigating this caravan might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats [noise] what caravans they liked the care of as a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support the Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change the law so we can and these incentives I mean let's face it some of them there's Lucian is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counter productive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from there to ask you the direct question that is on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energized Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this the curtain ... people are opposed to a prison and is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of my proudest river homeland security most of these\nLaws aren't under my major's diction\nWe've got another my Comey's jurisdiction because as soon as this year I was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree with that I could start handling this so I'm trying to go through this as a business person would a problem solver gather the information find the areas of agreement in our committee we you know we all agree on a secure the border that we have to have\nReasonable silence standards that are maintained we want enforce our laws and we don't separate families so try to go through a problem solving process very transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect of this and then maybe successful breeds success\nSenator thanks so much for your time everyday Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin\n[noise] many of the migrants now traveling north originated in Honduras and attorneys like that happen every year but this group is far larger than most and its feel competing narratives about how it was organized\nNPR's Carrie Kahn reports many of the migrants said they heard about it on TV and social media and jumped at the chance to flee the safety of numbers\nFree coffee and bread and out by local residents in southern Mexico and they've been walking for days they heard about the hundreds leaving Honduras via social media last week and grabbed a bus catching up with a caravan right before cross into Guatemala\nNot that bad I don't know if they need in God I mean\nWe've been waiting months to join up with a caravan leaving says Vasquez said she wanted to flee Honduras after her husband was exploded and killed by gang members she says there was no way she could pass smuggler thousands of dollars and when she got attacks on WhatsApp describing the size of this one it seemed the safest way to go\nTalking the migrants on the truck north you hear similar stories early in October flyers began circulating in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula\nThe march north would leave from the city's central bus station popular cable station age the age went live on the bus station showing hundreds already lining up\nBack to la Fuentes a former legislator and human rights activist who put the original posters up to the TV shots were the best publicity\nLaw going on all your\nI never never imagined so many people would joined the caravan and that it will grow into the thousands of one days the president of Honduras has accused one days of receiving funds from Venezuela other officials have said one day to using the migrants to score political points back home he denies all those claims\nSo do I get better or not I mean those are the owners are saying that you were better for that or is it I mean yeah\nYou just have to spend Fifteen minutes with these people and you know why they're fleeing he says ... is a spokesman for Honduras as main opposition party Labour Day saying that\nBehind the carols on our radical political interests are left and criminal interest is grotesque and absurd\nHe says it's easier

together all these different pieces that they've collected from these packages there either all center on their way to FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia and they're trying to really look at the details here trying to figure out what they can figure out including looking at the powder that was found in a package that was sent to CNN the New York office\nOr the eyes William Sweeney talked about that really today let's listen to what he said\nThe powder in those particular ... did not present a biological ... other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating it any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nYou know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details of what they found out so far you know they're characterizing these devices as quote suspected explosive devices\nOr else batted away any questions that possibly any of these you know explosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intense they're focused\nWell one big question is where these packages sent through the poster system or some of them could they have been delivered by carrier\nAnd also what were the materials you for these explosive devices I spoke with a former ATF agents and he said that really they're looking at trying to find signatures that may be able to identify who who's the individual individuals' behind this\nAnd also they're looking at a closed circuit TV footage to see if they have any indication of who may be involved and you really can't rule out that there may be more

couple of days ago with several panels about Halloween costumes and talks about how she's not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody but different race here's what she had to say\nIt's really you do get in trouble if you are white person who was on all the way in a black person a facade of why we like that that was okay\nTurn to the course of American history depiction of African Americans by whites\nHow did her fell NBC calling to react to all this\nPretty sharply a is a notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story or both by a on the NBC nightly news\nUh obviously it's anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks I and also on the today show in the hour proceeding her own show a tour for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from our broker he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShe owes a bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Teamsters minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin to perhaps the newest co hosted today show he weighed in as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line but this was political correctness run along that Philly in junior as soon as it is just as ignorant and racism statements itself\nAh NBC News Germany Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well this isn't the first time making Kelly and his criticism while at NBC um why do people think that's what's the last straw [noise]\nWell I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to our own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host of much sharper edge Fox News host she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ were white\n... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show is an ailing a it's a guide rather tempted 'em a ratings\nAre and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment against some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure\nWho retains his ties to the network what have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this a source would direct knowledge of the matter says it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet\nYou know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a cool and conflicted reaction and and I welcome from a employees that NBC as she displaced a couple of popular\nFor it in addition she was paid an extraordinary amount of money for a for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office that's\nNPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet begging Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they are definitely a big contributing factor that also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now that subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween now I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear around here we um we do every year old who was in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface I've been an advocate Halloween and Christmas at all companies on this one day of the year when all the races costuming comes out and maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether blackface is bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as\nWell walk us through some of the history of this when did we first started seeing blacks in America\nWe first start saying black face in the early Eighteen hundreds\nMay become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like black people by talking in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course these mental shows depicted black people with lazy as animal is to play caricatures caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad humidity and then allow slavery to happen at the time um and so these caricatures linger in the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ... and\nIt's the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black face [noise]\n\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow fever portrayals of Asian American pie and think of ... character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it does mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy set against that\nAnd to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nWhere the people who are caffeine caricatured often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people with mental shows who are not wearing black because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\nTo track us back to this week in her apology Megan\nClaim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden in ... when she was talking about this and this panel just all white and I went to the port and she's going to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface\nAnd that happens all the time and have conversations about race in history and power they always become conversations about intent and not about so that was brought up contacts they always start in a store a vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you've raised it or is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nSo I'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so many controversies tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party dressed in blackface usually there's not a black person independence and no one at that party any bad an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and then that video has to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery as well maybe these conversations\nWill be better served if we spent less time parsing out what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people are not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team ... thank you so much that we feel like like silver

turned around here in Michigan the rate was close to Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof there was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM shut it down and two thousand ten\nIt's odd standing here see most shuttle yeah\nI'm sure it is it's crazy what does the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear it today a
