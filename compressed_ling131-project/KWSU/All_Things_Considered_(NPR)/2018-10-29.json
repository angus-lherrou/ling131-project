so I've driven down to to see him um [noise] but I'd also brought a long time\nA gamble a little bit and then went to Portland hung out with him spent the night and I was back in the casino and I was hung over and ill in part because I was in a casino and just you know there are a little bit sad [noise]\nAnd small casinos in impoverished rural areas are a little bit extra set [noise]\nAnd those are concerned about my own gambling and my relationship to what I was doing at that\nMoment I used to play blackjack for a living I was a card counter um which is card counting as a a legitimate um\nMathematically valid method for winning at the casino game blackjack and I I used to do that for a living and then uh and then my life took an unexpected\nCourse since I Am sitting at the table is thinking about these things and suddenly the man next to me has dealt a hand he gets a twenty as his hand a but it's not an ordinary twenty it's made up of two cleans apart screen of hearts on top of another queen of hearts and as soon as I saw that hand hit the table I thought maybe\nUm everything's going to be All right\nNow I used to kind of courage for a living and I was taught to do that by a group of friends mentors or who are some extraordinary people very brilliant very poised prosperous and sort of beautiful in a way and they are incorporated me into a blackjack team that they had been operating for some time and taught me how to go into casinos and when my\nAnd my job was to go in and when a and take the money out of the casino which you take in cash you take it a new stuff it into

this small place where there were twenty five or thirty people all staring at me customers of the casino people who work there weren't going around and everybody there and knew exactly\nWhat I had just one and it seems at the cashier they knew I was getting paid in cash and so I moved briskly for the ...\nAnd a briskly across the parking lot and I started the engine of my car drove out made a

part of part of the whatever might happen with which card counting story specifically in a room has a lot to do with the nature of the stories themselves because people when they're hearing them are I

long been obvious to me that a card counter if you'd legally changes his name should change it to three or more first names [laughter] presents a piece of ID to a person that just you know he can claim that any one of the names is actually the first name\nAnd you know depending on how familiar the casino personalities with that particular form of id they're often you know they see ideas from

respond to their latches verbally in French ... so I couldn't turn down French ... and I was never shown the letters but only I knew a certainly from my mother died the reaction\nUh everything my mother did was interesting to me I I'm adored her like mostly what I adored about her that she adored me [noise]\nUh [noise]\nSo I liked to see her angry or it was interesting to me to see her angry and speaking in the language which I had no interest in learning at all um because in any case it wasn't a proper language was just a broken language also we were told\n[noise] um [noise]\nEven truly a well as I say I was very I adore dispersing uh eventually when I was around nine years of age I should say I'm a my mother became pregnant and\nI don't know how this happened [noise] um\nShe I did

uh to me that she gave birth to a bowling yellow ...\nHere's Sebastian on crafting a story\nYou know I Do a lot of public speaking and I'm used to sort of talking and explaining how things work [noise]\nAnd then I started to understand that that's not what the bosses\nYou're really doing is telling a story\nThat allow people\nTo understand something more deeply\nStory that you're a doctor here increased images of war and it's not too difficult for children I told him off and I called I with the stories from the front line here\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nI uh first went to war when I was thirty one I grew up in a wealthy suburb\nI spend my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables\nAnd I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man that I thought war would be a exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and said no books and pen and a few thousand dollars I went to\nBosnia during the civil war is are able to try to learn to be a war reporter and war was all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not this point but it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example that the first time I saw a dead body there wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people dying more civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil\nWar it was a girl like sixteen\nUm taken by surprise military forces are and they took her up to a field above a town goes to a record and they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat [noise]\nAnd what I saw her it was a couple of weeks later summer was hot\nAnd the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails and that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for [noise]\nUm [noise]\nI remember the first time I got ready to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out at the front lines that it was\nA goat getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to Freetown and I got an a jeep with a few ah Sierra Leone and soldiers who really were good for much and when and if not a couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown and these rebel ... stepped out of the jungle\nIn front of us but their guns leveled at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us [noise]\nAnd I tried to get ready I was hoping I was ...\nAnd I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope that doesn't hurt that's all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like that but I could see the little black hole that the boy\nComes out of you know one point a guy\n... his gun and started to shoot another guy grab the barrel and jerked it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us I thought it was attorney inside those holes and they're so small the thickness of a pencil\nAnd attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us and we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it\nYou go to war you think do you think you're going to be\nBrave [noise] have you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd [noise]\nSo this time I was out at a small American outposts that Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against them sandbags\nAnd some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd when you have to understand about bullets that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoots at you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters the first thing that happens is you you ask yourself am I getting shot at\nBecause the sound of bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives moment later\nYes I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy well the bullet the bullet a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face that's what I felt\nWhat the angle of deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right\nNow what's the mass on that angle you don't even want to think about it\nUm and then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed\nBullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking unit everything that was paralyzed those behind some sandbags our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bullet proof that\nWe're getting attacked from three died they're coming up into the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear just too much gunfire\nAnd I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there\nHe finally jumps across that gap any grab stuff he throws my camera to me it throws my bullet proof vest grabs his stuff is throwing a motor soldiers do the soldiers are pinned down to\nAnd it gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I start shooting I start working and then I'm fine I'm not scared any more [noise]\nTim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer an obviously very very brave a lot brighter than me um\nHe was also really kind of thoughtful about\n[noise] are free to love each other on reserve Italy without it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary\nAbout this little outpost we were going to call it Restrepo and we were going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot\nOn this rigid in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my Achilles on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of hail up So Tim took the next trip [noise]\nHe was on a on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up\nUp in the mountains on foot\nVery bad seen a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American physicians got overrun they dragged off a wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nI got him back but it was bad\nWay worse than anyone back home really knew you know\nAnd in the middle of all that same broke his leg he's at ten thousand feet up on the opposite guard with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long and the medical examiner foot and says well it's broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain by daughter were going to get hammered\nHere two Advil and Tim new Tim news day\nIf you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg

and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the defense department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nThat follows an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border posts as a national security threat here's air force general tyrants oceanography who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will ban CBP capability to harden the border\nSo there are something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border rate is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of does exist in two thousand\n[noise] uh just goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing and the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities and these additional\nFive thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role

border entry points in California Arizona and Texas\nCreating more card there are barriers more razor wire fencing crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agencies to more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so these soldiers will also built camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law firm called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties or they're only in a support role again I ended up plus we've come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used and former Confederate States in that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed [noise]\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms as far as which others would it be carrying arms or any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay a precedent for this child for sending five thousand active duty trips to the U.S Mexico border\nI don't recall the president for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past and again in a support role in this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful\nSo ... engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public or fears stuff in the journal or showed us he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the same number of troops now in Iraq right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brush that all aside

successful in recent years the evidence low inflation and extremely low unemployment\nBut the fed success has also undermined one of the basic theories that has relied on to understand the economy and how inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years the Phillips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heat it up\nBut these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low\nThat's got some people writing the obituary for ... if you put it in a murder mystery framework or who killed the Philips curve it was the fed the kids to sell ... some Federal Reserve Schumer from James Bullard the president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago\nAnd what was the murder weapon well Bullard says it was the feds long persistence focused on keeping inflation\nAnd in the last Twenty years and because of that we have lower inflation more stable inflation and so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation\nSo Bullard says the Philips curve isn't working but rumors of its death maybe exaggerated it certainly still invoked during the debates within the fed about whether to raise interest rates\nSome policymakers argue that with unemployment so low right now the fed should be raising interest rates are much more rapidly to head off inflation\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is taking a gradual approach here he is earlier this month in an interview on the PBS NewsHour\nSettling for all the fellas\nI wouldn't say that it might be arresting\nA little more central bank humor this time in apparent reference to a classic Monty Python sketch a man walks into a pet shop with what appears to be a dead parrot in a cage\nTo complain about what I thought she was offered to do this but if the city was thrilled with this was\nWhen I when I was\nJust rented\nThe Phillips curve could just be arresting but with the help of his sleeping pill and the form of slow wage growth says former fed economist and one\nTo two different ways in which low rate of unemployment returned French and spy increasing wages\nAnd wage growth in the U.S has been sluggish which is part of the reason inflation is staying low\nWhat is the Philips curve is dead or just resting its long slumber has been useful for the fed says on who's now a professor at Hamilton College\nThe U.S economy is extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy response thinks fed officials are fine with that situation\nIf you ask the fed do you want Rowan stable inflation or do you want really rapid inflation because that were confirmed your beliefs about how the economy works I have to believe that most of the people at the fed would pray gives me relevance table information\nEven
