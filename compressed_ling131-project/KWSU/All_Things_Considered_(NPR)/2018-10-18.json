scientists announced that they had found the oldest evidence of life and rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe and they think that the rocks might just be\nMerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nMost widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from the floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they'd been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like or lack of a better word that kind of look like ... in bars they're stretched out bridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab\nShe says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt at that point and it's all good pointing from the perspective on it means a lot on non\nShe said that life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take cold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils so far

be shortages certainly in more distant parts from the pool so\nPretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasuries made an estimate says what what's happening in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock it cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red type out the borders and that without to business costs\nIt would make it ... percent or less attractive place to invest because if you have less access to the European market the potential for terrorists as well\nSo the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hit ... an aircraft\nCrunchy releasing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person would be a poor taste and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if you can't leaves without a deal\nFor the rest of

but the point is is a symmetric shock waltz it's true that the other European countries with suffering as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from a deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more the lesson to be honest I I mean we all ... of the Y. yes I think why it will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides are not really as big as they are often presented by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister does the deal and Brussels sushi than have to sell it to have very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be positive and negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my basis I'm Still despite all the negative noises around as common sense

all things considered from NPR News\nWhen most people make a mistake they say I'm Sorry but what should accompany do when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apology Stacey Vanek Smith hosts the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar\nAbout why sang sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou know it was like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nThe study was partnered with over when we look we focus on the Ninety five percent of late night for the most extreme ... most late ride there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies and we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase of ...\nApologies and involved with the commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to the future it it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically two or three months later these commitments if you've been in the future actually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to the future and then the right if he didn't do better cars than maybe maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and I as a result the those people punished but more than than the control group that got no apology at all did they ever have a good effect I'm not in our data\nSo [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect ... or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet it seems like we don't want the same level of trust and accountability I think\nPart of it is that our brains sort of works on scripts interest sticks and so you know enter in a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and the risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what would be what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was that magic\nThe magic was money [laughter] [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um that we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones that put an increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there is no statistical difference between the different languages his mind it seemed to be just money and in fact the methods that she might may have backfired a bit with the message that sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think that's like carries over into personal relationships thing that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know here's a box of chocolates right or here's your editors and flour\nFlowers and candy take on a whole new significant um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize\n[laughter] people thought always wanted to ask you this question they do I'm curious I think the main way change that because all my friends and my family know that I study apologies than they would always ...

federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint had smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our our ground be found in the midst of all into the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nSo you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP\nTo admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges at talk crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my office says the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the mentored based upon that\nSubject to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was ... there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he had used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now here's a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to
