crafty crazy person from the minute I got engaged I became a best with the details of the wedding I thought it was an option\nPerfect case to\nCite dived into research I was looking up take sends photo booth backdrops and wedding dresses I was basically the reason interest with invented [noise] and after all my deep dives I was ready to go\nI started the invitation I hand embroider to every one of my wedding invitation [noise]\nAnd I mailed them in on the left with vintage stamp size picked out to match the personalities of every person that I invited [noise]\nSo my dad got up to lead to the military down then I just scour ... vintage WC Fields for a funny friend and\nI may have to instill outlook does leftover pure fantasy Presley but after those were sent off I started thinking about their section [noise]\nI don't like the smell of flowers they give me a headache so I decided to make all of our center pieces I Would create flowers from buttons from his family and my family I made my weddings okay like I created flowers for peace of my grandmother's wedding dress and my mom's letting down\nAnd she went along with all of this [laughter] he actually went with me to thrift stores picking out all the mixed matched vintage place if we would use for the reception and tracking down all the little talk first for the twelfth cake and we're going to have\nIs twelve I'm a big believer in cake so\nThere were about to mostly the music he actually wrote a song for me to walk down the aisle you can post it an orchestrated it and send it off to the band\nAnd we got prepared for our big day was going to be so beautiful [noise] like an anthropology catalog threw up over everything about [noise]\nAbout what I wanted [laughter]\nWe got married on April twenty four which was my grandparents wedding anniversary they had been married sixty four years when the day at my wedding and I thought by picking that day it would bring the same good luck and we were married outside\nSt Louis Missouri in a town called ... core which is his home town and his sister's back yard\nSo on April twenty fourth we hung outlived twinkling light in the tree decorative little stars\nPut out tables in my beautiful center pieces and on every seat laid down a custom made played that all I had done for the event now and all of this preparation he failed to mention that April in Missouri it's tornadoes\nThe shape of swan when the tornado siren went off\nAnd then came the rain\nAnd then hail and when and it knocked all of the table Dover an alumni beautiful center pieces into the mud six months of making them every night and they were destroyed no one saw any of it\nNow luckily I was marrying a circus clown [laughter]\nThe only time that's lucky by the way\nWe had invited all of these circuits people but we hadn't trapeze artists and jugglers and if there is anything they know how to do it is pitch a tent so [noise] I went to a big shop\nAnd we cleared out the branches and threw away all of the handmade bunting I had made got my grandparents out of the tornado shelter that they had been trapped in I'm ready to be getting\nThat it was supposed to be the ring bearer but she was not having it and she wouldn't get in the little cart I made so we just proceed without her [noise]\nUm [noise]\nI was looking forward to the song\nHadn't heard it and I realized oh they're not going to play\nBecause the bandleader had a heart attack [noise]\nFine um but they didn't feel comfortable playing it without him so instead I walked down the aisle to the theme song from the west wing [noise]\nFavorite show so [noise] um [noise]\nThe photographer had never shot a wedding before so she forgot to bring a flash 'em and some guy showed up and apparently brought a stomach virus that I had not registered for um\nSo throughout the day people kept getting sick and dropping like flies\nAmongst all of this the worst part for me\nWas that my dad decided not to come I didn't ask him to walk me down the aisle and so he said I'm not going to be there and I have a stepfather that I've had since I was seven years old and I didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself\nBut he didn't like it and so he chose not to come\nTo my mom called him I called them and he said well I spent a check\nI bet that's the same thing\nI'm is only daughter and he chose not to come to my wedding\nAnd that will always be\n[noise] so I I danced with his dad my grandfather and as we weighed beneath the big top [laughter] he looked at me and said your dad should have been here\nAnd he should've been [noise] and then\nMaybe you would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen [noise]\nAll of our hamburger spiders just went up in flames [noise] but\nHe also missed the double rainbow that came out after the storm is finally pass by I mean a star friends singing a song from ... to do and and also has to pay and jump around [noise]\nAnd so\nAfter all it wasn't the details that made the day I had thought it would be my custom made crossword puzzle policemen and specialty cocktail I have made [laughter] which is just jak and coke but [noise]\nAnd family that showed up for us\nAfter all that detailed don't make the day\nAnd they don't make the marriage either because I'm not married anymore and [noise] I don't think a perfectly sunny day and matching escort card would have changed that we shouldn't have gotten married\nThere's something even K can't fix [laughter]\nMaybe if I hadn't been caught up in all of the preparations I Would have realized that [noise] but there are no articles on interest on how to stay married and Martha Stewart doesn't really tell you what happened after the big day is over\nBut even though it began with a storm it didn't end with one\nWe were married increase corps which literally translates to broken heart [noise] and my dad says now [noise] [noise] well it looks like I didn't miss anything anyway\nBut he did she missed a part of my life and he also missed our friend\nI'm a meat loaf cover artist called pot roast\nSinging karaoke in the garage on all of our friends dance and the

W. P. B.\n[noise]\nYou're listening to them off radio hour from the Iraq I'm Jennifer ... next up our final story it's another from our show in Albuquerque with our\nPartners K. N. W. here's Tristan ... live in New Mexico\nIt's a bright spring morning in the middle of the back woods of Oregon and I am volunteering to cut trailer with my partner death he's just ahead of me on the past\nAnd just suddenly I Know that it's time for me to ask the question that's been building up between us for months now have this too and I have a baby\nSilent he turns around and I see that he is laughing at me\nIn his defense uh we had our hands while we were actually already parents a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while\nI'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of helium Riley had just becomes final they were ages five and seven and we were just trying to get that teased a freedom that come when you have big kids [noise]\nUh the second reason that he said no is because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby and I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth\nTo a baby [noise]\nUh this is in some kind of a feat of modern science or I'm just transgender ah for me that means that I was born female uh I was raised with a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nUm and as I got older um that's literal feeling a feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person and I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body and it was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem um and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it\nMeant that um I could stay alive a and I could transition and that could be happy um which is what I did\n\nI started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay man in Portland [noise]\nAnd it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine with just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and Ben is not trans he's just a normal gay dude he's not normally you special [noise]\nYou know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two\nMen we have everything we need to make our own baby [noise]\nAnd we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything who have given birth to happy beautiful children we knew it was possible a but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and that was really worried about my safety um navigating the world as a pregnant man\nHoped that it was going to be okay and I also am not going to take no for an answer [noise] um so eventually he did say yeah and I went to a doctor and everything was in working order I stopped my hormones hum and we started trying a\nAnd a few months went by nothing happened um and I started to think maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel peaceful about that I woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\nAnd I had read all the pregnancy books you know everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right time for me to get to be pregnant and so I refuse any that pregnancy test and then just made me and I took it and there were two lines and I was pregnant\nAnd it was going to be a baby you know but also super scared because you have to do a lot of things to get ready for baby like picking even buy diapers and learn how to take care of a baby [noise]\nHaley and why we have been toddlers when they came to live with us so I didn't know what to do with a baby and then my body started to change really quickly I'm\nAn all of those ah markers of femininity everything just got bigger everywhere and I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nBut it actually ended up being okay\nAnd I think it's because really early on in my transition and I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like ... my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I cannot do or\nI could get excited about the thing that I can do that their bodies can't which is to create life so that's what I did um I just leaned into that and then I just about everything else go\nA and wait around this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly\nUm and I don't know about you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person had been um something terrible has happened to us um and that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out of trans um because our lives our misery said of the media\nAnd I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes there is hardship in in being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and trans people of color but for all of us there's also\nAnd I and I hope the world was ready [noise] um\nAnd we didn't think it was a big deal for me to be a pregnant man everybody else did [noise]\nI don't know if they still say let go viral um but that is what happened to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone's don't read that\nUm [noise] CNN a Washington Post people magazine pregnant man and I thought maybe this is good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know [noise]\nAnd like trans kids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store\nAnd just say thank you for helping them understand that there's a little more than one way to be a man and and more than one way to be trained on um a lady once told me that she adopted her needs to and she thought it was marvelous that my body to give me the life I deserve while also bringing new life into the world but\nOutside of the Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready\nFor this story um I became really good friends with the ... and ... because I Would just get hundreds of messages on Facebook that was just that um people would tell me that I wasn't a man at all I'm just a really ugly cherry woman\nAnd that I was going to give birth to a monster\nAnd then one woman sent me a message that said at the Christian I Hope that you give birth to a dead baby [noise]\nBecause that baby will be better off than a baby that has to be born to someone like you\nI was six months pregnant when I read that message\nNow I have been transfer a long time Fifteen Years I'm actually at age thirty five I'm I Am past the point of average

Chang and I'm Audie Cornish Turkish president ... or the wand says he'll make a big reveal tomorrow he'll give a speech detailing what happened to Jim ... and the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second\nAnd all along turkey has accused Saudi Arabia of killing the journalists for Saturday's acknowledged it only Friday after denying it\nThe kingdom now to understand the aims of the Turkish government we're joined by Amanda slowed she's a senior foreign policy fellow at Brookings she just got back from Istanbul welcome to the program thank you so to give us some context there was a rift between these two countries right that predates this incident what's going on there [laughter]\nYeah absolutely some of the tension goes back to the Arab Spring of twenty ten when Turkish president then prime minister air to want assumed that like minded governments led by some of these Islamist parties\nWould come to power this fell apart for him in twenty Thirteen in Egypt when the Muslim Brotherhood elected leader Morsi who was an ally of turkey was overthrown in a coup by cc who was seen as a foe by turkey and backed by the Saudis\nSo essentially a turkey has uh some enemies in the region now right including Saudi Arabia so uh what are they trying to gain in exerting basically pressure on the Saudi Government\nI think there are certainly has always been a challenge in a struggle for a balance of power there in the region I think what we're seeing with air to one right now is particularly directed against Mohammed and saw him on a known as as NBS on friends right now absolutely absolutely of who king Solomon designated as the air and twenty Seventeen\nOr the one I think never has really trusted him I think he thought that the west was buying into his reformist image while he was engaging and crackdowns uh he's thirty three which means he's likely to be in power for a number of decades and I think everyone always saw him as being particularly\nUnfavorable to Turkish regional interests and so I think what we're likely to see from air to one in his speech tomorrow is continued efforts to try and impose maximum damage on NBS\nMeaning he wants them replaced a new era gold\nIdeally I think you would like NBS removed or at least weekend in terms of removing his de facto powers on on the foreign policy side\nSo is this speech directed really add to President Trump the U.S is that the the nation that could bring this pressure to bear\nA air to one certainly recognizes that turkey doesn't have the potential to do this on its own and so it really is going to be as you said the United states that is going to have to do this\nA little one has been quite quiet over the last week and a half and a lot of the information that we've seen coming out has been leaked from Turkish government sources and I think it's not an Turkey's interest to have a complete rift with the Saudis but I think this weekend when there was a very weak admission from the Saudis about what happened in as you noted some\nShowing that it was a premeditated murder by a professional teams who came to assemble a to providing a possibly in are the ones remarks tomorrow more evidence of a direct link of these operations to NBS himself which then it would put further pressure on Trump's in terms of his response\nUm e as we said you just got back from turkey what are you

chances NPR's Tovia Smith reports on the new effort to keep students safe\nOne of the first things colleges are doing is teaching students to recognizing opioid overdose\nAnd what to do leaving you

the middle of an epidemic affects everybody\nShortly after a student died of an overdose in two thousand sixteen police putting our canon every dorm in parking lot and trained more than a thousand people to administer it\nAll you do you feel this facts you can hold it like this put the tip into the patients Nasir all about\nThree quarters of an inch down into the nasal passages given once ray and then you're done that's and junior eyes they arose ... one of the resident advisors who've been trained yeah man I'm ready to and I think personally I feel like it's my moral obligation to help someone overdose could\nActually save another person's life students like Nick this anti say it's comforting not just for the small number of people who maybe heroin users but also everyone using other street drugs like cocaine which is sometimes lease with opioids like sentinel unbeknownst to users\nHonestly I started a lot of kids are where it was that when problems\nBut it's a really tricky situation\nThis student from a different university says he spent about ten years battling addiction he asked not to be identified do avoid harming future job prospects\nDuring his college years he says he overdosed twice and kept failing classes but he says that was before schools are set up to recognize or support students with drug addictions\nThey didn't want to acknowledge the problem like everything's fine at our school but I mean it was probably blatantly obvious on his way those it was pretty bad\nNow one and a half years sober he's back in a new school and works in a campus recovery center the likes of which barely existed even a few years ago his school is also just started giving free nor can to students but only if they ask for it he worries many users or their friends would be too afraid to do that\nBut he says he also sees the downside to just leaving it out for people to take anonymously\nThe cons to that is ... you have no way of offering them further help the only way that we can help them is if we know who it is\nAs colleges struggle to workout best practices some say parents can't afford to just stand by in weight\nUnfortunate we aren't colleges haven't really caught up and I think parents need to take it into their own hands\nJillian Bauer reached teaches at Temple University where two students died of overdoses last year she says when kids head off to college parents should send them with ... as well as fentanyl testing stripped\nJust like they would send them on with condom cheer encourage them to the first acts they can create like a fee for drug use can for them to you\nShe dismisses concerns that it may actually encourage more drug use\nLike I don't think that if you're a student with planning on studying for their exam that having had no testing strips in their drawer is gonna be calling their name to go out and buy drugs and tried\nBut others question such broad based strategies especially for schools with scarce resources even with school discounts and arcane runs about Seventy five dollars for two doses emergency kits contain to just in case\nAt Bridgewater State University none of the kids put out last year had been taken yet and in the two years since the University of Texas at Austin launched a similar initiative several kids play off campus have been successfully used the program director Lucas hill says all those aren't\nThat may not be cost effective and so we'll see maybe on campus\nIs not the hot spot hills now considering placing kits instead at convenience stores in bars\nBut he cautions not locks on alone is not the answer colleges also need to beef up treatment in recovery programs preventing overdose death he says is not the same thing as curing addiction Tovia Smith NPR

painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happened that begins to redefine what we can that our art you can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine I'll buy Marcel disarmed or he literally took 'em then you're in on hanging on a wall right\nAnd it's completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what aren't actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is um I went in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical contact\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you price a painting that is not the product of the human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and do you need ... to the piece of work those are the factors that drive the price an art so\nHow do you price art where those things don't really apply well they don't apply\nBut let's add to that led to add to that the market ability or a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or anywhere 'cause I really I tend to think that the whole thing is\nOrchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price that in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process for blowout\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it ends up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay\nAlgorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of the original artists ownership I Do believe it's split between the programming the code or the collective and maybe even a little bit of a nod to create these for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNow I don't
