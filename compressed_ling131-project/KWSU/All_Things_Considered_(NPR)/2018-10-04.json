I'm Ari Shapiro and I noticed a change in the weeks since Christine Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett\nKavanaugh sexual assault President Trump's response has been relatively restraint that changed completely last night and the president from mocked Ford at a rally in Mississippi\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place and I don't remember how many years and they in\nThe White House briefing room for a secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello\nSo as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey\nFord Motor testimony is very compelling and she looks like a very fine woman [noise] now he\nSeems to be sort of healing to the line that congressional Republicans seem to be healing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible you know maybe the ...\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really the verging from that line and he was playing it to last and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape and so that has people really upset today\nSome how the response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nRight well they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her vote now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote\nYou know one thing that has been swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct absolutely\nHe has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nAnd one of those allegations against Trump Jessica leads that woman who said he had groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quote that he said was she wouldn't be my first choice she likewise said that to a crowd the crowd likewise lasted shared\nAnd you know he was really he really seemed to be saying she's an attractive and that wouldn't have happened therefore\nSoap the important thing that we're trying to get out here though is that we have a pet or not only of how Trump reacts to sexual misconduct allegations\nBut how his supporters react\nAnd his supporters by and large seemed to have stuck with him through the allegations against him even if they find those allegations distasteful\nRight here on listener supported northwest public broadcasting\nSupport for NPR comes from the

S. held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to has children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and assist and after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials deny that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere's no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds would find any child in our care for any parent\nHa chess by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time da just said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nAnd it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are still young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children it anyway no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that that authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does it is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nDa chess does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer systems still do not communicate across these agencies\nAre there any children still haven't been reunited with their parents\n[noise] oh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to Central America\nAll right That's NPR's Joel Rose thanks very much Joel\nYou're walking [noise]\n\n\n\n\nIn November voters in Oregon will decide measure won all five it asked whether to keep the state's decades old sanctuary law from Oregon Public Broadcasting's Conrad Wilson has this preview\nOn paper Oregon sanctuary law is simple it does know law enforcement agency can use that money equipment or personnel for the purpose of detecting or apprehending people whose only violation is being in the country unlawfully but what that means is also confusing because it hasn't been interpreted by the courts\nWe would like to repeal the law so that state and local law enforcement officials can cooperate with immigration authorities in removing people here\nCynthia ... is the president of Oregonians for immigration reform she spoke during a debate last month I Hope you do you think out loud she wants Oregonians to vote yes on measure while five\nThe repeal of law would not turn state and local law enforcement official\nPacked with the police for whatever reason then if they are wanted by ice and they can cooperate with them in the removal from our state\nSupporters of Oregon sanctuary laws disagree they say if the laws repealed local law enforcement will be seen as an arm of federal immigration authorities Andrea Williams is the executive director of cows up an immigrant rights organization she wants people to vote no on measure one oh five\nTrust is the foundation of good policing and when local law enforcement act as an arm of federal immigration many people including immigrant families will become too fearful to report crimes that they've been victimized or share important information if they've been a witness to a crime\nDuring the measure what five debate Williams pointed out that Oregon sanctuary law allows police and sheriff's to verify the immigration status of someone arrested for something criminal added allows local law enforcement to request information from ice for criminal investigations\nWhat the law also protects against though is on Syria's civil rights violations to ensure that no one is singled out simply for how they look the color of their skin their accent or they're perceived immigration status\nOregon sanctuary bill passed the legislature almost unanimously it was signed into law on July seventh Nineteen eighty seven\nBoth Republicans and Democrats voted for Bill it was not it was really not controversial\nRocky Maria was the Democrat and state representative behind the law\nAnd to be honest this was not meant to be a century long it was meant to protect local city our resources\nAnd also to prohibit racial profiling Berea says before the law was passed local police and sheriff's wouldn't harassing target people in public based on their race\nIt was a pretext for racism I mean basically I'm just you know this measure the blacksmith Mexicans you know people of color\nNationwide the Trump Administration has advocated for a closer relationship between local law enforcement and immigration and Customs Enforcement at the same time leaders in sanctuary cities and states like Oregon have pushed back\nAn additional complicating factor is Oregonians for immigration reform itself the group advocating for yes on measure one oh five the Southern Poverty Law Center has called it a hate group Kendall and others who want to repeal the law and had been accused of advancing a false narrative with statements like this\nAre recycling criminal aliens putting them back on the street so that\nAt the same level or less than native born Americans if Oregon sanctuary law gets repealed it could become an even larger part of the Republican Party's agenda as for what repeal could meaning Oregon that's less clear\nCommunity with thanks very laws of their own would see little change but some kind of insurance would see it as an opportunity to work much closer with federal immigration agents I'm Talking about Wilson in Portland [noise]\nIt's five forty eight\nChina has long practiced censorship within its own borders now it's trying to censor educational centers overseas where freedom of speech is a fundamental right [noise] that stories next [noise]\nSupport for northwest public broadcasting comes from the ...

background check of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh late tonight or early tomorrow\nThen senators and some top aides will look at it but looking at it and may take some time only one copy of the report is being made available to the entire Senate\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell still insists the Senate will vote on the nomination this week joining us to talk about the latest as NPR's Scott Detrow joining us from Capitol Hill has gotten a there so the FBI had a full week to do this they haven't used that entire week does that give us any clues about the scope of the report\nWhat we've seen several clues that it's likely on the more limited side the FBI had a week to do this and as you mentioned they wrapped it up two days early we also know that the White House was directing the FBI and how broadly are narrowly it would focus that report and the White House was able to do that because it's in the background investigation not a criminal probe\nSo only one copy of this report will be made available to the entire Senate not one per senator and each party is going to have one hour to look at it what do you make of that I think they're mostly\nDoing it so people like me aren't able to find a copy a committee leadership wants to make sure this will leak so the report\nIs being held in the secure ruined the Senate uses for confidential information only senators and a half dozen or so staffers with security clearances will be allowed in no notes can come out and nobody's allowed to talk about it\nAnd this is really frustrating Democrats who say this is not a transparent process and that given how the public this is all bend the public should know the conclusions of the report\nWe know the FBI has not talk to at least one key witness Christine Blasey Ford her lawyer says she has not been contacted how do Democrats and Republicans feel about that well a lot of top\nRepublicans are just fine with that I asked to John Cornyn the number two Republican in the Senate about this as he got into an elevator earlier today\nAs we heard from ever since I was referring\nTo last week's public testimony of course a Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley has said something similar Democrats say that makes no sense that the whole point of following up was to confirm or despair\nBlumenthal leads are follows\nThe interviews creates additional questions

senators remain undecided have they said anything about the investigation and whether or not hearing from Kavanaugh or Ford again it looks like a problem to them\nYou know it's been hard to hear from Jeff Flake Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins about all of this because in a way that really underscores how key they are every time they step out of their offices there absolutely swarmed to the point\nWhere Susan Collins has been walking around the capital with police protection which is incredibly rare and just shows\nHow how much she's in demand they have all said that they wanted a broader report Jeff Flake said that he wanted to report that answered questions that didn't just check a box so I think their reactions tomorrow when they have they're turning to secure room really

I told him that would make him cry some when they did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect and the and he would feel like he failed\nIt is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well\n[noise] I did get responses from people concerned\nGore he has a lot of when and said I told my mother and learned that she had been a victim to\nOr I told my mother because I thought she would

hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response please\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions I shared your call in with my wife of forty years and asked her had this ever happened to her\nAnd she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled\nI asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready I didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think I Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi\nWell so I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dad they're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who stay I always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you on murder them and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send because what if the\nSo I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time and good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also that it's important for daughters to tell their fathers about this so that they have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dad for the first time because of what we're hearing and that they have enough for hearing because their fathers have said something like\nI'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago and I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you\nSo if you were a father and you have some sense of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who has said\nI grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is why\nMonica has to use the Washington Post columnist and her new novel out this week is called the war outside thanks so much for
