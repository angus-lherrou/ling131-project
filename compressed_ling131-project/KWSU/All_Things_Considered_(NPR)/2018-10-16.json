killed during an ... that went wrong in other words that the Saudis might be willing to admit that he was killed a CNN citing to unnamed sources do we know anymore\nI I've heard the report certainly but I cannot confirm them at this time\nOkay so that's something to keep an eye on it to the question of of the U.S in Saudi Arabia and the relationship and whether President Trump has opened the door for Saturday to try to we go out in some way I mean this is very awkward with two countries that are very strong allies\nRight here I Am name it's a very strong relationship between the two countries they cooperate on things like counterterrorism enter the U.S political element to this as well certainly Trump has been leaning on Saudi Arabia to keep gas prices low particularly ahead of the mid term elections\nAnd there's a multibillion dollar arms sale on the table as well which goes back to you know creating jobs here in America so they may look at things like whatever happened with not

had been trailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve at that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know

in his mid term very briefly has quieted all of the ... ... no not at all I mean I can tell you real quick the Republican National committee said that the test revealed only a miniscule percentage of

Mary Louise I'm real killers which was quite the turn of phrase do we know the president has thought deeply on those to come up with it on the fly\nWas the president is offering an alternative theory of the case although he didn't explain how a group of road killers could have gotten into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and killed someone\nBut his instinct is to deflect blame from the Saudi royal family he said several times today that the Saudi king flatly firmly denied it\nIsn't very similar to what he did with Latimer pollutant when he cited pollutants strong denials of any interference and the twenty sixteen election and back then he also offered an alternative theory of the case where he said someone weighing four hundred pounds sitting on his bed could have been the hacker of the Democratic party emails\nSo clearly the president's instinct is to defend dictators\nSo real killers as maybe the update on the four hundred pound guy we have to be okay and I mentioned the president was on his way to Florida Today I it's very common of course for president to visit a disaster area but in Florida a few weeks before an election what are the politics of a presidential visit\nThis was an official doesn't but it definitely had a political component because two of the most important races this cycle or in Florida the governor's race of course very important to Trump that a Republican remain governor there for twenty twenty for Trump's own reelection\nAnd also the current governor Rick Scott is the Republican nominee for Senate and if Democrats can't keep the Senate seat in Florida they probably have no chance of taking over the majority there\nBut the president did meet with Governor Rick Scott he praised him normally natural disasters are a very positive political opportunity for incumbent governors because they have the resources and executive powers that non incumbents lack they can be\nIn the Florida Senate race this is the red algae bloom the spin following the state's be choose and which is tied to warmer water to come with climate change and the warm waters which are of course also tied to the increasing intensity of hurricanes like hurricane Michael how is the president talking about that has Rick Scott talking\nAbout well what's so interesting about that is the president gave an interview to sixty minutes last night in which he said he thought the climate was changing but he wouldn't say that people are human activity was behind that change she even said well the climate is changing it could change back\nAh and then when asked well Ninety

ago ... helped conduct an audit about women's prison in Illinois and found that women prisoners were disciplined almost twice as often as men for all offenses big and small but almost five times more likely to get in trouble for a lesser offense called minor insulin\nAnd they also really if they seen injustice with another woman in a prison or something that happened they want to fix it like they want to be the mom that's going to come in and mediate between people and fix the problem\n... told us she likes it that women prisoners are this way but she said many corrections officers and often even in a women's prison most of them are men say they hate it\nThe first thing that they'll tell you is these women are so difficult gosh they're a pain I Would rather work anywhere but here they always want to talk to you they won't take no for an answer\nCorrections officers are trained to keep control they expect women to be compliant if the women pushback mass where those disciplinary tickets for influence come in to women we met in Illinois told us they'd been written up some years ago for an infraction code reckless I bowling\nWhile women get more tickets than men certain women get the most tickets of all women with mental illness those were a lesbian bisexual or transgender African American women especially for those lesser non violent offenses\n... ... a guard out that they passed on that to me that I write or yeah stuff like that\nWilliams was Nineteen when she went to prison in Illinois after repeatedly missing her court ordered nine pm curfew at our foster care\nStop at her sentence was doubled from two years before\nBut most of her tickets were for cursing and talking back to officers and those kept her in prison for extra days and she lost privileges\nOne time she says she got in trouble for cursing at a guard when her soul mate who had diabetes passed out Williams felt the officer was too slow to help Williams says the hardest thing was when she lost her phone privileges and she couldn't call her son he was a baby when she went to prison and he was growing up without her\nIt was bad because I missed out here I Am\nI'm referring to the polling\nHe's nine now but Titanic Williams says that time separated often not even able to talk to him on the phone makes it hard to be a parent now\nEven the consequences are are missing out on a year ago and it's hard right now are there are no other than on my blog on our family our current bickering have gone\nMore than half of women in prison or the mothers of children under the age of Eighteen one common punishment up that Illinois prison was that women last good conduct credits in one year alone twenty Fifteen women most Ninety three years of those credits that's twenty extra days of prison time for each woman\nThat's an average many women had no days added but some ended up with months even a year or more of extra time [noise] it's a small number of states including Illinois or trying to change\nTheir prime what's called gender response of corrections practices it's built around the idea that women are in prison for different reasons than men that they respond differently in prison and that prison rules need to recognize those differences in the last ...\nFound out\nThat prison in Illinois a trainer at the front of a classroom tells corrections officers to think through the different pressures in a woman's life\nShe needs to see what's going on with their Spanish she asked\nMe how to deal with this with\nPhone privileges revoked all she can do is write a letter home or to her son's school it's a reminder to the corrections officers that tickets even once for a lesser offenses can have significant consequences reporter Jessica public back meant officers that that training\nCo workers are much more skeptical\nI was hired a lot of things but\nTheir worst Bush wasn't gonna work that\nHas a thug that's a derogatory way of saying to letting the inmates run the prison we wrote letters to some of the women up at Illinois prison one woman who wrote back said that since the training started she's not seen much difference she said corrections officers both men and women are disrespectful and cruel\nAnd this was a quote there on a power trip cause bitches hose they tried to provoke you if you say anything back they send you the segregation per threats and intimidation\nThe number of women in prison is rising but still they're only about seven percent of the prison population nationwide so it's hard to get a prison officials to make

are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican\nAre states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone American society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continued to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an ... woman being a first

officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got some wonderful fellow than and turned on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I said don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come and so in the little time\nUm but it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan paved the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world look like Thirty years ago for someone that's my age um\n[laughter] I I mean it it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable\nBut as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks at my age\nYou know this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long\nProcess the Trump Administration has rolled back algae to Q. writes in some areas vice

send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community stepped up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially trans women of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae beauty keep candidates as well Gina\nYeah I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington and taxes that did not think\nA lesbian that could do how could do what we've done\nA but it goes back to exactly what a million discussed which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that can I ask ever ask anybody what party they were when they do\nIt at the end of the day I think it's less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nSo one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can\nAllies oftentimes and the impact we're having an young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and a meal you do as well to those young people that are following behind us [noise] I Want to thank all three\nOf you for joining us today Dan ... is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and Amelia Marquez is running for state legislature in Montana great talking with all of you get a pleasure to speak with all of us [noise]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News ... has received proposals for an initial public offering from various Wall Street banks all of whom are vying to underwrite the ride sharing company's ideal but what banks actually do when companies go public and why those banks are competing for the business\nThat story plus all today's business news is coming up next on marketplace on northwest public broadcasting I'm Tom cocaine glad to have you along on this Tuesday Afternoon for western Washington dry weather will continue to early next week then it will cloud up with a chance of precipitation\nBut at least of the cascades through the week and into the weekend mainly clear skies light wins with chilly morning temperatures and mild afternoons\n\nEvery year in northwest public broadcasting receives a state gets from listeners who included the station or there will trust if you have made the station part of your legacy your generosity will provide the community with public radio programs well past your lifetime\n\nWhat I might do at home I shouldn't expect any direct consequences in my relationship with Washington\nIs the Trump administration's America First strategy giving a green light to autocratic countries like Saudi Arabia Tuesday October sixteens and this is all things considered\nAnd I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly months ago journalists Jamal ... express concerns about Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... if you think you can do it alone\nAnd who doesn't really any coats that opinion or unable to share those changes told you have you been with him this hour we'll profile the prince believed to be connected to the show ... death also the latest from our investigation into the treatment of women in prison\nHe had to be careful of everything is so like everything was [noise]\nIt just meant to be punished handle later the painter behind us striking work of art hanging in the White House NOW News\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm ...

remarks we called up tomorrow Kaufman with us she served at the state department under President Obama and is now with Brookings she says Trump is following through on a position he took more than a year ago\nOn his first foreign trip when he went to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia he said explicitly we're not here to lecture we're not here to tell other people how to live what to do to to be or how to worship\nAnd that statement sets aside decades' worth of bipartisan American commitment as well as the commitment of a range of western democracies to international human rights law\nBeyond Saudi Arabia did you see a link between President Trump's\nHe's I think if I were a dictator especially one with a decent relationship with Washington a cooperative partnership with Washington\nAnd I heard the American president say that he's not here to lecture me I Would certainly take that as an understanding that no matter what I might do at home I shouldn't expect\nAny direct consequences in my relationship with Washington\nIf you take for example Philippine president ...\nUh who has picked up President Trump's phrase allergy about fake news and it's also engaged in a raft of extrajudicial killings of political opponents as well as of drug dealers\nThere's a lot of reason to be concerned that when President Trump goes on TV and is asked about a ... attempted murder of journalists and says well we kill people to\nThat that's going to lead someone like president to ... to think that he can get away with doing the same thing\nThere were lots of instances during the Obama administration where the president condemn the actions of foreign leaders whether that was ... in Russia or Bashar will also in Syria and it didn't do much to deter them so is it really possible to say that this was happening more because President Trump is in office\nI think they're both direct and indirect ways in which President Trump's\nBlonde attitude about human rights and democracy it translates into\nBehavior abroad the first of course is if dictators feel like they have a green light from the American president and that's pretty rare but the United states doesn't always criticized directly or one on one sometimes it works together with other western governments\nAnd they all do a day marsh together or the issue simultaneous statements so that no one government gets the backlash all by itself\nAnd when the Trump Administration takes the United states out of that coalition it deters other western governments from speaking up as well\nOh so you're saying it's not just that the U.S is giving an implicit green light to these dictators but it's undermining the international alliances that used to speak with one strong voice against the actions of those

punished for Lester violations of prisoner rules\nNPR's investigative team has been digging into this disparity this week today NPR's Joseph Shapiro takes us to a state that is rewriting the rules for discipline and women's prisons here's the sound we associate with prison\nCorrectional institution for women but once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it there are no more heavy steel doors for the women that's not a family here because this prison is new and it's different inside the razor wire\nThis place cooks kind of like the college campus with red brick building their new just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from John in Helmand asks depending on what level there and that's the warning show Tom showing us around and see what we do that and the community of right now are her outside and our yard within reason I guess it's still a\nPrison the Warren is the first the point that out and prisons are still harsh places\nIn some ways women's prisons are specially harsh because across the country women get disappointed that higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rules they're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch with NPR Emmett Till school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infraction can have big consequences\nWomen get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges that matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today it could get ticket about wearing their sweat shirt inside out and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had to ... I have one\nThat's the word and shovel dom in two thousand six teams aren't data found women at this prison compared to ... other Iowa prisons or three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive\nNow Don tells her corrections officers to give out fewer tickets like for breaking the rules about a prisoner can alter their uniform it was written for men's prison were assured inside out or squeezed rolled up might signal a gang affiliation\nDoesn't think gang related it's just women want to have some control over\nIt's a practice called gender response of
