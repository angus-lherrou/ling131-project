in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about like maybe three maybe four eighty five at

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created that healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this ... hey alright what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit who voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a higher rate that's actually a good sign economically\nThe point of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people\nThis is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have\nBut it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings than others\nYou know it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at the health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels\nAnd then there's this category called professional and business services that are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising in all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this is been puzzling economists for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that there are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there are more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but there are also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy's more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth has been kind of sluggish\nIn the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive because if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set a it makes them better at their jobs\nAnd it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nThat's of course the co host of our economic podcast the

things considered\nWhen they talk today I understand you've seen the report can you give us your reaction\n[noise] well I was really frustrated and disappointed by the report that we were given a clearly the FBI was told to very narrow the scope of people that they talk to\nI Can't tell you what is in the report but I can tell you that a credible number of people that both I'm Dr Ford and Mr ... gave to the FBI or that could corroborate their stories were not interviewed\nYou say you said the affair was clearly told to narrow the report the White House and Republicans in the Senate have said the FBI was given no restrictions\nWhen I Know from the FBI that they are when they are told debate and allowed to be very thorough following leads wherever they are to take them to conclusions and from what I saw today in the narrow scope that they've given um that that could not have been accomplished particularly because we know\nThat the names of people that both ... and Dr Ford gave them were not followed up nor were a number of tips that came into the FBI\nSo Republicans have said today that there is nothing in the report corroborating the allegation of getting a gal allegations against Kavanaugh sounds as though you're saying true but only because they didn't look for them\nWell I mean that's part of it in\nTim of sexual assault that they often do not tell anybody in the room I've talked to so many people say it is absolutely no surprise that Dr Ford didn't tell anybody at the time in fact she told us that\nHow traumatized she wasn't it wasn't really until years later ah where she told a therapist or her husband talked about it I've had so many women tell me their stories in the airport in a grocery store over the last week or so\nThat that's exactly what happened

national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson was at the Justice Department today she is most states and she is back here in the studio now with details you carry Hi Mary Louise okay so tell me more about the Russian intelligence officers being charged and why now it's tightening\nYeah the defendants are that in current Russian military officers today's charges include conspiracy and money laundering a few of the defendants are also charged with wire fraud or identity theft\nCourt papers face some of the cyber activity here started in twenty fourteen when allegations about Russia cheating to avoid drug test for the Olympics first came to light\nBut some of the behavior extended up till this summer ...\nThese hackers got their hands on now I gather all of these seven Russian officers are in Russia and there is no us ... extradition treaty employees so why bother charging them well FBI officials point out sometimes they get lucky these guys traveled the European\nCountries where there are ... extradition treaty is in place but even if that doesn't happen that the OJ facets practice of naming and shaming does make a difference because it shows the hackers America knows how to find them and describe what they did and sometimes other parts of the government imposed sanctions on individual hackers or the people who fund them\nThe assistant attorney general for national

decades or one of the two reporters who broke that Weinstein story was Jodi Kantor and she joins me now\nWhat you were up to a year ago today and it it's a bunch of you all crowded around to the
