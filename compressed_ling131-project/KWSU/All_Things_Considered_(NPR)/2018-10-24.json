adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honest and one of the best picture that we've seen in the national league they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what did they have going into this\nThey want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even

were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families\nBut it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children doing Cathy\nYeah that's the question right you know obviously they should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification so\nI think one of the reasons is because the government supported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in captivity\nThey're being held in governor facilities all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are I Would say over two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't want the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life is over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring our child back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow somebody whose parents to return to the U.S and reunite fee for right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents that you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kind of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law they would not be reunited into those people we've always said would not be reunited\nThe conduct DUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we are talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe Internet has reported that five children have parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has new idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we are not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal

especially in minority communities\nShe's the head of then why use Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAlright so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states\nBeing stretched photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of ideas in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near that are around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of in reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting perch from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn his role some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has and voted into into recycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as the administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late\nUm critically were also saying that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that their election processes we're not going to be discriminatory and we're saying that those areas are having an even higher increasing the number of people that are being perch from the rolls [noise] um\nEven climbing voter suppression um do the courts agree with so many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest laws have been a blunted by course overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet I I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that\nWas a enacted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota\nBut they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form a many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed or very very resilient and very determined to overcome it\nBut having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place [noise]\nYou know ... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project thank you for speaking with all things

congresswoman Maxine Waters US Capitol police say that they intercepted a suspicious package that was addressed to her\nThey say it was removed and is being investigated by the FBI right now we don't

NPR News I'm Ailsa Chang\nWe're going to go now to a region of the country that's been labeled tragically the suicide belt\nSuicide rates are high across rural America in and you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said the news someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rate NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of a valley ringed by tall mountains desert mazes and red rock lifts you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix it because it's nature but the surrounding now and I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life inside in Grand junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hurt a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together at another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley [noise] we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide would stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know pick up a buyer bootstraps mentality and\nKathy evil who's worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nIt's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small\nSo the issue of access to guns and I'm not ... I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have in our home 'cause my boys hunt but I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen school district was forced to act the old way wasn't working\nVictoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialized victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts news sources of strength suicide prevention program\nAs she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble or these are not junior psychologist but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicide\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year\nWhat are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health and starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier\nIn classrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\nAt fortune ... middle school eighth grader ... in the lunchroom taping note cards to ...\nI

that like have a lot easier and if it helps other people hope I don't mind sharing what's\nGoing on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people in the front lines sound confident that this is going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is Carissa school she had two daughters in a high school here six years ago she lost her husband who suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who had been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSchools husband grew up here was captain of its high school's football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer he was the community leaders seen as a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\n... says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess that's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men likes tools husband or lily leaves dad and uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Morris has the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well you have an uber powerful voice they have the most powerful voice
