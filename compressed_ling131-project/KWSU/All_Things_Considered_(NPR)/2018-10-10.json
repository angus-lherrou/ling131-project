guess the hurricane mornings didn't uh didn't interrupt the proceedings down there\nWere\nSome let me ask you what was your pitch to students last night how do you get young people to come out to vote what do you say\nWell first of all you have to wonder if you have to be concerned about more than ...\nWith all athletes that you were talking to\nYou know they were after we are I think it's important for Applebee's you they're far from where you put more\nFor a drink a lot of the time the state and local elections that are sometimes even more important than your presidential elections because those are the elections that are really affect your day to day life\nWell I Hope everybody staying safe down there\nNow you have been active across a bunch of friends those the op ed that that you co wrote over the summer along with several other pro football players or this was urging President Trump to use this clemency power to try to make a dent in the federal\nPrison population which leads me to ask them fairly basic question that the two things like getting out the right to vote or presidential pardon power pass to do with football I mean why do we need to hear from from the NFL on these issues\nWell I I don't think it's so much of hearing from an effort but I Do think you'd want to hear from lawyers who aren't everyday citizens just because we're at believes doesn't mean that we are not affected by the laws of the land doesn't mean that our family members are affected by what's going on\nThere been a number of very high profile other athlete activists also citing social injustice but doing it in a different way from you I'm thinking I was calling kept Bernanke thinking of Eric read both of them have made a point not to join the players coalition it are you in

particularly great phone line in Florida but I think people can hear enough of what you're saying well carry on 'em when that let me ask you why why are you pursuing it sounds like similar agendas fighting for social justice but not doing it together\nWell I think you know sometimes there's different ideas of how to go about making sure what I Will say that no matter how you to go about it I think all of the working poor that they're doing is important to work there were doing as a coalition is important [noise] um and we're all working towards the same car\nWhat changes do you want to see inside the NFL\nWhat I Want to have you on the\n... the people's hearts change towards these issues there's a lot of people tried to deny what's really going on and I thought and I think our way everybody was the thing is when you see that there is a group of people in our country that's not treated fairly and\nI Would be for everybody feeder for everybody to work together and come up with solutions to try to work\nDo you support the rate of current players to take a knee during the ...\nOut of the approach or if you have to go to work on a national anthem brings attention but then after you bring countries for issues you have to go out and address the issue of work to try to reconcile\nThat and ... and retired wide receiver and cofounder of the players coalition we reached him

calls to have coming in right now\nLeading up to this storm they were mostly people looking to um get a bit of a status of things I think the nature of the calls now have turned it mostly to power outages and that sort of thing\nWhich I guess in the grand scheme of things would be good news if people are worried about power outages it's it's so far you're not getting calls from people who need to be rescued from dire situations\nThat's correct or however as we expect significant damage from\nDowned trees that constitutes a threat now community known for its canopy roads large pines in ... we have not responded to that risk\nYet however I should note that our emergency crews in our public works crews themselves are sheltering from the storm at this time\nHow much damage are you seeing

business is always um life safety so clearing roads will be our our foreign first responders the will of course the first priority for us\nAnd what most people in Leon county doing we do have any numbers in terms of how many have evacuated versus how many of you hunker down and boarded up their windows and the writing this out\nWell I think a large portion of our population did decide to

second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him Fifteen Saudi sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that faded Fifteen people is a lot to to kill and individual in a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said it actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still\nDon't know but what we are understanding\nIs that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture a show not clear whether they wanted to capture and prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way\nOkay let's let's unravel that a little bit this to U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what Saudi officials discussing because she'll be corrected\nAs us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to ... to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably ... felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening stumble could be sort of a plan B\nOr for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or are met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these ...
