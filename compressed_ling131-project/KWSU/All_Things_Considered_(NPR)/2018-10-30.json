locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so these soldiers were also built camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all week oh there's a law called pasta come attached to switch per head that military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this this this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties ah there were only in a support role again and plus we've come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen Seventy and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used and former Confederate States and that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or of any others we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay precedent for this job for sending five thousand active duty trips to the U.S Mexico border\nUh I don't recall the president for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past in getting into a support role in this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who are doing everything again from constructing camps flying border patrol agents\nSoviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public affairs staff and uh again gentlemen showed us he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the same number of troops now in Iraq and maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said a border security is national security\n[noise] All

Washington bridge into custody with rain likely tonight each of the cascades chance of evening rain than rain overnight\nNPR News this is all things considered ... Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week's ago before the midterm elections President Trump is floating a new tactic in his immigration crackdown the president says he wants to end the automatic right\nConstitution in an interview with ... CEOs Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but\nNow they're saying I can do and just with an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose Hi Joel hey our first just fact check forests can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually to Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here's what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and that children who were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tell us what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order\nMost legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently has exceeded on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House his critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections I is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWhile the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at a campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nThat is in response to the migrants caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico\nHe wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term elections um although you know judging by the outrage from Democrats and others over his proposal to end birthright citizenship I guess it's possible that this issue will motivate voters on the other side as well\nOne more statement from the president almost that I'd like you to fact check Trump's has the U.S has out of step with the rest of the world and that it is the only country to all our birthright citizenship is that true\nNo that's not true the U.S is unusual but it is not unique there are over thirty countries that are also have birthright citizenship mostly they are in the western hemisphere including Canada Mexico Brazil Argentina but

Shapiro black women vote in large numbers and they overwhelmingly voted for Democrats Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and help to eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get him to keep black women energized\nWe recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates and more than a hundred of these living our meetings were happening that night across the country and\nThe women around the circle and here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers\nAnd healthcare analysts are sipping wind munching on tacos and commiserate about politics they actually did not know each other very well once they got settled then they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hat that followed the presidential election\nThink that the threat by the women's march and a half [laughter]\nThis is Michelle nearly she works in communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism posed twenty sixteen too little too late in ... opinion now in twenty eight teams it's time for the midterm Kesha ... believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates I think our boat\nHas been taken for granted um I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um everything that happened\nA lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focused on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly is underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters what is it\nYou can see he's ... he's being away from family we show what is\n\nWhat is the\nWife of white\nAnd that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Rebekah Brooks brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice every election\nCycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and that's why when we had a choice we had a stronger voice\nWould actually be an urgent issue and that's what it actually\nMissing urgency there's nothing else can\nI ask your Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well like I\nGet a relationship with them because I was in the legal and the other police officers based on in life all he fits the profile\nMy dad used to my brother's six three there are all star game we use a little bit\nLike every day in the pros\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything Rebekah Brooks resented the implication editor zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like it all your resources and all your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara ... right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuse says she's heard over the years\nThink about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this boat or block more seriously\nI think in this moment ah we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd so black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we've seen brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion and right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats\nWho have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as a relief to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republican they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and um that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with a on a Presley in Boston who did not get to\nThe CBC pack so when you look at the fire while they're at several organizations that are not a CBC or directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions about who to back and not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country this is a new
