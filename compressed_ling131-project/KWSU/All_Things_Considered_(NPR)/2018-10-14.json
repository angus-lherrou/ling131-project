yeah and\nAnd I have to say that line in his speech it was not improvised that was written down\nThis is very intentional right this is coming from them and it's it's kind of a strategy I was talking to Frank Luntz\nWho is a well known Republican pollster and he said that he has advised Republican to use this language he said because he feels like it's an accurate description of the protesters at the Kavanaugh hearings and up the way that they were behaving\nAnd Kelsey Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is also using this language and particularly upset about those protests um and you know people following senators in the hallway to to try to make their point in the lead up to the the cabinet vote\nYeah that's absolutely right and he's been talking about a lot the past couple of days\nThey all consuming animosity toward this nomination\nIndependent of all the Fox at all the evidence building stoked before the law is not letting up\nAnd it's something that he and I talked about when I sat down with him in his office\nYou've called Democrats and anger and all of the country you have to use her mob\nDeclared the mall but angry mob is not what I said about our Democrat colleagues\nI Do try to encourage or what what all the Congress where you were saying all while we were literally on her assault ourselves a trail and members to their homes getting in their faces or a capital\nM ever to clearly try to intimidate ocean\nHe said that he feels like senators were under assault\nAnd he made the distinction and I will follow it up and I said well Republicans have their own experience with a very excited base and I referred back to the Tea Party and their involvement back in twenty ten\nAnd he said it's just different\nIt's not something that you know just the Democrats and what does that say about\nMark what are the issues at play mining\nIs a big issue up in the eighth district the third party candidate is talking about opposing the mind he says that

major themes we're seeing that\nI Need you to just your friends your family your homework and you did vote Republican\nThere are less than four weeks until election day and polls show voter enthusiasm is hot but history as a guide most Americans won't vote in the mid term [noise] even when they're eligible one of the reasons why I haven't but it is because I feel that I'm always busy\nBeing away from home I don't feel connected to the political system I don't believe that it actually affect us\nToday we're going to look at who isn't voting why they are and what would happen if they did to talk about all of this I'm joined by NPR to medical ... and off my college hey guys hey there hey it is likely a lot of people won't but it is very likely\nA majority well not right and that's the whole thing is between presidential elections in mid term elections you have about a thirty percent drop off\nA between those two elections and that's why you hear the parties talking so much about cut a base politics things that really rough up their basis because they need to get the most active it's people out to the polls because this whole other group of folks just don't go out to vote\nBut I'll smoke why aren't they voting the it's complicated right like some of it because they're apathetic they're too busy they don't feel like their vote matters if you like the system is reg\nSo is there are some people who actually just obstructed from voting like they want to vote but they have registration problems or their name is kicked off the voting rolls but I Would say for a lot of people it does come down to both a combination of\nNot feeling like their vote matters but also not really caring too much about the fact that they feel like they have the power to change anything\nEvery mid term we see the same pattern emerged and that's what I'm Wondering are I think we have a pretty good sense of who these people are wonder if you can lay it out\nFor the audience sure sure I mean still the one big group I feel like we constantly hear pundits talk about our our young people and um you know this has sort of historically been a problem it even an issue when you look at presidential election years and I spent some time in a congressional district a right around the Las Vegas strip\nAnd why it went there in particular was they had one of the worst estimated voter turnout rate for young people in the entire country and twenty fourteen\nAnd it's an Eighteen to twenty five to twenty nine year old is how they oh wow that's not even that young and there was a young guy I met his name is ... he is attending a local community college there in Las Vegas\nAnd and you know he basically was very confused with the system he initially didn't know if you needed to register every year he thinks he registered but overall he just seemed confused with how you vote\nI've never voted before more from what all I Know about voting is on your show to the whole place and he's over I don't know what I Need to bring on an even know what happens during their\nBring yourself some states bring ID yes I mean there there is the argument that you know some of this you can figure out now increasingly through like Google but I Do think him like he was the only person who expressed this confusion with how you vote\nWhich I think it's interesting like people don't know if they're registered they don't know if they should register and maybe to us political junkies this is\nSort of things that we assume people know but I was really amazed by the amount of people who just did not seem to have that kind of like literacy Eighteen to twenty\nNine year olds are the lowest age group for voter participation every year consistently like these voters keep getting older and they wind up voting later on but\nAs young voters Eighteen to twenty nine they have the lowest participation rates and they have among the deepest drop off between presidential elections and mid term election and twenty twelve for example about one in five voters were Eighteen to twenty nine year old Nineteen percent\nThat dropped off to Thirteen percent twenty fourteen them back up to Nineteen percent during the presidential election in twenty sixteen\nWhy is that [noise] I feel like I've heard a couple of big theories one being that a lot of young people are very transient\nScary he thinks the registered they originally so he doesn't really feel attached to Nevada and he felt like you didn't know much about Nevada politics and this is something that I Would say we hear a lot about the other big thing I've heard a lot from young people about is transportation and just sort of logistics of trying to get to the polls and they may not be stakeholders either younger voters\nAnd that they don't have kids in the schools like ... there are things that happen later in your life they get you more engaged in politics even at just at the local law but there's also this belief that they don't think that they know enough which I Wonder if the if this is a factor of just being young when you look at surveys you'll see a large percentage of young people say that they don't think they know enough\nTo be able to vote and so therefore they don't want to cast a ballot for someone if they don't actually know who this person is and I've heard that by just knocking on doors and talking to young folks as well\nAnd yet what's fascinating is if you look at millennials which are on on on a whole older than just Eighteen to twenty nine there are there are about twenty two to thirty seven people born between Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen Ninety six is how few defines\nRon tell us about the potential downsides to these plans these\nPlants don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so insurers don't necessarily have to cover all those basic things that people think that Obama Care guarantees they will get perhaps including maternity care perhaps including emergency care perhaps including an ambulance that takes you to the hospital after a car accident\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars and patients from a larger insurance pool that makes Obama Care worked\nSo in that way it's one more way that the White House has managed to undermine law because they couldn't repeal [noise]\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up on some of the headlines that we might have meant because of all the other ... thank you Ron\nThis is the politics show from NPR we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right

every week through the mid term elections we're going to be here with us special broadcast breaking down the issues on voters five [noise]\nRepublicans just say just tax stores in the history of our trucks\nRepublicans one thought them major tax cut they pass we'd be their best selling point headed into the mid term but\nThink voters are on their side on this issue it's an all out looting of America the wholesale robbery upper middle class\nWe're going to dig into the policy of this big tax law and how that's affecting the politics to do that we've got to NPR reporters who covered that more than anyone else on our team Kelsey Snell and Scott Horsley hey guys hey how are you going to be with you\nSo Kelsey you cover Congress um they passed this thing let's talk about what within it can you give us a quick recap of what was in this big tax bill\nThe big things that I think people will remember the most is that Republicans cut the top corporate tax rate from thirty five percent a Twenty one percent they also made things a little bit simpler for individuals they made the standard deduction almost double\nBut they also lowered the cap on the mortgage interest deduction it's that thing that people use after they you know buy a house and they are paying interest on the mortgage payments they conduct that well they were Republicans decided to cap that to help kind of keep the overall cost of ... and check\nAnd they put a cap on the state and local tax deduction which is um when you live in a state that has a particularly high a state tax you could write some of that off\nThat is also a limited now those things are primarily benefits that go to people who itemize their deductions on their tax forms so it the impact really was spread in on evenly across people with different income brackets\nJust got this has been a lot of the land for almost a year at this point do we have any sense of the economic impact\nI hate to say it but it's really still too soon to tell but we do have kind of competing stories we have seen fairly robust economic growth a second quarter growth was over four percent we're in the ballpark a three and a half to four percent for the third quarter when that number comes out later this month [laughter]\nThose are pretty healthy growth numbers private economists and the c._e._o. forecasters they think this was a short lived sugar high that people are are getting more money in their paychecks spending it and that's all going to wear off pretty quickly Scott\nI'm going to stop you right there you said TV show that is the congressional budget office that the independent agency that I'm sort of calculate the economic effect of congressional Paul\nYeah they're the nonpartisan official score keepers for all ... all the bills that go through Congress to deal with taxes and budget\nMore optimistic forecasters notably at the White House thing no this is a lasting change that companies are going to take their tax savings\nPut that into new plants new equipment new machinery that's going to make workers more productive and that we're going to see sustained higher growth for years and years to come and it's really just too soon to know which of those competing narratives is the right one\nBasically we're going to go into the mid term elections where people are going to vote not really knowing the answer\nWhat we do know however is that government revenues have taken a hit from these tax cuts and as a result the federal deficit has ballooned\nDid does not add a hot matter of conversation on the campaign trail as far as I can tell\nThe deficit has certainly receded from the public consciousness you might remember back in the early days the recession it was kinda high on the Republican agenda that Republicans in ...\nAround a trillion dollars in the current fiscal year but you certainly don't hear Republicans talking a lot about this and you don't hear a lot of Democrats talking about it either\nWhen you do hear Democrats talking about it they seem to be setting it up as a binary thing you know Republicans\nWanted to cut taxes for the wealthy while also doing away with government benefits that people want to you and so it's not usually message from Democrats as as just a tax cut is bad but the tax cut his bad which means the government can't spend money on programs that are popular\nYeah I guess the challenge for the Democrats is they have to be careful in how they criticize a tax cut lest they be accused of wanting to re people's taxes which they often are is this the the great thing that Republicans thought they were going to be able to campaign on or not\nRepublicans have really backed off of campaigning on it and that's in part because you know the polls have been bad for the tax bill for months and months and the polling average that they use of aren't real clear politics shows than thirty nine percent of people approve of this and forty two point five percent disapproved\nAnd you know the tax credit had kind of a a momentary high watermark back early in the year when there were a lot of stories in the newspaper and on TV about companies that were paying one time bonuses to their workers\nA and and for a nanosecond the tax cut was enjoying fifty percent approval\nBut that's been sinking now for the better part of the year and it's now trading right around where President Trump is forty percent or lower and that's that's a tough sell for Republicans I think if if you'd asked Republicans a year ago when they were crafting this tax cut\nIs that where it's going to be a as we approached the midterm election they would be disappointed you know that's where it wound up it\nThe tax bill becoming sort of a non issue\nWell again Democrats are going to continue messing ... messaging tax cuts as the binary to win the no Republicans wanting to cut other things that Democrats like like health care like Social Security like Medicare\nThey will continue to message it that way and you know Republicans may be hoping that this starts to bear fruit for them not in twenty Eighteen but maybe twenty twenty\nI think you're going to continue to hear competing narratives Republicans will talk about this as an investment in the health of the U.S economy that will pay fruit that will pay dividends in the long term Democrats will talk about it as a deficit ballooning give away to the rich that's going to put the squeeze on entitlement program\nFor them personally in April well after well after the voting is done that's right", "year": "2018",
