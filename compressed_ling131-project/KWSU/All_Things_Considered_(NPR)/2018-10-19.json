the first time he has talked about caravans he talked about a different caravan back in April\nA this is a new one um and it's getting a lot of attention on cable news ah and so he is talking about it again he suggested at that rally without offering any evidence um he made a claim that Democrats were somehow behind the caravan\nBut they don't want the ... and there are those are the caravan didn't

there's really no evidence to back up fifth conspiracy theory that that he's been able to offer a but you know the reason that he is talking about this and talking about illegal immigration is that

governor most state lawmakers they are all Republican but that could change because waves of Latino will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state and to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called policy it's about eighty percent Latino [noise]\n\nI'm into restaurants are being ... and tacos and I bumped into a guy who had to give the Republicans\nSome hope the way we handle our

reflects pretty bad um\nThere is reason Hernandez view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJust ... heads the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to still win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie but she knows will turn Arizona majority minority I twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens\nTwenty Eighteen could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote so the\nQuestion for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join Thirteen [noise]\nAnd not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern feeding and the district at state representative Tony Rivera\nHas any of your friends or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say they'll say um how could you be a\nRepublican and when the Republicans don't support 'em Hispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd it's just one of them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party he mesh perfectly with Latino face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as the knock on doors [noise]\nOnly minutes two minutes of the time I was told me was there on

their answer from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I pulled side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country of an opportunity I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration for me and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them I ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino votes\nLegalize or people who are here who want to work hard we're looking for opportunities and wouldn't eat increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThat sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans were trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor ... who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI have to see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection Doug you see on the ballot edits Doug do seas agenda juicy\nHired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz is a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt would be asked to approach do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may make calls for the is not suggesting on border security that we need to stop them when you to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that now I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nBut under that logic if Republicans want to repeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric\nAnd there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that like Abel Hernandez remember him a truck driver who says immigrations that deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way pita\nThey see what's going on to see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to go you go to ... votes and they said that we were ready to go with them\nIn other words Hernandez\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona

of the ... and the idea that that a committee led by Mohammed bin ... on the crown prince is going to investigate something that he has been implicated in\nIs going to lead it a lot of questions I think around the world there is no Robert Mueller and the kingdom and it's going to be very ...\nTo raise their show first jump in and let me let you just give any more detail the Saudis think TV is providing what exactly was the student to my\nWell as you said they they said that it was a a fight that I'm In which he died a which was a ... sounded rather odd\nI'm given the fact that that the Turks have been telling us that there were Fifteen people there are the Saudis have I don't even fight that really uh the Saudis have said that I'm Eighteen people have been arrested now in this case um\nSeveral people have been relieved from their duties and that includes um a royal court advisor who's\nClose to crown prince Mohammed bin ... so you know it it it's obviously getting close to him

much confidence should we have in this version of events um given that it is a completely different version of some of the one that the Saudis have been sticking to before yeah you have to remember

migrants well let's bring in a reporter James Frederick who is there in Guatemala hide James\nGarner lose so just yesterday you were describing to me a relatively calm scene at the border a lot of security but migrants who were masked a few minutes away from the border what what happened today\nThis group of migrants has now grown to ... we don't know exactly how many uh but thousands of migrants now decided they were going to march can bridge that connect Guatemala and Mexico and they said they were going to try to enter Mexico today\nIt was a very chaotic scene but uh you know for him just try to summarize it as quickly as possible [noise]\nAh they were at the fence walking them from leaving Guatemala to got through that Ben's thousands of people started walking across the bridge into Mexico Mexico has closed up big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear ratings for this caravan\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots that turned out mostly to be here down or that they were using it in some of my friends and then the gate shut again [noise]\nUm it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from his father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nDon't feed them up\nFor what it opens up a [noise]\nThen there's chaos broke out she had to pour

of\nHeat stroke a and dehydration as well as some people who actually suffered a broken bone in a class with Mexican and\nAs you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they
