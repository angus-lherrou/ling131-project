black women vote in large numbers and they overwhelmingly vote for Democrats Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and help to eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party\nWe recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country but we did it go round the women around the circle and here in Washington DC included schoolteachers\nPolitical organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos and commits rating about politics they actually did not know each other very well once they got settled then they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hats that followed the presidential election\nThat the Trump will buy the women's murder\nTrial or this is Michelle nearly she works and communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism posed twenty sixteen too little too late in ... opinion now in twenty eight team it's time for the midterms ... believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted um I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with\nUm everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama with black women who delivered that W that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focused on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty\nTo Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters what is\nThe use of it he's gone away from family we show what is\nWhat is why why you\nKnow\nAnd that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice area\nI think their chances of being real and that ... we had a stronger voice would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it's actually missing urgency there's nothing to do\nI answer Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nGet relationships in the middle of it because I was in the ... and the other is legal but they say something life whole he fits the profile\nMy dad used to my story there are all star game we use a little bit\nLike every day in the pros\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything or be a bird's resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and in and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara late right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuse says she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this boat or block more seriously\nI think in this moment we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd sort of black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we used to be brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and\nBlack women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republican but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion and right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats\nWho have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as a relief to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle was on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus was on pack\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CB feed a directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions about who to back and not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the

alleged scheme last week it involves a woman who said she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller\nCar does not specify the nature of those claims of the specials ... special counsel's office was you know is usually very tight lipped about I did decide to speak about this uh and it says it immediately referred to matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part has not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purporting plot\nYes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence of his earlier this month in ...\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars\nIn exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Mueller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down an individual with an empty provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual working\nFrom the okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the engines being gaining here the\nTiming is indeed curious yeah the ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV ah which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy\nBerkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember a round the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty sixteen uh a theory that has since been debunked some of the news organizations that covered it have actually we're attracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what ... is the first of Mueller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead and write he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller the bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor moral is this\nThe special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller\nVery weird

actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you are on a dollar would have gotten used six point to you on in late march today and gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade Linda Lim an economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen you're on fall if it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they selling it and buying dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand meanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker\nThe strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda that President placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make them more expensive\nSo Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim that\n... well partly counteracted\nTrump has so far impose tariffs with ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much in the spring which blowing their impact\nLim says the following you on may also have another impact foreign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and below project\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're starting to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency is helping it absorb the blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR

the market for coal just collapsed suddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near when it had been and he had all these loans he couldn't pay back and the Chinese court ruled loud one
