live at the [noise]\nMy mom has a nickname for me uh by and Cantonese\nAnd and I had to suppress\nThat curiosity acting\nAll of those questions because when you're born a kid of immigrants you're taught a guiding set of principles on which to live on keep your head down learn English go to school get good grades go to college Mary yourself a nice Chinese husband\nHave kids by a big house for yourself and keep quiet\nAnd so these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them\nBecause I was born and raised in Manhattan's Chinatown which was bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me\nMy mom worked odd jobs and sweat shops and ah in Chinese bakeries my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker and when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brothers would take turns massaging his back\nWhile I'm doing all of this I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America\n[noise] and so I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents and if the U.S versus China and I asked my dad who are re rooting for [noise]\nI joined ... of course China\nBut we're here in America I thought I couldn't ask that\nQuestion though because when you're\nGrowing up here you know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause the rocket strike but I found my way to figure out\nThe identity issue when I was Thirteen I was\nExcited to watch a PBS documentary about me becoming American the experience [noise]\nSeen three people who ever looked like me Jackie Chan Shereen either yellow power ranger [noise]\nAnd moon line a cartoon character [noise]\nSo I'm so excited to watch these last twenty minutes which talks about people marching and protesting people who look like me they're holding clever signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all of these people will go on the street and risk their identity their life\nNineteen eighty two was a Chinese American man who was beaten to death\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers prices in Detroit\nWhere Japanese companies were booming and people thought the Japanese were stealing their job they fought the guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party [noise]\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest wants his funeral and that the next week the two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and paid three thousand dollars for the men stuff\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Philippine next people are now saying if this happens to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us\nAnd so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian\nAmerican Asian American I never heard that term before\nAnd Vincent Chin must have been so important and if he had brought all of these groups together so my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching the documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points to screen she looked ... photo and says that your family\nWhat\nI have all these questions who was the how is he relate isn't easy like a cousin of a cousin of the cousin have I ever met him no I haven't met them because I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two but I'm Wondering like what happened\nI look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish in her eyes\nThat she didn't look like he had wanted to tell me that but I think she felt she had to tell me\nHow could I ask all these questions how can I ask the bottom murdered man in our family I had nothing to stay at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt or\nDo I decide to do research like I ... and I was a kid I start looking up articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and they can't find a single copy\nMovie the movie featured heavily Vincent Chin mother ... ... and when all over the nation under Phil Donahue show crying out I Want justice for my son\nShe's featured at her house in the suburbs of Detroit feeding her relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes China set up the filmmakers boyfriends\nAnd she was speaking in my native tongue choice and ease at some\nMoments during the documentary you could see little each and trying to hold back her tears because at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because the woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nAnd she was rallying as she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself I have to find out who lily tennis because if lowly chin is indeed my family and she's related to me than high I have an example in my family of someone who spoke up to be a\n... again to be a busy body curious and be proud of that you know\nSo now I'm like I have to find out who lowly tennis and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place where I think I'll get a full answer the city where Vincent Chin lived and died Detroit and I take an eight hour mega bus to Detroit [noise]\nMy friend picked me up and I

launch the so called supervised injection sites as Bobby Allyn of member station WHYY reports Trump mistreating officials are watching and promising crackdown since\nEarlier this year officials in Philadelphia have been studying the idea of a supervised injection site where those struggling with addiction bring their own drugs and use under the watch of medical professionals\nThe creation of the nonprofit called safe house is the most significant step so far and making that a reality one of the most prominent board members of the group is former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell twelve hundred\nAnd Seventy Philadelphians died of overdoses most of them die alone in your twenties Seventy so highest rate per capita of any big city in America we've got to do something to stop\nOther cities grappling with the opioid crisis including New York to Seattle in San Francisco\nAnd recently vetoed a law that would help open one saying it would enable illegal drug use its up positions shared by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein who told NPR in August that the Justice Department will not tolerate the opening of a supervised injection sites in Philadelphia\nIt remains illegal under federal law and people engage in that activity remain vulnerable to civil and criminal enforcement\nMessengers Rosenstein um incorporate or a safe injection site nonprofit an incumbent arrest me first\n... says his brazen position takes him back in time to the early Nineteen nineties when he was mayor and welcome Philadelphia's first clean needle exchange during the AIDS crisis but offering clean needles to drug users is one thing inviting them into a building to use illegal opioids is a different matter entirely\nRound the gold fine with the AIDS Law Project a Pennsylvania is another board member of safe house the new nonprofit she agrees that it's a controversial idea but the model has saved lives in Canada in Europe\nThe idea is if today we can prevent that fatal overdoses and we can build that relationship of trust then maybe tomorrow or even later today we can encourage that person to get into treatment\nOr their city officials are not directly involved with the nonprofit

all tech considered\n[noise] this month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting uses facial recognition technology it's in our phones and some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good an in house that she or is this technology to answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome and now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but\nIn airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it\nWas there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed ... use of this software\nYes there hasn't been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system\nWhereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images that when elimination as good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task you know one recurring\nIssue though we keep seeing is facial recognition technology that missed identifies people of color much more frequently than it missed identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen\nYeah this is a really excellent point\nThe current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many many images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races so you're saying there just\nA lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem techno\nBlue color yes oh the answer to the question technologically it's quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question\nDo either win facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use the technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understand where this science is today how do you think about this\nUm is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies
