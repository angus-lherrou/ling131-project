... had been missing since October second that's when he was lasting entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Seventeen Days ago\nMultiple news reports had pointed to his likely death but this marks the first official confirmation NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me now from Istanbul Hi Peter I'm Mary Louise what'd you told you we have from the study announcement\nVery few details of the Saudi press agency is saying Eighteen people have been arrested as the investigation is ongoing or but as you mentioned there is the first official confirmation or from Riyadh the drum up showed gee uh\nIs dead he was last seen going into the Saudi consulate here in Istanbul on October ... seconds\nAnd according to the uh Saturday press agency after he entered the consulate there was a fight to dispute that broke out and that led to his death we we don't know any more details on that right now\nSaudi TV is reporting you mentioned Eighteen Saudi\nSacked from their position was do we know who these people are are any details about ten\nWell a major general Ahmed Asiri was first mentioned to my knowledge in a New York times report this morning that talked about\nHim as someone who might be being lined up to take the blame for this a lot of questions have been pointing of course at the royal family\nIncluding a crown prince Mohammed bin some on as the man who was in pretty much total control of Saudi Arabia and of many folks have been saying that this probably could not have happened without his knowledge and possibly without his order\nA but at this point the Saudis are saying that this intelligence officer and advisor to some on ... has been sacked and also side could Tony who's an advisor to the real\nCourt so possibly a strategy to to uh put some scapegoat out there and the questions are mad in terms of who was giving the orders for this operation let me ask you this is Peter what do we know about timing why put this out in the middle of the night there from Saudi Arabia I Can't answer\nThat really um there have been a accelerating investigation certainly and the pressure has been growing a\nAfter initially uh being rather cool to the whole idea of President Trump has been a saying there will be severe punishment if the Saudis are found to have been behind this\nAnd it seems as if there is a move in Riyadh now or to move ahead with this and not continue with their initial statement which seemed to be more and more untenable\nI Am going to the Saudis statement tonight explained in any way how what they're saying now is completely different from what they were paying two weeks ago\nThat's not explained a but it is completely different the original explanation has been um he walked into the consulate you needed some paperwork he walked out within an hour and we don't know what happened to them that has been the official on the record deposition ever since this happened on October second\nP.

considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly in Washington and I melted Chang in Phoenix, Arizona\nPresident Trump is campaigning here tonight Arizona is a state where the G O P dominates politics right now both US Senators the governor most state lawmakers they're all Republican\nBut that could change because waves of Latino will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from ...\nNumber of Latino voters in this state and to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called policy it's about eighty percent Latino [noise]\n\nI'm In a restaurant serving port those out guidance and tacos and I bumped into a guy who gives a Republican\nIn some way we handle our homes especially in Hispanic community is the way Trump wants to run the U.S [noise]\nRamon bearing owns a small business repairing floors he's a registered Republican and he says he appreciates the values Trump\nStands for security order you know you need a certain order in in your home\nYou know the issues that came with the wall you know building a wall it is a good idea\nBecause I just installed not even two weeks ago a security door on my door I already have a door but I Would have better daughter when you're a ... year old son he's fourteen years old and it's funny that he told me somehow that door makes me feel safer\nIt made me think you know that you know it doesn't make sense more more metal their keep\nThat war people out you know\nStep outside and within seconds you'll run into people who vehemently disagree with parents like evil Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the names that are coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to a ... status you've seen the kid's been separated from the families of the water I think all that restricts pretty bad on the Republican Party you ask me\nI mean who is holding all that you know propping up the gender\nThere is reason Hernandez view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\n... heads the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to still win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority I twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens\nTwenty Eighteen could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote so the\nQuestion for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters\nSmall part in northern speed and the district of state representative Tony Rivera have any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say while they'll say um how could you be a Republican and when the Republicans don't support I'm Hispanic so they don't support immigration\nReform and there's just one for them is take a look at all of the other values that the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latino face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district actually knock on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take two minutes time I was telling you they're almost be a Republican running for realize I'm I'm here to answer any questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nIn the ... that show that people focus too much on the people calling from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news that doesn't look good\nWhen like you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised the children are from Mexico and this is an issue where I go sideways with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws\nBut I think that to the country is an opportunity but I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans up smarter and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them I ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalized for the people who are here who want to work hard we're looking for opportunities and wouldn't eat increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThat sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republican who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor ... who's running for reelection this year against\nLatino candidate I'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still I asked to see if the Republican\nAnd uh in in the reelection aj Doug do see on the ballot edits Doug due to the gender do see\nHired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz is a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt wouldn't be as you approach do the for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for fears not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them when you to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nBut under that logic if Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him a truck driver who said immigrations that deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way cheetah\nThey see what's going on to see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to go to ... votes and they said that we were ready to go over there over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party's state may already be field for generations to come and as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party

S. and focused on this question of does this represent a diplomatic crisis for the United states with Saudi Arabia which has been a strong ally for generations\nI think that Saudi Arabia is aware that they really messed up here um you know they've arrested I think it was Fifteen people in the last hour they announced that they've arrested more than just matched five others but I have a change of the latest statements from Saturday\nI think that they definitely need to you know rethink what they're doing and the way that they are going to treat American permanent residents are living in our country [noise]\nEJ I'm lost tortillas thoughts on the where this leaves the U.S Saudi relationship going forward\nI think the relationship is in crisis I take the comments from some of the Republicans in Congress or suggests that as well as a Democrat and I think it's fundamentally put to bed this notion that mom had been some some on M.

be Guatemala Mexico border that is where thousands of migrants fleeing Central America for refuge in the United states have been masked end whereas today they broke through an immigration barrier and tried to enter Mexico from Guatemala Mexican security forces appealed for order\nWade in these things to Mexico for its efforts to stop these so called caravan he has also said he will close the U.S border to these migrants so let's bring in a reporter James Frederick who is there in Guatemala Hi James\nI'm Mary Louise so just yesterday you were describing to me a relatively calm scene at the border a lot of security but migrants who were masked a few minutes away from the border what what happened today\nThis group of migrants now grown textiles and we don't know exactly how many uh\nThousands of migrants now decided they were going to march to the bridge that connects Guatemala and Mexico and they said they were going to try to enter Mexico today it was a very chaotic scene but uh you know if I can just try to summarize it as quickly as possible [noise]\nAh they were at the fence walking them from leaving Guatemala they got through that spans thousands of people started a walking across this bridge into Mexico Mexico has closed up big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for this caravan\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots or that turned out mostly to be here or gas or that they were using against the migrants and then the gate shut again\nUm it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from their father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\n\nFor a while but among [noise]\nSo what he said was that she went to the front with his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then there's chaos broke out she had to pour water in his children's either they got tear down it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their family it was it was a really rough seen\nSpeaking of the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly are you [noise]\nSo I'm back on the bottom all inside of the border but still right here near the bridge and and several of the migrants a couple of hundred so far\nHave drifted back into Guatemala I'm sitting right next to a couple of cops are from Guatemalan Red Cross they're treating people mostly people who are really the hydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the cutting hours probably four years old has a\nHas a cold rag on his head so Guatemalan authorities are trying to treat people who suffered a lot of\nHeat stroke and dehydration as well as some people who actually suffered broken bones in the classroom\nDoes not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border and across this bridge [noise]\nA lot of people I talked to said we are going to leave this bridge what their requesting is from Mexico to let them and\nHas asylum seekers and so they many of them say we are not going to lead us friends who are going to block the bridge into Mexico lactose and given the clashes today Mexico has totally closed the border or you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to have closed for everyone\nA show it's it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around we're not going home\nIn ... seconds we have left teams I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and advance getting to the U.S is the goal of these people are they aware of the president's position [noise]\nThey they are aware of that a Trump does not want to let them into the country for what they say over and over again as we know that his fans but we're asking we are pleading for help because you know whatever Trump parts in front of us\nWhat in fact at home is worse than whatever trend and put in so\nThank you that is James Frederick reporting from Guatemala Mexico border\n[noise]\nNorthwest public
