incredible Lindsey Graham gave a definition of this over the weekend to ABC News he said that would involve all the witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford said we're at the party\nAnd it also includes Deborah Ramirez who made that second claim that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a college party here's the thing that's unclear it's whether the FBI could or would broaden and talk to college classmates who have come forward saying that Kavanaugh wasn't telling the truth when he testified about his drinking habits and other things like that\nA flake was in Boston today here's what he said about what he wants the scope to be\nThat does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually need to find out where we can find out\nAt the same time though a Senate Republican leaders are moving forward you've seen them and the White House stepped up their efforts to play up the evidence that undermines what what Ford said and backs what Kavanaugh said and

S. M. C. A. NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nPresident Trump has long railed against NAFTA calling at one of the worst trade deals ever negotiate it but in the White House Rose Garden this morning Trump's celebrated what was billed as a new and improved trade deal from call it a positive step for both the country and the world\nOnce approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreement in the history of our country with the most advanced protections for workers ever developed\nIn signing on to the deal candidate agreed to open up bits long protected dairy market at least a little bit Trump says that means new opportunity for American dairy producers to sell their products north of the border including milk butter cheese yogurt\nAnd ice cream to name a few I Want to be very specific\nBut Canada is still expected to buy more than Ninety percent of its dairy products from Canadian suppliers former U.S agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack who now heads the dairy export council says the new deal is an improvement for American dairy farmers but not by much\nWe're looking at an incremental increase in excess were not certainly looking at a an opening why do the market but we are seeing an increase\nMore importantly perhaps the agreement is designed to prevent Canadian dairy farmers from dumping surplus skim milk powder on the world market at what the us views as artificially low prices\nAnd exchange for these concessions the U.S agreed not to scrap NAFTA Arab process for resolving trade disputes even though Trump wanted to preserving that arbitration process was a top priority for Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau when you're trading partners ten times your son\nSo go have reached a tentative trade deal more than a month ago but Canada didn't agree to sign on until late last night just hours before a White House deadline Walter do cautions there are still hoops to jump through before the deal is finalized the threat of a trade agreement that left Canada on the sidelines has been averted\nWhat I can say is that free and fair trade in North America is in a much more stable place than it was yesterday\nMarkets rallied on the news with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining nearly two hundred points Trump Trudeau and Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto are expected to sign a deal within sixty days just before ... leaves office it

Ari Shapiro\nThere'd been a lot of books written about chaos and dysfunction in the Trump White house the latest built by Michael Lewis looks lowered down the food chain that parts of the government that don't get as much attention like the department of commerce and the department of energy\nThe book is called the fifth risk Michael Lewis welcome back to all things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story's pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people's time\nCreating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them and\nThe Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces are empty and nice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out when\nI'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up [noise] well\nThe real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at a place like the department of energy but you write about [noise] so\nThe department of energy could just as easily be called the department nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean the stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election knowing shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him\nEventually kind of a month after the election the Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to\nRoot out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he he comes for an hour listens politely and leave and and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside an apartment\nBut they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that hey ... from it especially didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency was supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside the department of commerce there's the national weather service\nThe national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts the person that the Trump and missed\nPaying for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem when the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and the downside to knowledge what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investment in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with people to make profits fracking whether\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term cost of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme in his administration and the way it's running the government\nThat it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think the deal they do with their conscience is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term\n[noise] are these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs [noise]\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit\nA so those are people who have made a career out of those people who really know really know the jobs and the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump still hasn't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government\nSo there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended his book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named miss Finley and she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that now [noise]\nWell first let's explain why miss family wanted airborne going\nHer husband killed himself in Oregon\nAny longer and which he doesn't imagine is that with the same tornado that's going to come take her bart is going to destroy your house and she didn't want that\nAnd I thought it was a kind of a lovely metaphor for what Trump voters imagine or how their imaginations worker how the human imagination works\n... imagines the destruction it wants and imagines the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government it doesn't imagine all the collateral damage she doesn't imagine the damage it will actually do\nAnd I think this failure of the imagination is somewhere near the center of what we're going through right now [noise]\nMichael Lewis ... new book is the fifth risk thanks for joining us today\nTomorrow on MORNING edition California Governor Jerry Brown\nSigned topped net neutrality regulations into law\nOn the train station has filed a lot of California's new law classes with federal policy tomorrow here from the professor who came up with the term net neutrality you can ask your smart speaker to play NPR on your local station tiny [noise]\nAnd they see is northwest public broadcasting [noise]\n\nThanks again for choosing to make this station part of your day I'm\nAnd all things considered [noise] all the FBI has just days to finish it finished its investigation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh do\nQuickly you could do a polygraph of all three people involved in the alleged sexual assault good polygraph all three of them [noise]\nMore and what else the bureau might do given the short timeframe at four thirty five [noise]\nPrograms you enjoy in northwest public broadcasting I made possible with financial support from listeners like you and for Blue Cross of Idaho has not for profit insurer Blue Cross of Idaho negotiates with providers to create a variety of health insurance coverage in care options for its policyholders details at B.

to limit the FBI investigation that was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support Kavanaugh unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices back then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year\nBut back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who
