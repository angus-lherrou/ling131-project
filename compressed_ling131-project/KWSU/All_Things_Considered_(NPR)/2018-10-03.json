A. dot org\nAnd from the listeners who support this NPR station from NPR News\nThis is all things considered I Know that Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro Jason Kander a Missouri politician seen as a rising star in the Democratic party and the favorite in the Kansas City mayors race is dropping out candor is a veteran who served in Afghanistan and today he said he's falling out of the race in order to seek treatment for his P. T. S. D. and depression\nNPR's Quil Lawrence covers veterans and the VA and he joins us now like well how or tell us more about Jason Kander a Democrat with deep appeal in a deep red state\nRight a he's a lawyer he was a former Missouri secretary of state he did a tour in Afghanistan as an intelligence officer\nBack in two thousand six and came home and got into Missouri politics he made a surprisingly good run into deep red state to unseat Republican senator Roy Blunt\nIn two thousand uh sixteen and if you've heard of him you've probably heard of him from the dead hundreds in Kansas\nSenator boy and he's in an empty warehouse blindfolded and he's assembling a are Fifteen style rifle and the while he's doing is he's talking about gun rights and he says he supports gun ... supports gun rights but he also support background checks\nHe says to keep terrorists from getting one of these and then the gun is assembled and he takes off the blindfold and he says\nI'd like to see some of the foreign do this and\nThe ad gone in national attention he later had a best selling book about lessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic presidential candidate in twenty twenty so it really does seem like a rising politician the Democratic party\nAnd his decision today to part of the race came as a surprise and I came with a very honest and emotional letter message a tell us about it\n... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and you've been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago\nUm he said that when he should have been celebrating for example a having a raised a record amount of funds in his mayoral campaign he was actually in ... in crisis and he was on the veterans crisis line the Vietnam veterans crisis line in tears saying that yes he had\nBeen having suicidal thoughts\nUm so he decided that he should take a step back from the campaign and from the organization who started something called the let America vote which is a anti gerrymandering in at the voter suppression organization or he says he's getting VIP treatment\nAnd that he's not permanently retiring from politics he's expecting to be back\nEven with all of a conversation about and support for people who have ... how much stigma is there still today\nWell I mean there's a lot of stigma and and it can also depend for example on what stage are out of the military career if you're active duty military and you raise your hand and get treatment it can make you under deployable so a lot a lot of people will hide it because they want to be able to stay in the fight\n'em and uh I mean I Can't think of a politician who's disclosed is sort of thing except usually on the you know on the tail of a scandal that's going to come out involving some uh misbehavior\nBut uh I mean this is a serious crisis just last week the VA release statistics saying that suicide has increased especially among tenders generation of veterans and Cantor said he wanted to do this in part to help others confronted in public that it isn't a sign of weakness\nIs NPR's Quil Lawrence thanks ... thank you are now we turn to Amazon which has become the largest company to commit to the minimum wage of Fifteen dollars an hour\nThe retail giant which is worth almost a trillion dollars thanks a lot of criticism after disclosing earlier this year that a medium salary at Amazon with less than twenty nine thousand dollars that's just a little over the federal poverty level for a family of four NPR's Alina Selyukh reports\nAnd Amazon corporate executives stood today before more than seven hundred workers in California where housing and told them they are getting around [noise]\nDave Clark he told me this was one of the best days at work and the Twenty years has been at Amazon I should note that Amazon is one of NPR sponsors I reached Clark adds that California warehouse\nWhile we're announcing now in dollar minimum\nFirst for all Amazon workers in the U.S fulltime part-time temp and seasonal Amazon says that's about three hundred and fifty thousand employees total I asked Clark how much a warehouse temp job might pay at Amazon\nNow are low after ... facility was just under seven dollar range of over Fifteen dollars\nThis already far above the federal minimum wage of seven dollars and twenty five cents but still Amazon's bay has been facing a lot of criticism as a company ballooned into a global giant with half a million employees many of whom are drivers than warehouse workers\nAmazon is the second most valuable American Company it's run by the wealthiest man in the world CEO Jeff ... [noise]\n\nTwo weeks ago a group demonstrated outside of be the beach and Washington protesting the wide gap between basis because wealth and the wages for his lowest paid employees\nInside they spoke to several hundred Washington Power brokers and he was asked about the growing attention that Amazon was getting from critics who think it's become too big and too powerful ... said scrutiny like that is good for society\nAll big institutions of any kind or going to be and should be examined scrutinized inspected\nToday in his statement about the Fifteen dollar minimum wage ... said the company listened to its critics one of the most high profile ones had been Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\nHer to give credit where credit's going to bring those but I did the right\nSanders has long been campaigning for better conditions and pay for minimum wage workers including at retail and fast food restaurant\nHe has introduced a bill called the ... act which stands for stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies the bill would tax large corporations whose workers rely on federal benefits like food stamps\nAnd our hope and believe that I'm On the computer will cause other companies like Wal Mart a fair for them to start reading that when she was real good for American workers\nAmazon is not the first big retailer to make a public show of raising the minimum wage target plans to get to Fifteen dollars an hour by twenty twenty Costco had fourteen dollars this summer but Amazon is now the country's second largest private employer\nI thought it was great news I don't see how could be other than good news\nIt offers an economist at MIT and he said there are\nIt's high demand for workers one interpretation is look it was going to have to raise wages any way to leave markers tightening uh so it just you know decide to get some good publicity out of that\nAutor says no matter the reason it's important to remember that raises are good for the workers who get them their local economies lower wage workers so that they do tend to spend extra earnings\nAnd kind of surprising way that Amazon made waste day it's saying that it will lobby Congress for an increase in the federal minimum wage however Amazon Dave Clark told me the company does not plan to Bush for a federal minimum all the way up to Fifteen dollars\nWe think is the right number will even to the earth and Congress but\nSenator Sanders said he hold the baby the stamp of approval convinces the rest of the country that Fifteen dollars an hour is right now so you NPR News\nWith all the news happening every day it can be hard to keep up so check out our podcast up first you'll get the biggest stories and about ten minutes it's available every weekday morning wherever you get your podcasts\nThis is NPR News\nIn the northwest public broadcasting\nComing up next on NPR News station to its marketplace on your NPR in classical music stations all things considered we'll continue the Supreme Court has ruled that a convicted killer has to have rational understanding of why they're being executed but what if someone with dementia\nWho doesn't remember even committing the crime\nTotenberg will tell you all about the ruling at six forty on all things considered I'm Tom cocaine good evening [noise]\n\nNorthwest public broadcasting has a mission of enriching the community through programs which engage enlighten and entertainment and pop up to the financial support from listeners like you and businesses like Pullman regional hospital and each side marketplace if humans are quite the public station visit end up ... dot org [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Pullman", "day": "03"}
