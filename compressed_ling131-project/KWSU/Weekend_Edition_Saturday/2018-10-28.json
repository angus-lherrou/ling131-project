{"month": "10", "state": "WA", "station": "KWSU", "content": "This this weekend edition with special coverage from NPR News I'm Luke ... Navarro we're watching a press conference and he's about to start in Pittsburgh this morning\nEleven people are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people were injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it as a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning\nHighly though [noise] ah we're waiting to hear from officials uh what do we know so far about the victims well\nLet me know eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as a day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals memorial service and I will do be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nThis alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what\nSynagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened well authorities say the shooter with at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was as an as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\nThis into context for us so there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRate I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and\nUm well it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the ... one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying\nOne of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all this mass murder is a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in\nDecades and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning rate um\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and\nStill I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nLots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun you know laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the they're sort of a ... a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner\nAnd and this was you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes\nGrappling as they as they do it and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were a vigil last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm an end to the grieving is really just beginning here\n[noise] I think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding [noise]\nYeah well I think mentioned there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight\nLocal children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want to save and comforting place it's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's\nUm and and so that's just one small thing into communities doing to try to help Stanley's I'm Jewish and otherwise ah throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around the country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it yeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now [noise]\n[noise]\n\nYeah incredibly moving and somber what has been the response from elected officials so far [noise]\nIt depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy and we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence at a normal part of American Life\nAnd it's something that has become more and more common place in American Life an unless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon addressed a shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside but then a God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president knows with adjusted that perhaps bringing back the death penalty what helped the tour such attacks worse noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states\nFor that to be more of the conversation and obviously President Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti\nSemitic attacks and that this was a hate crime right and\nAnd he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a\n... and said that this is he said essentially that this was a you know stick thing to do um he's he's certainly called it out I'm a ... of course you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense does it uh what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise] well I\nThink it needs to chew Asian than and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there's a there's a search for why after the the Las Vegas shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for a crime that they can prosecute and investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere is also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community and in this case there are as we said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant a motive that\nTold us something about why this might have happened again that still under investigation but um it is being investigated as a as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why this happened and also we'd like to know more about about the victims soon\nI'm going to bring in a are Mara Liasson now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the terms um and a lot of people\nMara good morning good morning [noise] so I ... the president's response and and basically how we are actually starting this press conference now I'm living their lives\nTo offer our most heartfelt condolences and prayers to the victims of yesterday's senseless acts of hatred and violence to the families and friends and to Pittsburgh Jewish community and to the larger community of Pittsburgh the Jewish community of Pittsburgh is one that we as pits burgers treasure\nIt's an important part of the cultural and social identity of Pittsburgh\nAnd so this was an attack upon our neighbors\nAnd upon our friends and one that we felt very deeply\nThe fact that this attack took place during the worship service makes it even more heinous a place of worship is a sacred place it's a place of peace in a place of grace to place where community comes together to celebrate that that they hold most of the year and most sacred\nUh the the um the sympathy that they need it yesterday evening at the uh\nI'm a synagogue we I'm a synagogue and ... all eleven victims ah before they were removed and brought from the synagogue last night to my office uh\nUh we've been involved with a for rabbis from the synagogue elsewhere uh they can have a continued presence there at my office uh during the process uh uh I'm\nGetting give you the names of the victims now and he's will be available to you or afterwards or Seventy five year old and Joyce Feinberg of Oakland or\nSixty five year old Richard got free to Ross township Ninety seven year old rose ... scroll hill sixty six

eight year old Melvin wax squirrel hill in sixty\nNine year old or being younger of mount Washington\nOut of the body that are currently at the medical examiner's office autopsies have begun on those uh we are I'm I'm ah doing everything in our power to complete the process in a way that honors both civil and religious law and I'm a\nCause and manner will be released to the media as there are determined to we have not established timeframe worked for this we're only in the initial process of evaluating what will be required\nIn shock and grieving as you can imagine my colleagues and I joined the authorities are asking for your pleased to be respectful of the of the needs of for the time and space as they deal with this tragedy uh today in the coming weeks they will need to know that Pittsburgh go supports them as a lifting them up like your\n[noise]\nHi I'm Jeff Finkelstein I'm the president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of greater Pittsburgh [noise] um so I have to begin by saying that I've seen this room a lot of times on TV and I never thought I'd be at the podium [noise] um [noise]\nThis is an awful awful period for a Jewish community and uh and especially for the families who have been affected [noise] and it's real when once you hear the names were going to do everything we can to help the families how we're in the process of doing that now\nAnd will be there for them and be there to help our Jewish community and the Pittsburgh region a shield from this\nI Want to echo a lot of the things and gratitude that people have already expressed to local law enforcement types of the FBI\nUm to to ... an army the red cross of all been there with us yesterday at the Jaycee see\nI Want to thank my colleagues at the Jewish community center and Jewish family and children's services especially\nFor really stepping in to work with a with the families um [noise] and um and you know we will we will definitely get a will get past this and be a strong Jewish community like we've always been thank you um and I asked the mayor to come up\nNow [noise] extra [noise]\n\nIs a strong town [noise] we are a resilient city or we had been knocked down when we found ways to stand back up and we've always done it in one way or working together\nTo the victim's family to the victims friends we're here as a community of one for you we will be here to help ... built a horrific episodes will get through the dark as day of Pittsburgh history\nBy working together squirrel hill is the most\nBecause of the diversity of the community the Jewish community is the backbone it is part of the fabric of Pittsburgh and we will be there in all communities to support our friends in the Jewish community\nWe um [noise] as I said it had been knocked down before but we've always been able to stand back up because we work together and I have to take a moment to think those that spoke earlier the effort that was put in across multi jurisdictions\nFrom the federal to the state to the county to the local\nWas something that we should all be proud of\nThe fact that we were able to work together as one community suburban medics coming in voluntarily to take on different areas of our city because all of our medics or after seeing\nOur medics deciding on their day off to voluntarily come in to fill seven additional ambulances to back up our officers and the officers who came from our surrounding counties the federal agents in this state troopers and the county officers all working together\nIn order to be able to make sure an episode\nThat will forever go down in the history of this city is one of the worst moments that we have experienced\nWas able to be less and because of that coordination\nInto those that are standing behind me who spoke early earlier the professionalism that was exemplified through their leadership for something that we need it at our darkest time [noise] to our officers who are in the hospital into one officer who's been discharged the thanks for the entire city go to them\nThey're sacrificing their knowing of the danger that they put themselves in in order to be able to protect others there's something when they put on that uniformed that we should understand\nThe sacrifice but they make to their family members the city will be behind in there to support you in anything that you may need [noise] and finally\nTo those that are not familiar with Pittsburgh to those says in his given a their words of not only confidence but support to Pittsburgh from around the world around this nation around the state thank you\nNever win out that those that try to divide us because of the way that we pray or where our families are from around the world will rooms and in Pittsburgh we're pragmatic and we find solutions to problems\nWe will not try to rationalize rational behavior we will not try to figure out ways in order to lessen the degree of crimes such as that we will work to eradicate it we won't work to eradicated from our city\nFrom our nation in our world hatred will not have a place anywhere\nAnd we will work locally to make those changes happen and we will work with partners around this country and around this world to make sure that it adds one I think again all of those in this room\nThe elected officials who are gathered those that have worked on the front line of public safety those that worked within public works in other parts of the government in order to be able to ensure the safety of our people and will open it up to questions with this time\nThat was ... built into us You're

car but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case Caesar salad is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn now to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida could mourning mourning Louis [noise]\nAll right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect they opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation well are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested a so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources\nMake all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge um CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help are getting a picture of how he became this extreme [noise]\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and body building a night life and then two years ago all this anger a political anger starts coming\nSort of on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale in Parkland the community that had that horrific school shooting the sheer that's only about Fifteen miles away sort of in northwest edge of a of Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I began making all these attacks against David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud he didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nUh the financier who's been in the news so much lately in in ... in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you've spoken with coworkers including one who was in that than\nYet Deborah gr Reagan was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nSat talking about Sandler he last Hitler Hitler\nWe should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre thank you so much thank you living\nIn these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity politics weed and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by Nicole Anna Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me [noise]\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black Florida or the teen of voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a monolith black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters\nThough when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests and their very identities so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class votes\nAnd use medicines that we use for white voters what happens is we men tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and that voters of color are somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral and sometimes\nRight white is the default so\nI have treated frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voters I Need to go after suburban voters that there's a silent white in front of that statement\nAnd that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also decide accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people [noise]\nWell I think one we really downplay I mean we we solve this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election what we saw was that we did not see why people aren't voting a in a racialized away because\nBy knowing their rates were say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that issue and in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald shop and to the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why ... is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nAbsolutely and so this also I think speaks to\nVery unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country\nMany journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles so when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago but\nThe racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also the sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair\nSo how did those two things then said when you're trying to discuss some of these racial divisions in this country [noise]\nWhen I was clearly argue we're all biased I think the way that we covered the election showed that by to be very very clear because we were ignoring literally ... voted on the ground were saying right with voters on the ground where say\nNo I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's boss a job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt and we were like no no they don't know what they're talking about it it's\nIt's economic anxiety so that's biased but also when we talk about fairness is it fair is it accurate to say you're talking about suburban voters if in fact you were only talking about a segment of those voters were white\n[noise]\nFrom NPR News in Washington DC this weekend edition [noise]\nUnder the guise of our good morning eleven worshipers were

feeling frankly scary the shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock\nAre we getting getting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to us all\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric and also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nSchachter teaches sociology at Washington\nLucas ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her she says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail we want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nWhere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks\nFollowing the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election now we came back from that precipice during the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at that precipice again and it's similar\nLine between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo peas position on health care\n[noise] definitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election or the hot issue was the Affordable CARE Act\nSo we've now seen three instances in which elected officials are targeted physically after a period of very ill and political rhetoric\n[noise] there is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders we've had moments of turmoil and thinking of you know white supremacist and the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise]\nWhat sets this moment apart in your view\n[noise] the phenomena are we seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls from major U.S corporations we're

Santa borrow\nA terrible shooting in Pittsburgh bombs in the mail this is a fraud political moment and here to help us make sense of it as NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson good morning thanks for having me [noise]\nSo obviously I'm a terrible news out of Pittsburgh we got the names of those who I'm actually were killed by this in this attack yeah\nLet's just make a few things clear this was the worst anti Semitic attacking us history it occurred just days after the largest\nAssassination attempt on political leaders in this case all Democrats and targets of the presidents in us history and we're not going to have the big debate about whether extreme rhetoric including some of the president's rhetoric\nHelped insight this thought the president has made a lot of unifying statements he said these acts were evil\nAnd politics as usual although he said that he's going to try to tone it down a little bit and he did but just before a rally in Illinois over the weekend he had this to say about his tone\nI Would like to be able to have its own but I have because I feel very strongly about it and I have a much different John frankly the press was even handed the press was fair I'd have a much different out all the time\nSo in other words the press is still at fault but as I said we're going to have a big debate about whether some of the president's words helped create the climate for these kinds of attacks he's not responsible for the acts of crazy people\nBut there's what the president says and then there's what people here you know the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA posted on social media that Jews were funding the caravan Donald Trump has tweeted without evidence that George Soros was funding the caravan he talks about global is a lot and in the right wing media like Breitbart the Daily Caller global list is a synonym for Jew\n... and this is the president who has not really embrace the role of United and chief no he doesn't believe in that other presidents have seen their role is sort of the moral leader of the nation\nBut he doesn't believe in that I don't think he'll change she's over Seventy years old and this kind of extreme rhetoric has worked for him he believes that energize his base\nHis closing argument in this election is based on race and fear of crimes fear of immigration and it's kind of a social media business model you know the algorithms that YouTube and and other social media organizations know that more extreme content keeps viewers\nOn longer and this is what the president feels works for his base and that he might tone it down a little bit but I don't think he's going to give it up\nAs you note maternal elections are just over a week away will live and to this past week affects the elections and if so how\nI think for the most part the fundamentals of this election are set they've been very stable with the landscape for Senate races leaning towards Republicans in the house the trend seems to be leading towards Democrats I think the biggest way this might affect\nThe elections is that it crowds out talk about politics the president has complained about this he said Republicans were on a roll we had momentum now all the media wants to talk about it\nNational political correspondent Mara Liasson ... thank you so much thank you\nThis morning we've been talking about the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs to prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case she is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida could mourning mourning the\nAlright I'm so he's been arrested what should be what should we be looking for on the legal friend\nWell we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate on Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect that he will be sent to New York perhaps fairly fairly soon New York will ah it seemed to be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation well are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested a so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources\nMake all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge um CNN has reported citing a source\nThat uh he apparently was making him in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help are getting a picture of how he became this extreme [noise]\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a\nSoccer and bodybuilding and night life and then two years ago all this anger a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he is when I Lived in a van hung out on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale\nIn Parkland the community that had that horrific school shooting this year\nThat's only about Fifteen miles away sort of in northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale and say I begin making all these attacks against David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog\nOn Twitter saying he was a fraud you didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nThe financier who's been in the news so much lately and in Soros in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nGreat again was a manager at the new river pizza\nI Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nSets sail out hey last Hitler Hitler\nWe go back to that society with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre thank you so much thank you losing leading up to the mid term election season we've been looking at what voters will find on their ballots the governor's races the different kinds of ballot measures well we've just got today and one more Sunday before election day so it's time to look at the too big a house and Senate\nWill do the Senate person would do it with NPR lead political editor to medical to narrow good morning to medical good morning ...\nA third of the seats and the senator up as the constitution requires Democrats are facing some tough math but then we started hearing about a blue wave how's that water looking\nWell look the blue wave is certainly real but it's more likely to be in the house than in the Senate and that's because in the Senate there are a lot more a steep that are held by Democrats in red states that are up you have the worst landscape and the direct election of senators\nIn Nineteen fourteen for either party that's because you have twenty six Democrats that are defending seats and just nine Republican so will the Republicans pick up seats and\nIt's very possible in fact a you know some handicappers are looking at a potential a best case scenario for Democrats\nBeing net even right now it's fifty one forty nine in the Senate and a more likely scenario something like two to three seats lost four and when I talk to Democrats at the beginning of this cycle and through this cycle they were hoping to sort of be able to hold serve so that they could have a better landscaping twenty Eighteen where they could go on often\nThe best target for Democrats as in Nevada with Dean Heller and Heller is actually started to do a lot better a lot of those Republican a defense is a lot of those those Senate seats or\nArizona Tennessee Texas Nevada they've all started to try and a little bit more Republican in recent weeks while Democrats like Heidi Heitkamp are are not looking so good Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Democrats are really really hoping that in Indiana Joe Donnelly can hold that Jon Tester in Montana can hold and\n... yeah Florida's one of those races the Democrats are starting to feel a little bit better about you have the incumbent\nThere a Bill Nelson and they're feeling better about it because the governor's race or with Andrew Gillum or at the top of the ticket for Democrats he's doing pretty well against Ron does fantasy the Republican and Democrat thing that may be Gillum could poll Nelson over the line\nSo you have an energetic newcomer actually helping an endangered incumbent and you know that's interesting yeah absolutely it's really fascinating\nNation to northwest public broadcasting what the credit card thank you but credit card do expire so if your bank sends you an update the card please take a moment to give us a new

Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nI mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mentioned their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for white voters\nWhat happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and that voters of color are somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so\nI was treated frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voters I Need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental\nBecause we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting the story Democrats don't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\n[noise] what are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people [noise]\nWell I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw says leading up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election what we saw was that we did not see why people are voting a in a racialized away because\nBy ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue\nAnd in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack and so by instead\nFocusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say white but aren't voting it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nAbsolutely and so there is also I think speaks to very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journals are unable to actually call out the dog whistles so when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means\nOr go but white voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and would everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously that most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organization and specifically the fact based media want to be fair\nSo how did those two things then said when you're trying to discuss some of these racial um divisions in this country\nOne I Would clearly argue we're all biased I think the way that we covered the election showed that by us to be very very clear because we were ignoring literally with voters on the ground were saying right with voters on the ground where say\nNo I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also a job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and a change in our country like they were saying exactly how they felt and we were like no no they don't know what they're talking about ... ... it's\nIt's economic anxiety so that biased but also when we talk about fairness is it fair is it accurate to say you're talking about suburban voters if in fact you were only talking about a segment of those voters were white\nTo me that is not fair it's not fair to all of the people in a country that at this point is about forty percent non white who we are rendering invisible in our coverage\n[noise] Nicole Anna Jones of the New York times magazine thank you so much\nThank you very much for having me\nThe final season of the Netflix political drama house of cards debuted on friday and it's also the only

often seem so emotionally detached should have less compelling anti hero even when she does that talking to the audience thing that's bases Frank Underwood once did so well he once talked about the difference between useful and useless pains but when she talks about her own pain she seems curiously disconnected\nFrom it it's not true when he tells you here's ago\nThat there are two kinds useful

are creepy stuff that freaks\nSo it's really a story about facing your worst fear is it is so making with your worst fear well I'm afraid of most things [laughter]\nI really hate scary things right and I hate to be startled I absolutely despise that\nBut I recently went to check out this massive haunted house type thing it's on the campus of a former state institution so there are crumbling old

with a new imagine that pain what kind of have a really really debilitating kind that continues or thought your action\nWe're talking\nAbout basing our fears and sometimes the stuff we're scared off turns up in our dreams and our nightmare as the most vivid dreams happened during a specific stage of sleep random sleep hard\nRages elevated blood pressure rises and and you have all this narrow it to be going on in your brain\nThat neuro scientists ... he says that during REM sleep you're lying in bed your heart is beating and all of these neurons are firing the part of your brain that

that's probably why dream so often don't make a lot of sense\nAnd on the preset and at that point you have to go down and bravo and I said you mean get down on the floor and gravel and he said yes\nIt was this really be church and the dog and there's like Russia's our society\nMember like realizing I should be possessed I was going to do something terrific [noise]\nBy the way there is no real difference between the dream ending nightmare a nightmare is basically just a dream that stresses you out to do the crazy dream that we have during REM sleep have a purpose here nor a scientist belong to all all again\nSo one theory for why we dream or even have nightmares\nIs that it hadn't survival mechanism so if you and your dreams yourself I don't know like wrestling with a beer or something that is going to make you more likely you when you encountered that in real life uh be able to deal with a situation like that\nI don't dream about ferrets but I Do dream about being late for work or not being able to finish a project on time and it's always stressful but there is another kind of nightmare that sounds a lot worse than that you're completely\nParalyzed and you're half awake feeling
