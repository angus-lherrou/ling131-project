Virginia resident and you're right there are a number of things that we could do I'll tell you what I focus on the first thing the Senate did this week the members of the Foreign Relations committee on which I said is we sent a letter to the president to trigger\nIs a review of whether this\nTreatment of mock show you violate something called the Magnitsky Act Magnitsky Act allows the White House to\nPut sanctions on individuals if they engage in human rights abuses when we send a letter it triggers a hundred and twenty day investigative period where the administration has to report back to Congress as to whether there have been a human rights violation in what they're going to do about it that's number one\n... and working to potentially cease arms sales to them we had a vote a few months ago were forty seven of us\nVoted to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia because of their mishandling of the civil war in Yemen and the massive humanitarian crisis there so a second thing that you are likely to see I think Senator Paul and Murphy\nHave talked about this is additional action to block arms sales President Trump reacted very negatively that the other day but you'll see that and then the final one is us support for the for the Saudis and the U. S. E. on the war in Yemen and I think there is increasingly a desire to just\nA cease us support for the war in Yemen which is a massive humanitarian disaster so I think before we get into embassy diplomatic relations we've had a long standing relationship with Saudi Arabia\nBut I think there are there Magnitsky arms sales and support for the war in Yemen are probably the three areas where Congress has now most focused and and it is a dramatic change in attitude about Saudi Arabia as a result of this action\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed of financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement more at alliance for lifetime income daughter work\nFrom the three I O T powering enterprise digital transformation with artificial intelligence predictive analytics and diabetes solutions learned more is the three I O T dot AI and from the listeners to support this NPR station\nDishes weekend edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon hurricane Michael set several records when it came ashore this week on Florida's panhandle it was the most powerful hurricane ever in that part of Florida and brought nearly an eight foot storm surge that's an area in Appalachia Colo that shut the harder Florida's oyster industry\nNPR's Greg Allen visited the area and filed this report Appalachian coal is a small city just a few\nThousand people but it's tight knit and self reliant\nOn friday two days after the storm makeshift restaurant was in full swing on a downtown St hadn't gotten meals hamburgers sausages chicken Mac and cheese Lindsey shepherd says people in restaurants in town donated food\nWe did it yesterday you not\nA lot of time in the community\nThe jobs of who's lived here for ten years since Appalachian coal is communities that takes care of itself look around and she said you don't see one city official for county officials here\nThe people here we're community of individual it and people who survive on the edge of everything here\nA hundred miles from anything and that's why we're here we like it it's a lovely wonderful\nPeople have to get here\nHurricane Michael accessibility was a problem storm surge washed out entire sections of the main coastal road highway na da temporarily forced the closure of a bridge that links Appalachian coal live with its neighbor he points\nBut many decided to stay in the water lives just across highway Ninety eight from the bay so he stayed with friends a few blocks inland but he came to check on his place was surrounded by water\nI had to wait in his front door and say in Stillwater in there and there was um my cats was in there and swimming around me I didn't think that it's going to come up this habit ... happen again\nCertainly\nWhen he began cleaning up ... there were crabs in his house a friend found a snake [noise]\nCarmel no wonder was cleaning up her yard yesterday burning positive limbs twigs leaves left by the storm she works as a nine one one police dispatcher at the storm raged for the floodwaters began rising she says she took a number of calls from people asking for help and\nWe just told him you know you took your life in your own hands I Know it sounds Maine and cruel that when we mandatory evacuation widowed for raising and we're not going to put our guidelines on the line because you've decided to say and put your own life in danger\n... says there weren't any casualties from the storm in East Point or Appalachia cola although the people are OK many businesses aren't\nAtlanta's quality ... owner Lynn martini yesterday was sleeping out in the mud wine to clean up after a hurricane again\nWhere the water came up about three hundred and found a veiled and it lasted a wall and they found that the water came in that life\nMartinez business a retail seafood shopping restaurants took a lot of damage Thirteen Years ago in hurricane Dennis before that her father owned a wholesale seafood business into hurricanes in Nineteen eighty five wiped him out\nEven before the storm the seafood business here was in bad shape for several years now per water quality and apple electrical a base has led to a declining oyster harvest for Martina and others here recovery from hurricane Michael one more skilled decline\nAnd well well that yeah I don't take us a little town or made up pretty bad right now that we survivors we've done it before and the price we pay for leaving literally land\nTo begin the recovery Martinez says the first thing she and others need to get the power turned back on Greg Allen NPR News Appalachia cola Florida\nIn Georgia a number of civil rights groups are showing over tens of thousands of other applications that have been held up but just over three weeks before election day the vast majority of those applications are from African American voters the group show in Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who runs voting in that\nW. H. B. and Atlanta joined just Johnny thanks so much for being with us no problem what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up so\nNeither applications Georgia's system has flagged for air there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically they works like this right you have [noise]\nThere's just one letter off on your application maybe it's missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker input the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application it's frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this is the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote by you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting\nYeah and of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about not just conventional ... vote fraud as we've noted in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that borders the complaint that show rights groups are making\nWell the group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under ... office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy\nBut then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law that was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy undercount he's actually following state law and his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams to Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the race has meant\nShe is really going after a camp for this um she says everyone who can vote should vote

abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania not far from places you know\nIt hurt reading the report because I was reading about these parents has that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up the way to hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a\nAnything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion and then I didn't learn honestly until recently that\nThe abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense\nWhat I think it was early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever that newspapers broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing it wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I [noise]\nAnd a church or face\nI think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teaching of the Catholic Church\nMash did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh who has their own story to tell no I did not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with do you think the church cared more about it shelters and institution and less about the people who had been harmed\n[noise] it certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse seeing bishops than people whose names are plastered up on church building back in my area hearing that they\nSpent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up to ... to save the good name of the church I suppose [noise] instead of actually trying to make up for\nThe heartbreaking abuse there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care [noise] do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with because of the Catholic Church is is all I ever\nWas involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new area and starting a new a new part of my life and since the breaking of of of these new stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God I still have a faith and\nI just see much less of the connection between my personal faith and the Catholic Church\n... now of Washington DC thanks for speaking with us in such a personal way yeah thank you for having\nReporters got a rare glimpse inside a temporary

long division and there's a contributing editor of Oxford American at a professor of English and creative writing at the University of Mississippi joins us now from Oxford, Mississippi thanks so much for being with us thank you so much for wanting to talk to you [noise]\nWhen someone says do you tell me about your mother [laughter] it's not a simple question is it\nOh not at all not at I look forward to it that my mother that incredible model and like most Americans she just had a rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write\n'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now but they're right on the practice\nAlso enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and all out of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into\n[noise] well um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't want it to the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black women were dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was doing\nShe started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police why people would be even a harsher and those beatings just things started to give progressive way worse and\nI think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town and her partner also started to get progressive we worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state will join us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma\nIncluding for example the baby in June dirt from your mother debating the tree endured\nAll of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that is that's when I say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cost just traumatic thing but\nI Will say the layers of\nParticular kinds of abused be personal and structural I think let me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kids so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women have to deal with but I just eight\nEight eight as a way of hiding 'em\nAn individual you started to start as a way of attempt in hot and attempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between of which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball and the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and there's a sort of strange euphoria\nThat comes with a lot of times that starvation and I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I've had lots of running as police\nUs about it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller like I Would be okay like people wouldn't see me as such a threat and I kept that up for like\nThirteen Years so my body ...\nYeah [laughter] then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nMan I'm by the time and my body broke my body literally wrote from overuse wrote from not sleeping and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to their brought me some sort\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and it was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in that book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim and one in here that in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWhile I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there is a shame when we show people and tell people that\nThe money that we are able to make\nWe are unable to cheap right and especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself\nThat's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home that two hours feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something\nThat I never really understood my mother or anybody else in my family experiencing but I Know they were and that's actually do the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about\nThe physical abuse the addiction the gambling on both sides of my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now why do you care what she thinks oh\nI Love my mother's death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher at my mother and not love me enough to instill a practice\nAt an early age and this book in some way is like her investment I'm coming full circle she really believed that reading and writing can say\nAnd I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I wanted to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a chance to

what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nTo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for air there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government data bases so basically works like this right you have [noise]\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe is missing a high Finn or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker input the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application it's frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this is the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote by you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting yeah\nAnd of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about I'm not just conventional vote fraud as we've noted in this country but but perhaps foreign powers\nPlant that show rights groups are making\nWell the group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they said that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under camps office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy undercount he's actually following state law in his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams the Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the race has meant\nYeah she is really going after a camp for this um she says everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy I'm On the other side Kemp campaign says this is just a manufactured

virtue of of how they are playing right now I like the defending champion Astros Scott they pounded Cleveland in the American league division series three games to none by combined score of Twenty one to six\nUh and the red Sox beat the Yankees as you mentioned but to the winds were kind of nervous one run when so I'm like in Houston in this series\nTournament for the world cup Trinidad and Tobago where they were the ones responsible for knocking the U. S. men out last year right\nThat's right the bombs or to bring that up [laughter] it was a sad moment for the U.S men but we're talking about the U.S women are nearly always happy story the the game against Trinidad Tobago already happened it was seven a win for the Americans they dominated\nThe round Robin portion of the conquer calf tournament that's disqualifying tournament for the world cup the U.S had three straight victories by combine scores Eighteen to nailed\nUm but the U.S is ranked number one in the world Scott and and most of the ... competition not as keen as it'll be in the world cup next year in France tomorrow the U.S plays\nNumbers sixty four rank Jamaica in the semi finals of the conquer kept tournament and uh when will guarantee a World Cup spot even with a stunning loss there would be other avenues to get to the world cup so\nIt's looking good for the U.S which is the defending World Cup champion from twenty Fifteen\nYeah and uh and something that ah that every American should be proud of them they're doing a great job NPR's Tom Goldman so to you by the way thanks so much good to be with you to be with you [noise]\nBefore there was Saturday Night live the onion or John Stewart there was mad magazine of parodies jokes and cartoons that a lot of investors are those other enterprises grew up reading\nMad has been published since Nineteen fifty two and it's often considered less edgy than other avenues of satire but then the current issue there is a four page comic strip drawn by mark palm written by Matt Cohen\nThat spells out the alphabet with names have children who were or would soon be the victims of the school shooting\nThe piece is called the ghastly gun Chinese a take on the original ... drawn by Edward Gore in the Nineteen sixties\nMad magazines executive editors bill Morrison who joins us from their offices in Burbank, California thanks so much for being with us high Scott thanks for having me [noise] let me give people some idea a begins\nAs for al as the young science whiz and little girl is holding looks to be a science experiment be as for Brian cramming for quiz\nAnd then you begin to understand what's going on and as for nascent who's caught in the path piece for Paula protecting classmates this very powerful\nI'm writing this day and my calendar because it's the first time I've ever cried reading mad magazine\n[noise] we'll meet you [noise] um [noise] but ... D or the original alphabet that'll show was talking about bad things happening little kids and now it's something else isn't it it's like a clear and present danger\nYeah I mean Nick Meg line who is one of my predecessors as editor of mad used to always refer to mad as a fun house mirror sort of held up to our society and you know for the most part you look at that reflection and you laugh but sometimes you look at that reflection in your circle horrified\nThat's kind of situation we have here where you know we don't want to ignore this or we don't want to take a pass and say well this is one thing that you know man it's not going to comment on that we have to do it in a different way\nMore sober serious way\nYeah I I Can't get over the fact that a lot of kids as you know we'll be reading mad magazine I mean you an idea about the same time\nYeah I was about eleven eleven or twelve when I started reading math and are there was one piece that I really recall it depicted a soldier in a a welcome home parade in his home counties coming down the street\nDressed in his uniform instead of carrying a rifle he's got a big hype of Germany needle\nAnd it was commentary on how soldiers are getting you know addicted to heroin and other drugs and you know there was nothing at all funny about it but as a kid you know you see that in his fix with you and it it sort of I mean for me anyway really shaped the way I thought about things\nWhat would you hope youngsters would do or how they would reacted reading this today [noise]\nUm my hope would be\nThat just we're just open up conversations\nOn the very last panel of peace\nHas a little girl going back to school\nShe's passing the tombstones\nOther friends who were killed at the\nAt the previous school shooting and as soon as he is for his alley who won't be the last [noise]\nAnd that's something that kids are thinking about\nSo hopefully this will just keep a\nConversation going ah [noise] trying to figure out what we can do about it\nThank you Scott for my pleasure [noise]\n\n[noise]\nSomeone in Manhattan New York times they allowed a covert action in the New Yorker and WNYC studio ...\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick when we first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen it was often said that Russia had hacked the election we quickly learn to more specific\nMore accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages on Facebook and so on but they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems an altered the results not exactly now is foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be and you can say that lightly\nAn existential threat to American democracy but what we've learned since twenty sixteen is if somebody really did want to ... election it wouldn't be impossible not at all to help has been writing for the New Yorker about election security and what she's found should scare us all\nLogan lamb is a security researcher in Georgia I'm generally a curious guy I enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time in August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election it started posting around Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems\nWhich ran all the elections in Georgia\nOr in the course of doing that I did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... elections dot ... dot edu a Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website\nAnd generally that turns up reports or public presentation\nAnd this this particular searched didn't turn that up [noise] instead I found a very\nCurious links and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or names [noise] in some sort of Dennis ... next to their name and I immediately thought wow that that seems a little\nStrange and then he crafted a simple program to download that was publicly accessible from the George election website and they found in all of that data astonished him\nThe document and pain supervisor pads were to be used on election day there were all the windows ...\nYou know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected\nImmediately I followed my Bob wild is that doesn't look like sort of data they would purposely put on the Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself would be a huge story but on top of that land also found security hole through which you could download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their own name their address birth date lots of four digits of their Social Security number\nAnd their driver's license number\nAnd there were also Jim databases [noise] and uh gyms database or used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate er which does the final vote count [noise]\nIf Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would have been a bone answer [noise]\nScary scenario I could think of would be an attacker implanting malware on the\nPrograms that are placed on the electronic books were altering the voter registration databases disenfranchised voters an attacker could have compromised Web server and use it at the beach head to get deeper into the center for election comes networks [noise]\nThis is right around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system to protect it from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\n[noise] it wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally patched then more information started to trickle out\nThe intercept published the NSA report that had been hacked\nAbout Russian cyber attacks on election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen\nAnd later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers and a number of states including Georgia [noise]\nLook we have no idea if the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election systems and twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know [noise]\nThe midterms a few months ago the director of national intelligence that the warning lights are blinking red\nSome states took this seriously but others seem to have left themselves wide open [noise]\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand that they need to run elections that their authority but they're not cybersecurity experts Susan green hall is the policy director of a national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right\nUm so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a cross country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia\nAre computerized touch screen voting machines Georgia is one of five states that entirely had machine that don't have a paper ballot then there's also other machines which ... paper about those are all the computers and those machines\nCan be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why\nHaving the paper ballot it's so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what kept it correctly\nElection security folks are on the ground and people who are the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet\nAnd I wonder if you just explain why it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines [noise]\nMany of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location\nWhether it's the touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet it has to get programming information from\nAnother machine which is essentially desktop our regular laptop computer that program here are the candidates here at the races here is how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the voting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media\nAnd it's well known that if the device that is doing a programming gets infected with malicious software it it can be transferred to the individual voting machine\nThese machines that are in the polling location are equipped with wireless mode and to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night and those wireless modems go over a cellular networks and selling their networks are part of the Internet\n[noise] we spent a lot of time talking about hacking\nVoting machines or hacking vote tallies but there's this new way of hacking an election and it has to do with the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio North Carolina and Georgia that\nPurge voters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections of whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base [noise]\nPersonally that have been a concern for me because uh on election day and when he's sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names were in on the voter rolls or they they endured Kennedy you'd electronic poll book\nAnd people were showing up and they were being told you're at the wrong polling location or you've already voted during early voting or you already voted absentee or you name it than here or your address has been changed the vendor\nFor the electronic pull books was a vendor named the our system now VR sets and had been\nTargeted by a Russian intelligence spear phishing attack\nAnd um the state board of elections did their own investigation or as did the county to county report and has been made public it wasn't very in depth that didn't consider a cyber attack 'em and concluded that it was a poll worker our malfunction [noise]\nBut I think that's an open question as to what happened in North Carolina and election day [noise]\nWe heard earlier in the year that a three hundred and eighty million dollars was being released to the states uh for election security\n[noise]\nI Need another play\n[noise] will there be anything [noise]\nAnd he you know what [noise]\nThis one it was nearly\n... [noise] I'm grown in the\n[noise]\nThing and all the ... [noise] um well you know when you've been kissing me so long [noise] another one\nAnother\n[noise]\n[noise] um\n[noise] there's a few days of beauty isn't it you do you ever do you say you were texting within only about the songs that they do how much do you tease out what the song is about\nOh I didn't really I didn't need to I mean for me it for me it's mostly about climate change you know\nBut you you've been through a certain number of political moments [laughter] sixties and in many moments in between and just how does this seem similar a different [noise]\nUm it's just I couldn't have dreamed us up all the stuff I've been doing all the countries all dictatorships and uh you know I'm In through all that if somebody is had said can you write a story about how bad can it get I couldn't have written it nor could anybody I Know\nThat it's just you know what we are facing in the administration is evil\nAnd it's it's cruel it's there's no empathy zero empathy so um it leaves you release me thinking how am I going to conduct my life\nIt's you know it's the year the bully and um to bully people now seems to be okay to lying no problem no perjury and not a problem\nUm and said that that is a new normal and how\nHow does it change the texture of your life day to day waking up in the morning as you know proceed through the day well I think\nI mean I've heard other people say this to the law oftentimes it hits in the night in the form of this terrible anxiety and you realize\nThat it's real I mean it's not some neurotic anxiety anxious about the state of the world which is terrible\nAnd so one thing is to one of my things I suggest spend a lot of time in denial that this great advice yeah and um don't expect much I mean keep the bar really low yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary forget forget which one it was\nBecause the scene appears in so many documentaries abusing it the march on Washington\nAnd I I I just wonder how you visualize\nIn your mind moments like that in your life which are now distant and their iconic in the minds of other people but you you're there you're holding this guitar you are in a microphone and kind of lousy sound system and singing the half million people or what\nOr sometimes I Do or somebody to show me a photograph I think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said\nUm and sometimes going into a quote historic moment you know it and other times you don't know it um in that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah yeah\nYou you mean there's some there's some times a year in the middle of an event that turns out to be iconic and you have\nNo idea I think of all a political moment yeah\nI'm just thinking about Woodstock and it was a little bit of both because I took the last telecoms are in and looking down and seeing these people are like aunt you know they're just gobs of people\nAnd so I had a hand then of that this is going to be something very big but it was after the fact that you realize oh my goodness that's made a dent in people's lives forever\nAnd in your mind yeah\n... you know this next song that you're going to do I went to um Charleston not just days after the shooting to write about these families and these these ... relatives with people who lost people in the church there in this in the slaughter\nAnd it it was extraordinary and then the funeral\nThat followed um that President Obama a when too\nIt seems like a million years ago it was the idea of a a precedent I'm capable of showing empathy just such a degree that not only is the crowd with him in the field they feel like allies but he's able to sing\nThe song and begin the song that lift people up as opposed to issue a tweet that depresses hello [laughter] um yes how do you remember that that terrible incident and why did you decide to I'm covered the so [noise]\nWell covering the song was a no brainer I mean it was whatever feelings I had them or in the future that song just dropped out of the sky shouldn't by the way Milford I did not know and most people didn't know um\n[noise] I Need to tune students they started to get to [noise] I mean if I was Quaker a tune you can only mean knocking that guitar and you're killing I'm not going to hear hearing your loudly\nAnd they just go ahead yeah okay [noise]\n[noise]\nA young man came to I I don't know if the\nThreat than they did\nAnd I was brought him when he was not friend he was not keen but they open the door\nAnd they let him me [noise]\nAnd foreign now strangers they did that with them many seemed to print anything\nBut not young round to God and nine the loaded on ya [noise]\n[noise] Mm Mm\nAnd strong in the month of June Mm some mourners gathered and on the president came to speak some\nAnd the cameras roll and the nation on her you know you could\nSay what must be stay for all the living and and and\nSo on that day and then that the president saying\nI'm raising ... the president na ...\n... ... ... ...\nAnd\nWe are you ready to lay the blame on one man's page or our nation in the name from sickness but the minute\nOr so and how we\nMight be made oh\nNo no one could\nSay what must be said for all the living and that he\nDid go on that then the president\nSaying raising ... my president that made me angry too\n\n\n[noise]\nThe switch yeah that presidents in my president says is the only president you felt of this and that way but\nUm yeah and I had to decide whether I was going to use that are not because the only wrote it um my president I thought ... [laughter]\nAnd all of them they have to lie cheat and do all this stuff um but yeah I mean states money was smart he was carrying in spite of whatever the wars were you know and there were some Afghanistan you know I'm border crossings [noise]\nUm a lot of it it was just somebody I liked I like\nUm ... uh yeah I met him in the middle of a snowstorm and it was ... and I went and I met him and I had was freezing out on my feet has shrunk and I keep my high heels on they stuffed things in there for me you know I caught and wine or your\n[noise] bring everybody else to call it a shot grazed the closest to [noise]\nHe was incredibly good looking Henry met his wife Joanne at a party in London in Nineteen eighty nine\nMost of my friends friends they are wild and Wales so that someone in special forces was very very glamorous [noise]\nI'm actually I could trust paper\nI think it's great talking to people who are at ...\nHe had recently completed his selection course for the special ear service or SAS a legendary elite commando unit\nIn many ways he enjoying a were opposites she hates the cold or she could think of any more dreadful place in the world in Antarctica\nFor all their differences they shared a similar sensibility\nHe really was a tree romantic Hitler loved parent Trey\nHaters loved ah he he did tapestry\nHe's ditched the most wonderful\nTastes like chips gang across the snap\nHe loves the history of all these old explorer and send glamorize satisfied that his head and\nWe said that there was no\nHenry worshipped Ernest Shackleton many ways a was a failure as and explore on his first expedition that he commanded from South he set out to reach the south pole with three other men\nThey got within Ninety seven miles nautical miles to the pool but he feared that if he kept going his men who were already fading would not make it back\nFor the men for like a bell\nAnd so I made a decision that always is\nAnd on his other ... most famous expedition Shackleton had wanted to walk across Antarctica he started with the last great\nPrize to be achieved but before even reached Antarctica his ship out the door and got frozen in the eyes and Shackleton found him in all his men more room on an ice flow more than a hundred miles from the closest either with any contact with civilization\nWhat made it so amazing was he was able to guide all the men in his immediate party and get them back all home alive\nI Know that they have a very far ... three or four\nYears I was very interested as a child to golf Soviet injures captivated me a dollar raise in your car and it's a very very divided expeditions\nHe began to burn with this very peculiar ambition which very few share which was the kind of suffer these misery and become a polar explorer and the model that he lived by was a Shackleton family motto which was by endurance we conquer\nI should have had warning about when he came back from a trip to steal a jet just stuff Dr ... and was incredibly excited because he had managed to sleep beside Shackleton grave\nIt wasn't until\nWhen he was about four to ... that he started really talking about wanting to deny expeditions photo and shackles him such steps\nSo by the time that Henry was talking about doing his first expedition he had two children max and Alisa initially when he decided he wanted to do something that you know how many people say suddenly wait a second I Want to go walk to the south pole\nOr you know his kids were a little bit will dirt but a joy and it was very supportive\nParents about well huge believe as in trying to fulfill dreams and looks at the time my ridge still she's from still selling your an individual dream\nBecause you feel you have to get permission from the other person and I felt that through my twenties I had fulfilled a lot of my dreams that had lost\nWhere his town really\nSuffer his third trip he wanted to walk across Antarctica to fulfill the goal that his hero shot then was not able to achieve what he wanted to do it alone [noise]\nThey said there was during the ... you know to me [noise]\nBut the only one time off several times during the trial or not I am [noise]\nEach day with similar I mean Henry would get up early in the morning and they pack up his lead that usually took about an hour as harness we'll be connected to the black and you begin to haul it does not unlike the meals\nPlugging skiing for Ninety minutes taking a five minute break\nAnd he would walk with his skis burning as much as eight thousand calories than a day\nOr every craving food fish by buying brash double craze stations here smaller chip smoked salmon baked potato X Y spring\nHe would do this particularly in a time can challenge the day after day there was something almost primal about a Cold War he's\nKissing you their purpose became to just make kids mileage he had to achieve so many miles a day if he was ultimately accomplished physical\nNine blind coal fields ... today to

with other people you can take time to bad the from\nWhereas if you delete\nScare criticize miles [noise]\nHave time to quit playing my heart [noise]\nSpell\nThe constant strain of making his mileage so that he could reach the end point of the expedition before the end of the month of January because in February begins the winter season and the dark to cope with the temperature drops even further
