Scott Simon the FBI has a suspect in custody it connection with at least a dozen suspicious packages had prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump seizure say act was arrested friday\nFor being with us my letter a what a week a chaotic and concerning as they say with those type I'm showing up around the country from what you know now how the FBI cracked the case\nIt was really a clue pulled off of ah one of the packages that didn't remember when when these packages started showing up the authorities took a took charge of them sent them to the FBI lab in Quantico in Virginia\nAnd folks there than rent tests on them analyze them and they were able to pull a fingerprint off of one of the these bubble light manila envelopes that fingerprints matched say ox\nAuthorities say there's also possible DNA connection from two of the homemade pipe bombs that were sent to match because he was in that he was in the system right exactly be the because of previous legal trouble\nA DNA connection or appears to ... as well and then there's a third bit of evidence here which is from the digital world and that is a the FBI identified a Twitter account that it says belongs to say I\nAh some of the words that were misspelled on the packages a match the wrong spelling on his Twitter account and what more have we learned about this uh this man in the white van in a parking lot\nIs fifty six years old resident of South Florida registered as a Republican in March of ... of twenty sixteen there is a pretty a long trail and public records of his legal troubles he's face felony theft fraud drug charges\nHe was arrested over a bomb threat back in two thousand two as well he's clearly had financial difficulties over the years he filed for bankruptcy for example in two thousand twelve\nAnd then that filing he said that he lived with his mother that he didn't own any furniture\nA we know that he spent a lot of time at the gym and he also worked at a at a strip club or a lot of public attention of course has been put on this white van that you mentioned that authorities say belonged to say this of course is the one that was plastered with pro Trump stickers anti Democrat anti CNN stickers we've all seen a lot of photos of that or to the next steps\nWell he's been charged in federal court in New York with five counts those include illegally mailing explosives threatening former presidents he's currently being held at these federal detention center in Miami is expected to be in court on Monday\nOr not to key questions after his arrest for authorities are one whether he was acting alone or had accomplices\nIn to whether there were any other package is still out there and that's something that yesterday FBI Director Christopher Wray cautioned the public about he said there may still be more out there are as things stand the FBI has confirmed at least fourteen homemade explosive devices\nEach one had a six inch piece of PVC pipe small clock batteries wiring and potential explosive material folks that the FBI lab are still examining needs to see whether they are indeed\nThe the the packages were sent to prominent Democrats and uh and critics of President Trump um is there a political angle that seems to have motivated these actions\n... attorney general Jeff Sessions was asked that exact question uh yesterday and all that he would say is that say appears to be politically partisan part is an act and that's what he said but the motive will be determined by the facts of this case and that is still being sorted out because there's still

and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael Franz who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ad these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pet\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nHave you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV [noise]\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ad on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ad even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tend to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative a campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter the season on through\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being connected to a terrorist organization\nWe're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people in in question should be raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nWell yeah this is a tough one to um decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is that an all time high\nPolitical advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it as a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television has to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael friends are voting college who's co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us my pleasure and tomorrow and weekend edition Sunday Lulu looks at our political rhetoric and language may affect us and how we speak to each other you can listen to that story tomorrow morning by asking your smart speaker to play NPR\nOr your station by name\nAnd

there were some times maybe from innings fourteen to Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was absolutely riveting and in stunning\nEighteen pitchers used improperly by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best picture\nThe game tonight [laughter] well the Dodgers have named starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox manager Alex ... still haven't decided who he's starting later today and game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes\nNathan you've always got six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches\nHe was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him and the Dodgers Walker bealer we got a dealer dealers [laughter] if I was a brilliant this was two games you know literally was tonight in and games\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star or he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no team has ever come back in the world series from a three hour deficit Walker bealer goes that he throws seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits\nHe was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning to can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal when with Walker bealer being the start of the night does not LA now have anything\nLeft in the tank to win ... that's a good question to ask either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game LA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going in the game for but\nBoth teams are stocked with professional baseball players they'll figure out\nA way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now it will inevitably be wrong so the one thing we can say we've got a series now\nAnd uh it's fun Tom Goldman

NPR station\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon\nLast week federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint which described efforts by the Russian backed Internet research agency to use Twitter bucked to influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including\nIssues raised in sports Andrew beaten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact Russian trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem was beaten joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on why would you say Internet research agency [noise] interested in whether football players took a knee or not during the plane or the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord this\nIssue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just people that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic\nRegularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you were dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well what we found was these ...\nThe movement then we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University\nWho helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players\nSo it's interesting to look at that break down wonder how that influence the conversation\nStuart if it wasn't directing achieving a certain result just to destroy things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraud contentious issue\nAnd also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to trying to track to this debate [noise]\nAh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed correct\nYeah so the accounts from this study has been closed but you know what we see with the is it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up\nAnd one of the interesting notes that the constant professors had was that these are closed but they're monitoring new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations and they're continuing to weigh in on controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAndrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me

that stuff that's your job [laughter]\nWe know that what our audience wants is for us to make them feel a little better and if that takes a ignoring the bad stuff in focusing on the goofy them will do that if there is something goofy about the bad stuff will highlight that\nAll I can say is the worst of the news and sometimes it's been very bad\nThe more we feel an obligation to step up to the plate and really brings a silly [noise] you've had so many um famous gas including of course of a president of United States to two presidents of the yeah we had the rock Obama before he became president but I'm taking credit for it because he hasn't spoken to me since [laughter]\nAnd the second president the second president was Bill Clinton who period and post presidency that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job and the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions that are inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case that for example and we can show the audience that he's actually a very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about your own case but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human being I Love bill Curtis yeah how could you not and I missed Carl Kasell\nWe all you've had some great partners I haven't I've been blessed and I have stood on the

the country\nFrom what you know know how the FBI cracked the case\nWas really a clue pulled off of one of the packages that didn't remember when when these packages started showing up the authorities took a took charge them sent them to the FBI lab in Quantico in Virginia and folks\nEnvelopes that fingerprints matched say ox\nAuthorities say there is also possible DNA connection from two of the homemade pipe bombs that were sent match because he was in that he was in the system right exactly be the because a previous legal trouble a DNA connection or appears to match say as well and then there's a third bit of evidence here which is from the digital world and that is\nA the FBI identified a Twitter account that it says belongs to say that\nUh some of the words that were misspelled on the packages a match the wrong spelling on his Twitter account and what more we learned about this uh this man in the white van in a parking lot [laughter]\nHe's fifty six years old resident of South Florida registered as a Republican in March of ... of twenty sixteen there's a pretty long trail and public records of his legal troubles he's face felony theft fraud drug charges was arrested over a

out there are as things stand the FBI has confirmed at least fourteen homemade explosive devices\nEach one had a six inch piece of PVC pipe small clock batteries the wiring and potential explosive material folks at the FBI lab are still examining nice to see whether they are indeed functional bombs but\nRate was explicit about this he said be sure these were not hoax devices and of course the

is pumpkin spice and the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael Franz who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us my pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that\nWell it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pet\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nHave you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV [noise]\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter suggest the season on through [laughter]\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being connected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack is not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people in question should be raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do you draw the link between the tone set by some of these ads and the fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more Maine\nAnd the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high\nPolitical advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it as a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television has to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic and those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael Franz Bowden college who's co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us my pleasure and weekend edition Sunday Lulu looks at our

was a brilliant this was two games you know literally was tonight any games and for the first game Walker Mueller was the star uh he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh\nNo teams ever come back in the world series from a three oh deficit Walker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he\nWas fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning to can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal\nWhen with water ... start and then I does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win ... that's a good question to ask either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game LA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into games for but\nBoth teams are stocked with professional baseball

issues on your mind as a voter local stuff\nThat is maybe nothing to do with whether you watch Fox or CNN or even how you feel about Donald Trump\nReporter loss of Griswold has been spending a lot of time following racism in the state of Pennsylvania\nAnd what she found is that for voters across a wide swath of the state thing that's foremost on people's minds is a gas pipeline it's already under construction and it goes through a lot of people\nIt was exton Pennsylvania in the suburbs of Philadelphia [noise]\nAfrican is a place where two tectonic plates in American politics meat we thought Pennsylvania go narrowly for Donald Trump and twenty six teams in the Philadelphia suburbs are one of those places that political consultants like to talk about as kind of a bellwether\nAlthough the larger county went for Hillary Clinton accent is heavily Republican about two thirds of its voters are Republicans and yell from Austin is running as a Democrat for state assembly and she thinks she has a chance we gone rogue [noise]\nWe're on a leafy suburban street they're colonial houses which are made of Brett inside and was final it's a middle class place how are you guys and Danielle is

the beginning of the controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street\nAnd fighting the pipeline for the last few years is what motivated

we're here trying to connect the dots between what's going on politically nationally as well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national politics\n[noise] just an example of the egregious now of what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory role backs and how it really affects our daily life and how it can
