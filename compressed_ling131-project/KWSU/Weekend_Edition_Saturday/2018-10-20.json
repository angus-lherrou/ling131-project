yard in the world could see through that story Scott but it wasn't concocted to be believed any more than the earlier versions of the story the Saudis have now abandoned its intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual\nAnd that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales\nPresident Trump made that clear this week while he was seated with executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the

explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting uh give given up quickly in the past he has leveled\nVery blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like uh not dealt with the Saudis now\nOf this comes up as the president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana\nGiven at his rallies he is really trying to get the a C as hard as core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle the confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh calls Democrats who protested cabinet Kavanaugh in ...\nAngry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nOr any talks about say that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border and lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November\nWould be a bright flashing invitation every traffickers smuggler drug dealer and illegal alien on the planet come on come on and\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies and in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of your mouth to show genes\nAnd very Don Gonyea thanks very much for being with us thank you got\nThe Trump Administration has had a muted respond so far to the death of your mouth to show gee\nWe turn now to even adult or he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council on global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey as\nThe empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership ... thanks so much for being with us clout to be here based on all of your experience to the Saudi explanation of how Mr ... died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than they kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi or explanation by the president or how much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like\nBoth Washington and Riyadh for trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response to it let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nFall at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies\nTo work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen\nWhich by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries on to\nA point of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it\nBut there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries that are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet\nThis administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial up at a lecture and interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues\nAnd one would hope that a\nPresident of the leader of the three world will be willing to go out publicly\nAnd make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests\nAre and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage there are practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis\nThe president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior\nBut then a new ad

face of addiction can be just about any face an obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touch many ...\nWith her toddler son Hayden was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day from it but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old when production ... high school party\nA drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody up are shown metal and limbs and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age\nHer sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and starring Broadway musical than she really had the voice and I'm later on when she\nBecame addicted to drugs it was this real estate saw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from a disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs are I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really loved the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm into farm and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then it's often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again she drove more than one program I gathered yeah she tried many [noise]\nWhat made you sure all of this and your obituary\nIt was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define the way she lived and to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to extend the hope that we had from ...\nTo people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry the hope for them and our hope also now live with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter\nHer obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions medication assisted treatment things like math a donor buprenorphine there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver there aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing\nI also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people in that part of the reason that we wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one phase of that but so many people was addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son in her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her you know and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\n[noise] understand there's going to be a service from idiom someday there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nThrough song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing a Bonnie rate songs is just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared story\nSupport and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have

it's about billions of dollars in arms sales\nPresident Trump made that clear this week while he was seated with executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what is folks\nThe president made that clear this week by spelling out

tomorrow in Singapore But there's going to be a rule change at Wimbledon 'cause they don't want any more of those six hour final what do you think of the rule change to go to the uh what what what are they going to do is they are going to the library rank yeah\nAfter after twelve after twelve twelve and they're going to go to a tie break the way that the way that they do after the U.S open after after the ...\nI don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree I understand the reason why people do it why they didn't get to a big deal and I I get it I don't like it because I think that it imbalances the game to the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is six eleven or whatever we know they can serve a hundred and forty five miles an hour and\nThat they it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense then the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation with with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break\nA Howard thank you you're in San Francisco uh their commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and of course that's where John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists on the medal podium a thanks very much for being with us Howard was terrific thank you and the baby of and HIV positive\nTransplant part of the mothers deliver to the infant at risk ... try to be or what the child grows sugar and most likely die\nChild received part of her mother's liver and so far there has been no scientific

[noise]\nDoctor Harriet death riches and medical bioethicist at which Donald Gordon medical center that's where the transplant happened and she was part of a team of doctors will help prepare for the surgery she joins us from Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us\nThank you very much for having me on your show how's the baby doing\nAnd the baby's doing very very well we are very yeah after the ... century happen now and to see this child live and thriving under these circumstances with this world that case is\nObviously enormous the gratifying and it really makes us feel good about the decision we made\n[noise] will help us understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors should mere\n[noise] yeah so we knew that there was a really high possibility that three ... we would give this child HIV\nBut the other thing we had to wait is that the child had been on our way to list for and live a diner\nFor three times the average and the child was getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated and we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV what if the parents tell you [noise]\nSo the parents saying to us\nWhy ... nights where well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy wouldn't you consider us so there was this need that wish from the parents and the mom particularly who was the diner that she could be a diner and we had to consider that very carefully 'cause we have to make sure that we promotion and punch the autonomy of our patients as far as possible\nSo it was interesting that in this case it was very much motivated by a request from this very brave sets of parents who wanted to save the lives of their child\nDoctor Etheridge do think this uh this case the more people know about it will love\nWhat did I heard so you know a tabby stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's it's a multifaceted since I'm from South Africa although we have this very well integrated national and AIDS treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really hope to shine through what we've done here is that\nIf you're in HIV positive person and you're on your medication you are living in a normal life then that shouldn't pre cleared you from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you for having those options that HIV negative people would have\nAnd we hope that by showing that HIV positive people can do this that that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dent in HIV stigma\nTucked harried Etheridge medical bioethicist at which Donald Gordon medical center in Johannesburg thanks so

they\nLeading looking I didn't have to see [noise]\nOne world Trade Center in Manhattan New York or radio our protectionist ... studios and the New Yorker [noise]\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick the big story going into the mid term elections has been the possibility of a blue wave a democratic upsurge that's notable for the number of women running and for progressive candidates like ... or work in Texas\nIn Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in New York but another story in this election is the very opposite\nThe candidates were running as extreme is on the right openly white supremacist candidates even neo Nazis Andrew Moran has been covering the movement known as the alt right\nAnd he's watching how it influences mainstream politics injury you've been reporting on the fringes of right wing nationalism and all the associated movements people like my concern is that ... for example who was involved in pizza gate\nAnd you've also written about the Nazi website the Daily Stormer which is built on disturbed Nazi Laura we've seen a lot of this on the Internet but it's been many years since really far right white supremacist had been running for office in the United states of America when did this all start what did the origins of it\nIt never really not existed but in terms of the most recent resurgence of it um you know Trump has a lot to do with it I mean there there's always been dog whistle politics right and we should definitely notes that Democrats have engaging that Republicans have engaged in it\nBut it's not even really a dog whistle anymore it's kind of just a whistle you know there's there's there's more and more openness with people just espousing white nationalist views and that has a lot to do with Trump\nWill people would point out that when Ronald Reagan was for his campaigning for president he campaigned and give it a big speech in the show but county Mississippi and he talked there about nothing less than states rights and this was at the very least a dog whistle to the far right is that something different and why because he\nWas there for tonight it when people asked him he said states rights doesn't mean that when people ask Nixon what\nDo you mean by silent majority what do you mean by law and order he vociferously denied it they're not really denying it anymore\nFlirting with the line he he doesn't believe that these lines should exist\nSo what is what is Steve king's history what does he said and done\nSo Steve King of the congressman from Iowa he's a represented the western part of Iowa for Fifteen Years at this point he's running for re election in November\nAnd he he's very clearly into you know dog whistle racism he talks a lot about western civilization and European heritage and that kinda stuff but he always in the past would leave some plausible deniability and then just in the last couple of years partly because of Trump and partly because he has a Twitter account\nHe um has been saying things like demographics are our destiny and then he says we can't restore our civilization with someone else's babies\nThere's no way to read that that doesn't take our civilization to mean white people there's no plausible reading of it other than a white nationalist reading to see tonight well not really I mean he kinda gets called to the mat and says\nNo I don't regret saying that he doesn't take down to eat too doesn't delete them he kind of says oh this you know PC culture everybody gets called racist all the time you know you guys are always ... and stuff but he never walked back the actual substance nor does he ever like explain how that could mean anything other than white nationalism\nWell let's talk about what we're talking about let's listen to one of Stephen King statements about diversity this is from an interview that he gave to in Iowa radio program\nAnd when you START I that's the way the differences then you'll end up with people that are at each other's throats than adding up Hispanic than black and he predicts there'll be a greater number than whites that America I operate actors and extend the blacks will be fighting each other before that\n... what do you make of that or I mean there are there are much more extreme examples of his rhetoric than that but basically it's that's kind of a turning the tables have saying by talking about\nAh you know the black voting block or the Hispanic voting bloc anyone doing that is there for the race is Paul Ryan the speaker of the house was asked where do you stand on this and he waits three days or something and then I forget how long he waited but Paul Ryan puts out this very carefully worded statement that doesn't mention Steve king's name at all that just says\nWe abhor racism so in other words it's not like he's such an outlier that the rest of the GOP can very comfortably wash their hands with him and say he's not our guy he is the guy they're not pulling funding from him at least not in a way that they're making public\nTo what does it suggest about American politics that the most powerful leader and one of the houses of Congress Paul Ryan feel they cannot afford to read\nRead the tea leaves and they know that this is too big a part of their support base to give up on\nYou spent the last year marinating in the juices of what one could call a cyber ... fascism yeah unfortunately talking to a lot of people who are are the very most active players and voices in what your client ... fascism and\nWhat does it tell you about American political life\nLook I think it's not that everything has utterly transformed and you know we weren't\nWe weren't close to the brink and now we are I mean we're closer now for sure but um what is the brink well it can't happen here you know that that notion that you know yeah ... ... fascism could have happened in Europe but it can't happen here\nI think we're now all starting to see that there is no law of nature that says that the walls of the United states that we we we are in extremely flawed\nSociety with a extremely a dicey racial history\nThat perhaps uniquely so among the countries we're talking about democracy is a very delicate tricky thing right if Steve King is now going out there and just essentially saying to the people of Iowa hello I'm a white nationalist do you want to vote for me or do you want to go for the other guy there's no guarantee that they want to vote for the other guy\nWell let's talk about the other guy his opponent kings opponent is a Democrat and former baseball player named J. D. shoulder to shoulder and have a chance and what are the dynamics of that race look like\nHe's much taller so that's generally a good thing about sixty six six and he's driving around the district in Winnebago and you know shaking everyone's hand and being very folksy he's out fundraising king\nHe's still down in the polls incumbency is a very powerful thing in ... elections and king has been there for six terms with the district thing it's deep deep red if they say and king you know it's it's you you might not know this from looking at a Twitter feed but racism is not the only thing you know he also\nYou know once ethanol subsidies and he also says he wants to support farmers now\nHe's been in Congress for Fifteen Years he has sponsored exactly one bill that passed which was to rename a post office in Iowa so he's not the most effective legislator\nAnd now that we live in the age of Trump are there new politicians on the scene who seemed to be entering the stage or coming onto the stage in a way they might not have before\nYeah I think someone like course Stewart he was someone who the Virginia a GOP just thought would fizzle out and he's running for Senate he's running for Senate against Tim Kaine who will probably win\nWould expect I mean he he won the primary and his whole national image is based on being standing up for these Confederate monuments\nWe can't turn them down there our heritage he was born and raised in Duluth, Minnesota so not the heart of the confederacy are to the confederacy and Steve came by the way it used to have a Confederate flag on his desk in the Capitol building which by the way Iowa spent a lot of soldiers to die to fight against the confederacy so it's like gee I Wonder what that flag means to you\nIn New Jersey and the state of New Jersey or New Jersey congressman set gross and was dropped by the Republican Party after saying that diversity is crap that an outlier incident is at a very rare instance of the of the party standing up to some of its extremist voices\nYeah I think he I think the set Grossman thing was a bit of an anomaly I mean you have even more in most cases than that you have\nA guy named Arthur Jones in Illinois who is literally a Nazi who stands in front of Nazi flags and give speeches and he won a GOP primary in a district where it's heavily democratic and so they don't bother to run a lot of Republicans in these in these races so he's not going to win the general election\nIt's very scary that a literal Nazi is is running for office in Illinois and that and that this guy ... is running for office in New Jersey but those are outliers I mean so I don't want to paint the picture that\nYou know this is happening everywhere all the time but again the fact that someone like set gross men in New Jersey in New Jersey would have you know concealed his feelings a little bit more\nOf just a few years ago just a couple of years ago but now he's on he's unleashed he's unleashed he's linking to this a blog post you know calling black people inherently dangerous and you know he's just posting this on his website and then he says oh well I'm Jewish so I Can't be racist so\nI'm full yeah I can falsify that one of the ...\nCentury ago it was the second flowering of the Ku Klux Klan and they were Ku Klux Klan members in Congress Ku Klux Klan members in every business organization and chamber of commerce in the country um it was like a social movement in some ways Ku Klux Klan barbecues and block parties and all the rest\nThat General Flynn was providing false information ostensibly to people in the administration who were then providing false information to the American people we weren't the only ones who knew that\nThe Russians and do that too and because it was had become such a big public thing this is precisely the kind of information they would love to be able to hold over the head\nOf the national security advisor which made him potentially compromise compromise it's it's a black male sorted by what happened to 'em so I contacted Don McGahn who White House White House counsel 'em and told him that I needed to come see him right away\nTold him what we had learned that\nYou know the vice president a bit on face the nation and saying you know I've talked to General Flynn personally and he is assured me that there were no conversations about sanctions so you got the VP out there saying this step so we told 'em Mr McGahn how we knew that it wasn't true how we\nI Am a second time on January twenty seven yeah he asked me to come back ... was that different are the same or what it was it was a little\nDifferent in the sense that um he was a bit more combative I guess I Would say in this discussion and I you know testified before this sort of one of his first questions was what's it to the department of justice if one White House official lives to another\nAnd and what did you make of that [noise] um well I tried to explain\nTo him that it was a whole lot more than just one White House official lying to another which\nGod that would help people would be concerned about anyway but then it was more than that that the underlying conduct here that General Flynn having these discussions to begin with is problematic but beyond that again it's the issue of compromise that the Russians notice it provides potential leverage and this is a problem\nAnd we also thought you know the vice President Pence was entitled to know that the stuff that he was saying when he stood and you know in front of of the public\nThat that was a trip so we were trying to help them\nSo your second meeting with Don McGahn is January twenty seventh also on January twenty seventh I'm an executive order is issued yeah um\nBanning travel from seven Muslim majority countries did you know anything about that until there was this you\nKnow ... and that's the remarkable thing I'm sitting right there and Don McGahn office talking to him at link\nAnd he doesn't tell me that the president at this point has already signed an executive order and she said banning immigration from these countries and that the department of justice is going to have to be in court the very next morning defending\nThis so how did you find out about the travel there\nI was in the car I was literally in the car on the way to the airport and I get a call I was able to keep one aide with me wanted this to my principal deputy the top deputy the whole time and so\n... calls me and he says after you left you know I went online I was reading the New York times and it looks like President Trump has issued some sort of travel ban\nWe spent the weekend I'm trying to get our arms around and communicating with the White House um [noise] what is it that you're trying to do and by Monday morning I was told that we would have to take a position on the constitution\nAbout a conference room and it's been a very long time in there I'm Talking through what the challenges were what the White House position was in terms of the scope of the travel ban we talked about the different challenges by the constitutional statutory laying otherwise that have been filed [noise] um\nAnd at the end of that conversation\nI was not satisfied that it was lawful or constitutional and\nWhat troubles me beyond that was it it became clear that to defend the constitutionality of death I was going to have to send department of justice lawyers and to take the position\nThat this travel ban that applied just a Muslim majority countries had absolutely nothing to do with religion\nAnd this was in the face of all of the president's statements that he had made both on the campaign trail and after he had been elected and\nThat did not seem like the ... to\nMe but isn't it usually been job the department of justice to defend\nActions of the administration even if you personally would not have ... you know issued that order or you're the president's ... the executive branch's lawyers writer why wasn't that good enough for you to say I'm going to defend this\nWell it wasn't just that I disagreed with this on a policy ground perhaps the appropriate thing then today would be to resign if you can't be part of that um but not direct the department not to defend it but here's what's different is that\nI happen to believe no lick it should go into court and make an argument that's not grounded in troops but the department of justice [noise] I mean\n[noise] if the OJ stands for anything it's supposed to stand for what it is true and what is just [noise] so what did you do [noise]\nI knew that I personally couldn't be parked I'm defending this an argument something that that wasn't grounded in ... um but you know I thought about what may be the thing to do is reside\nAnd that would have protected my personal integrity I wouldn't have been part of this um but I was like just the head of the civil division or you know some other component of the department [noise]\nI Wish the acting attorney general of the United states and I felt like I had a responsibility to protect\nConfirmation hearing when I'm there were some senators including Senator Sessions\nWho they were all over me and my confirmation hearing about\nWhat I Would do if the president asked me to do something that with a mall for wrong and I think Senator Sessions said you know even if it's just something that would bring disrupt ... to the department of justice you know you're going to be asked to do that and we'll use saying that\nYou know none of them were asking me will you resign they were asking me will you say no and they were right about that it wasn't my responsibility in that position I think to resign I think it was my responsibility to sign\nUp so how did you say no they I mean it wasn't like a state public statement it was just the communication\nThat we have the we had there were communications going on at levels below knee and between me and Mr McGahn and I should the direct it to the department\nAnd then what happens [noise] um I was fired you were fired by Donald Trump before it was fashionable [laughter] hired by Donald Trump did that surprise you or ... how did you think the story was going to end the ones who said you weren't going to allow the travel ban to be defended\nLook I certainly recognized there was a very real possibility for like probability that I Would be fired in this in this context but I hoped\nThat maybe there was a chance that by doing this that would cause them to step back and take a breath and look at what they were doing and more\n... okay I Know everybody's got\nImpolite so loud [laughter] and I was kind of silly now doesn't it um but you know I did\nHarbored this hope that maybe they would step back they would have the kind of process they would get the kind of input on there would be real discussion about this um\nI had spent twenty seven years at the department of justice I loved that place [noise] um I did not want to have the period on my service they're being fired\nWhat what's your assessment of the whole series of events\n[noise] um\nI suppose you could say that the president had made a campaign promise and he was making good on that promise but beyond the fact that I Believe that\nThis is who we are as a country [noise]\n\nSally a long time Justice Department officials food the acting attorney general at the start of the Trump Administration [noise] Sally ate spoke with Jeffrey tube and at the New York [noise]\n\nNow I'm as you mentioned the travel ban was revised one and it was revised twice in the courts have struck down each of the versions including the third and final version until it went to the Supreme Court\nWhich upheld it five to four ... what's your view of the travel ban in its final form and the Supreme Court's decision about it\nYou know I haven't studied travel ban to read the same way that I did the first one that you know I I still despite the other ... you know taking out the preference for Christians\nIn western Washington you can expect mostly sunny skies for your Saturday it slightly breezy
