now ... sitting Supreme Court justice where does this leave the country like\nA week ago when a Senator Jeff flake made his extraordinary stand a stalling the nomination for a week in order to let the FBI investigate what he said was this is raping our country apart\nAnd that is really how it has felt at ... the whole episode has been sort of an ice pick into our nations rise wound if that's not to grow to be an analogy\nI you saw it you know I think people were already angry but the outpouring of anger that you saw over this nomination triggered by the nomination I think signifies just how unsettled a lot of these questions are and how emotional they are for so many people as you said on on on boats\nChicken literally ... particularly women I\nEnd up on the on the right you know you had Republicans who might have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans were on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish\nAnd this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the president\nYet the midterm elections are less than a month away and President Trump has this a victory to brag about along with the lowest unemployment numbers and fifty years of for weeks we've been hearing a predictions of a blue wave but our polling shows that the gap is closing is the wind up the president's back now and the Republicans\nDo I think I have no idea frankly [laughter]\nIt's close to an election it's it's hard to tell what signal and what his noise whether you're talking about polling are just sort of the national sentiment all the signs have been pointing in the direction of a very strong year for the Democrats you do have Republicans seeing this as a potential\nA last minute surge for them but it is still a month away and that is frankly still a lot of time for things to move around\nI ... and the trajectory is still rather remarkably as you said at the statistics are very good for the party in power usually a president with this kind of economic strength\nIs pulling quite high and yet the president is quite unpopular and that has rubbed off on the Republican Party and we have seen Republicans are really struggling to regain the upper hand and uh and do well in his life\nYeah that's the thing though right because um this is a great week

it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but just as soon as Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan we're at Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial and neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we left that\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep her relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term\nSometimes it can of ah avoid getting sucked into very big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether\nThe employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers gay

my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussion they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was a relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate treat you as was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you were of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought intense racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that different what what is it challenges you faced because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents\nFirst of all I
