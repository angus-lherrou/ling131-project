accusations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh fellow Republicans reluctantly agreed that the delay\nInhale the FBI secret report as an exoneration Democrats called the investigation incomplete

fight against the nominee\nNo matter a pivotal vote by Senator Flake turned the tide he announced that barring some major new development he'll vote to confirm Kavanaugh today\nSo we'll Senator Susan Collins of Maine she took to the Senate floor for more than forty minutes to explain why she'll vote for him even though she found Christian gloves before debate believable\nI Believe that she says her by her other ... and that term has ended her last name the last four when they name\nCould not corroborate any\nOf the fence that evening gathering where he says the U.S all a car\nI Believe north

there haven't been any doubt but the today's vote is a done deal\nHave been a lot of twists in the story so I'm not going to say anything is a hundred percent certain but yes we know that Brett Kavanaugh has the votes to be such a confirmed to the Supreme Court today we had been tracking for key undecided senators all along\nAnd yesterday three of them said they would in the end vote for Kavanaugh that's Jeff Flake Susan Collins and Joe Manchin who's the only Democrats supporting him Lisa Murkowski ended up being the loan reports\nA contentious you are in the rooms where it happened

Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court today this despite what we can imagine to be the objections of his fellow Democratic senators and what we know to be some very vocal objections of protesters who gathered at the Capitol\nTaylor Wilson is one of those protesters results way west Virginian and founder of the women's activist\nGroups boss babes in that state because rules and thanks so much for being with us\nThanks for having me\nAnd what your immediate reaction to senator Manchin Cheney intends to vote for drove to [noise]\nAh it's devastating but it's honestly not super surprising\nYeah well yeah it's been indicated false or what I mean Donald Trump got sixty eight point five percent of the presidential vote in West Virginia in twenty sixteen can the argument being made the senator mentioned is just reflecting the Democratic we'll express for other people of West Virginia [noise]\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that cabin uh people mostly most people at the party Kavanaugh here however um [noise]\nI think he did it entirely politically because he's up for reelection and thirty days and he he has under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah well but when you choose a politician to being a politician ... that's not much of a surprise visits I mean he's running for reelection for\nThe ap course and I did I say him yesterday on\nThursday we'll tell tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we did so we had a group of women who sat in his office like my dad and they were actually arrested a hit about nine women arrested they sat there for hours listening to him they had a conference call with him on Monday\nThat didn't really go out on Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on a two separate occasions the first one we had probably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we told\nOf sexual assault and ask them how they plan to vote and he said our way he he was very engaged\nReceived with respect\nAbsolutely yeah he was extremely engaged she has got a question um I Do believe that Joe Manchin cares for West Virginia I just don't think that's reflected in this decision [noise]\nDoes your probably continue if a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers ripped into\nOur fight does continue so uh as far as the Senate go eat it he kind of knew that he had us he kind of had it because at the other options Patrick Morrisey has done terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big\nProponent of the opioid crisis that and so he kinda surely doesn't believe in opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical in West Virginia I he's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and that he's just a bad guy and I think he knows that\nThey're they're dissolve camp this is all your opinion with me underscore is my\n... of course this is my opinion yes of course um [noise] so yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well as well and I are like that and to me or yeah\nSo we're working on and we're working at a state wide to change things we've got a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban abortion and Joe Manchin that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell if it's your Jones is if you have accepted senator mansions vote for what it is and I'm Still support among a great many issues and I've got to tell you this this sounds very civilized and democratic to me\nAnd I'm trying to play the long game I reluctantly as support has because I think the I think Morsi's worst choice mansion does still support us on the A. C. A. and tax reform so badly we still have to go with them and hopefully get somebody else a twenty twenty four\nTaylor Wilson of West Virginia thanks so much think yeah\nThe protest on Capitol Hill coming years since the advent of the me too movement\nStarted with Harvey one's done many actresses models employees and others who said that he had sexually harassed or assaulted the allegations first reported by the New York times and the New Yorker women in Hollywood were quick to take up the cause she was Oprah Winfrey at this year's Golden Globes\nTo say again [noise] NPR's\nElizabeth Blair takes a look at the impact of me to a year later\nDunbar high school in Washington DC psychology teachers terrorists while I watch students to consider some of the questions raised by the me too movement like consent should we be looking for the verbal ...

when he started to the U.S\nFrom one World Trade center in Manhattan is\nThe New Yorker radio our coal production of WNYC studio and the New Yorker\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick if you watch the video of two protesters with Senator Jeff flake in an elevator during the Kavanaugh hearings if you saw them confronting with so much anger at the way women have been treated for so long\nThe way they said to a U.S senator don't look away from me look at me and tell me it doesn't matter if you look at the way flake changed its position afterwards it's all becoming clear that something absolutely remarkable is taking place in America right now this is very much the subject of Rebecca Traister is a new book\nGood in mad revolutionary power of women's anger the book combines a kind of history of women's uprisings with an analysis of the me too movement\nTraister it's written from New York magazine el the New York times in the Washington Post\nAnd her last book was called all the single ladies unmarried women and the rise of an independent nation Rebecca Traister and I spoke on the very day that Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh both testified about her sexual assault allegations\nRebecca there's no way to avoid this we are talking now just hours after the Senate Judiciary committee has\nDone its questioning ... there was a very specific story being told by professor Ford as well as as mere is and and others in a very particular meal you as well what did the specifics tally the specifics of\nStory yeah well we are getting a very full and detailed view\nOf cultures around wealth white fundamentally\nPatriarchal power centers that begin in you know when people are teenagers the prep school to the you know Deborah Ramirez and story which was about how she was an outsider to this very elite um friday\nSocial circle of extremely wealthy privileged white men who were all on paths toward immense power\nAnd the narrative of it was when I was young in a responsible I was young in a responsible boys will be boys\nRight who who amongst us has not write like that and that's it again that's about the sort of invisibility of certain kinds of a power abuses um I write about in the book and something that I've I've become kind of obsessed with it and thinking both about how\nFor example a black lives matter movement has been talked about in the mainstream press and then watching the same kinds of things around the me too movement\nIt's helped me to understand a little bit about how when power is abused in the direction that is sort of natural the more powerful do something bad or harmful or even violent to the less powerful\nIt sort of invisible right oh oh he was a drunk boy of course he did this like what young man what Seventeen year old healthy young man with a sex drive in a keg like wouldn't have an behave that way it's like an discernible as harm in some way\nIn your book good mad you write very early in the book I Am a white woman who's been angry in my life and my work occasionally on my own behalf but more often about politics about inequity and the grotesque unfairness of the world in this country how it was built and who would still excludes\nAnd systematically diminished and then you're off to the races [laughter]\nUm this book is in large measure about anger the legitimacy of anger the climb into Bangor historically toward toward good\nUm [noise] what's that you often [noise]\nUm it was an attempt to get my thoughts clear after the election I was um does take some doing oh God yeah [noise]\nI didn't know I was I was wrestling with what my job was I was wrestling with what my work was how do you mean\nI was very muddy about what the story was that I needed to tell I have to say that I haven't I haven't talked about this before and um there's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of the white women\nI was acutely aware of my identity\nUm as a white woman the the degree to which my work has been blink or by my white miss my work on feminism the degree to which I have been pushed to be better to think more clearly about race and class um that's been a big part of my\nJust with a bunch of women and one of them had said\nAbout the white young white men who was the classic Bernie supporter like she had said something like\nWhere are you guys out there trying to to persuade people to vote for Hillary because it's your guys as white men who are not voting for her where the left white guys go get your boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise to me that white women had voted for Donald Trump\nBut I was acutely aware of this demographic and I felt some responsibility and I'm very sympathetic to the argument\nWhich is like leave 'em beat it is not worth the investment and trying to persuade white women to be on our side there's a woman in my book just morale up through says she worked on the Hillary campaign and she was like look this was about persuading white women do not be Phyllis Schlafly and that has never ever worked there are always going to be foolish off right I understand and have sympathy you\nWith that like just let 'em right right and they want to they want to support a system that fundamentally oppressive them and that oppressive other people great but I felt some that that phrase go get your boys\nWithout going in my own head and I think that I part of what I wanted to do with also think about white women and what impulses and messages are at work on white women\nAnd um I felt like it was my responsibility to examine race from the perspective of of waiting is in conjunction with looking at gender and then the anger so I I was feeling that but I wasn't sure how to do it right I I and that was the question about my work how do I do that what do I do what is my job what's ... what's the story here\nBut everything was so clouded [noise]\nAnd it was on a walk with my husband um between Christmas and New Years of that year says twenty six you know twenty Seventeen and I was trying to explain to him that despair I was feeling about not knowing what my role was supposed to be what it was what was my work going to be professional professionally\nAnd um I said I just can't think straight drives I'm I'm so mad and he was like well maybe that's what your kids\nAnd I said what do you mean and he goes well maybe that's what you need to write about is anger and as soon as he said it he's not a writer um he was just something he was responding to and what\nBut suddenly in that in that exchange I'm not exaggerating when I said it was the first feeling of like clarity and lightness in my head that I'd had at that point and two months it is interesting that the a lot of the exemplar of\nTo some Florence Kennedy who I remember well watching on public access television for hours I'm In her great half of Rosa Parks and in and of course the the mother of Emmett Till that's not by any coincidence that's not how this went by accident\nNo not at all women of color have often been\nNot only the leading activists organizers and the the people who who first gay voice in forum to a lot of the transformative social and political movements that have that have reshaped America\nUm they also often have done the thinking I mean ... poly Murray who somebody I write about in this book Polly Maria was credited\nBy both Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the intellectual works she did laying out the framework for racial and gender inequity in this country and and laying the groundwork for the laws that would ultimately wind up\nI'm protecting and are trying to ameliorate the kind of gender and racial inequality that she was she was trying to address she's still very rarely credited as this leader um\nAnd Florence Kennedy I haven't heard the name Florence Kennedy ... years I mean she's very much of the generation of Gloria Steinem or little even if she wins or speaking she and she and Gloria Steinem we're speaking partners caught on the road right to tell us a little bit about or it's kind of so Florence\nKennedy was a ... a black feminist lawyer um she was outrageous\nFor her time but I think she would be outrageous now I like stuff in her demeanor and her willingness to\nBe vocally pro family unapologetically enjoy fully pissed off about everything she was pissed off [laughter] and there was a lot of it she was mad about racism she was mad about sexism and she wasn't going to play nice at all\nSo you wrote a book about a time when you were you're working in a male dominated office uh-huh and you found yourself in tears you're angry and you're crying until you write a chili hard asked manager those are in quote a woman\nI'm In that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah another one\nI'll talk to buy is about protest songs then and now another winner next week on the New York or anywhere else in other words\n\nYou're listening to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick today it's part two of our story the long distance con\nAll right I hear your New Yorker
