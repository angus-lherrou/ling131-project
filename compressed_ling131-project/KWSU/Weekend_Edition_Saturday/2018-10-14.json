is a common\nSense [noise] people who are lucky to have them or using gas powered generator until utility crews to solve a downfall and wires and before their electricity [noise] say county emergency services chief mark Bowen\nAnd that will be a long slog\nThis electrical system was taken down to nothing I mean Ninety nine percent of its in the air and everything\nParents and that the editor and electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to do respiration that is pick up the wires resets the polls and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most that they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills\nAbout one in ten that data except to twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that damage is difficult\nJulie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\nOnce alliance and you're right it can actually be much more we can't take a long time after time ... and an overhead wire\n... flood prone areas that can make more sense to elevate grid infrastructure\nShe says already there's a lot of work and planning being done around the country to make grades more resilient one thing McNamara would like to see more of is independent micro grids with solar power and batteries that places like water treatment plant hospitals and facilities where residents can't easily evacuate\nSo we ought to be the sting

Floridian and a Key West injured or not just over a year ago you've seen a lot of storms come through what are you thinking about Michael and the level of destruction caused\nI think Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast and I remember the city of wave wind in Mississippi\nLooked a lot like Mexico beach looks now there were just homes wiped clean from their slabs and then all\nOf the associated destructive miss that kind of turns a wants to kind of lush area into a desert just stripped clean wiped clean of\nAny sign of or many signs of human habitation and construction no trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of a an unstoppable force\nLet's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson\nAnd a charismatic ... of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat Andrew Gillum is running for governor against Ron DeSantis a former congressman who also has a lot of support and pockets of Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott a Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here after\nScott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and then it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally rich got was running ads\nTouting his leadership during hurricanes so he has been kind of all over ah both physically and these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been\nIn Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush and Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it would appear so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is an executive albeit of\nTallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right in\nThe or the county ... county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power last and coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent run the Centers for his leadership during a\nStorm hurricane her me this time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seeing a visibly in in one case actually change showing trees away [laughter] and\nMoving debris really show he's changed your trees he's making\nSure Gillum is that he's not perceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone's trying to capitalize on the on the media moment in and trying to be seen doing the best for Floridians in it and I got that remains to be seen a what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be polls that are going to be looking

in Panama City and the surrounding towns I mean tell me what you're saying\nWell it feels like the relief effort really is getting underway now at least in and around Panama City it took a few long days after the storm for the official response to sort of get off the ground\nBut I really saw difference on Saturday there were multiple locations in Panama City and other towns where emergency officials are handing out food and water like we just heard of the top but that said there is a huge need for basic supplies and not just on the coast storm did a lot of damage in small dirt road towns forty and fifty miles inland\nAnd there are very long lines for supplies all over the region lots of people need help\nYeah and the pictures of devastation or are incredible how much does it still without electricity right any any sense when it's coming back\nYeah there are still tens of thousands of people without power the local utility Gulf Power estimates it's going to restore electricity to most of the region by the end of the week\nBut that estimate does not include some of the hardest hit areas right around Panama City which might be without power for weeks I Would say maybe months just driving around in Panama City I mean it's unbelievable the number of electrical poles that are down you see power lines in the street everywhere you can't really drive without driving over them\nAnd at the same time there is no water not many gas stations are open the ones that do have gas have really long lines so I think things are going to be pretty rough year for the

were really big problems also with communications or is that getting any better\nOr not that I've seen I must sell carriers are still down in around Panama City I mean many even emergency officials don't have phones that work [noise] um so you know it's a big problem people can call their relatives to say they're okay um and and it's I think has to be one of the things that's really slowing down

it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for\nThem what states are you watching heading into this last month that the campaign I mean where they're really tight races\nSome a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida is always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American American\nSo that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Stanton if it's going to be I think are really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams will be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's the state there is changing and that changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a hamster surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss up but then Democrats have real chance to flip them places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that sort of a mixture of things you have really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on a state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally he only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and terrorists is playing an important role in places like Iowa to heal where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising and notable for Republicans and how many of their incumbent and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection they could flip estate in Connecticut where there's an outgoing\nI'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New

now\nAcross the entire region the damage from wind and flooding is expensive that Scott errands and at the Edison electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to do respiration that is pick up the wires reset the polls and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most that they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills\nAbout one in ten that data up to twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says is a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that down\nOnce in a line of ... that it can actually be much more cost me and take longer amount of time to act and an overhead

of the state in different media markets and he's been\nIn Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott as governor Jeb

a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is the executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee mayor\nBut it was hit pretty hard\nIt was hit yeah a ... Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right in the ... the county of Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power loss and coincidentally just before\nThe hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent run the census for his leadership during a storm hurricane her mean this time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seeing a visibly in in one case actually change sewing trees away [laughter] and\nI'm moving debris really so he's changed trees [laughter] well he's he's making\nSure Gillum is that he is not perceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone's trying to capitalize on the on the media moment in and trying to be seen doing the best from Floridians in it and I got that remains to be seen or what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nOh sure we just have to wait until they go back in the field again understand that like the entire panhandle is going to be almost impossible poll right now because you can't get a hold of a half you know\nSome of the people that's\nBig win on the Supreme Court Republicans and conservatives seemed to be at the height of their political power but will that change after November tune in to MORNING EDITION to hear what's at stake for the GOP and their majorities in Congress you could listen by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your member station by name [noise]\n\nShears the chain of department stores has been a part of American culture for a hundred and twenty five years the commercials from my childhood Senegal\nKmart [noise] [laughter]\n\nI won't be able to get that out of my head now but the auto center hardware appliance and clothing store is approaching\nThe end of its long slow decline Sears Holdings the company that owns the years and I should say Kmart needs to pay back a hundred and thirty four million dollars of debt by tomorrow or face bankrupting Jay Hancock is this year span and historian a joins us now thanks for being on the program\nNo problem thanks for having me how are you feeling about this moment as I said here's it's been struggling for a while but tomorrow's deadline looks serious and reports are that it's big lenders are pushing for liquidation\nYeah it's um it's sort of sad really a Sears is an American institution you know I was listening to the commercial you were just playing and it brought back memories for me as well I mean I think that's really a big part of the staying power is it it's sort of missed outlook you know for older generations\nI mean I grew up in the seventies and she was still you know a gargantuan at that point a lot of people would say that that was sort of their pinnacle a the sixties and seventies the post World War two era\nAt nine on the NPR News service of northwest public broadcasting and if you're tuned into the NPR in classical music service you can listen to classical guitar live from nine to ten am [noise]\nA tiger in India is thought to be responsible for the deaths of several people and it's so hard to search efforts for the tiger going you'll hear about that story at eight forty six men\nWomen it's eight forty one I mean for super I Hope you're having a great Sunday happy to have you here [noise]\nIn an effort to limit foreign hackers some states may deter voters to read that story visit our website at an W ... or [noise]\nIf you ever have any questions or comments about the programs do you hear on the service we love to hear from you please send your email to info I.
