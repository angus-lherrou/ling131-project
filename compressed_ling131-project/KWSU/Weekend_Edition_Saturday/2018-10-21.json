just seems like almost like our ministry ... trip in his regime is working\nHand in hand with the Saudi Government to take a very serious situation and tried to dismiss it\nWhat should the response the what should that powerful message the\nWell the message to start by saying this story is completely unacceptable it's full of every kind of a whole lot given it any sort of of credibility and that we have to get to the bottom of everything that that happened\nSecond is we need to realize that this is this is one piece of a broader set of issues we have to address a prior to the incident in the

I Try and keep up and all that kind of [noise]\nI Would have to agree to during that so it's a it's a big asking this amount of time reading\nThat the b._b._c. Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\nFor\nIn a little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests\nThere's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns and that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me\nAll right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state well\nIt is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops of President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person\nDoesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat\nMight have to they're just gonna maybe both just on the party line as opposed to the individual\nCandidates state legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national wave than seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two state to really important in twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan then they are there we go\nBumps into a particularly bad pothole [noise] and if the situation would reverse would Republicans hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie\nAnd the state house but if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in a state that soon as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah\nThe taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about uh how the Democratic tax increases have traced a lot of uh uh Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic runs states the taxes are simply too high\nThere's something pivotal at stake here though on other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors\nThat will happen before the twenty twenty two elections Democrats were caught on the short side\nOr after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nRead Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the news of Richard Nixon's Saturday

Navarro\nHead of the mid term elections we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view of\nThe way politicians expressed or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after Hispanic nickname his rival ... works has long used\nFor\nHimself hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nPut your name is Raphael you know you go by Ted that's an angle sized version of it he went the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for claiming native heritage manage to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA test\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized visit we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nUse identity sometimes in a in a very good way to use either for example use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but I think that we can over your side of the day that we can\nBring identities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them and were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody one of those identities is misleading uh best\nStill matters in the world whether in her man or woman or black or white and so on but I think we can take 'em to seriously other many political complex I'm the most important thing in that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them as they should be able to get their kids\nFor that message very the candidate best the one on the grounds so you have to balance it out\n[noise] the rules of identity in politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or cooking\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should onto your question directly gingerly constantly [laughter] I I think you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way\nAnd not laid down a terrible road because once you've created as a racial division\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know all sorts of twenty century they're drawing people together or through making them feel ashamed hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is a political identities right now\nThe labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal feelings and a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one of my identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means you lose the sense that you know action reserved and then whoever wins or when you sort of gather behind in order to should run the country\nCan send to you I mean I'm hearing a real concern that identity I'm On the politics around it has been weaponized and it certainly\nI think I think it is learning I mean look the fact is you know our country is is that where more divided around identities then we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come to reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things or immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because of the people who are most engaged in politics I think that every confession it's not coming together but losing\nLosing to the other side\nAnd in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to a certain identity because it it's about making sure that your basic satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're part of a common taught [noise]\nYeah now the question is whether you could do that without it\nFor example more about the actual owner democracy and things like for compromise term everything into an identity as we make a very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is polite that bind me thinking identity thank you very much\nLike your very much America's Test kitchen is celebrated as a reliable source of advice for home cooks they

Afghanistan they were twenty five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats I'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years\nAnd the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul dozens are dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is a reporter Jennifer class she is in Kabul thanks for being with us get to be here and and so when people\nAre able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence keep them away you know despite the threat from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people lined up waiting ... certainly some people\nWhere people are most at threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack with a suicide bomber here in Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by a policeman he detonated his\nExplosive vests outside or in the north there was shelling and couldn't do we know that they burned down one polling center outside bit of ... city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the outskirts of Kabul\nI brought his armed men in he's a candidate and he tried to prevent\nOther people from getting to the polling stations so not by far the cleanest elections the Afghan governance announced its arrested a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs so this time around is the number of women running right over four hundred what will just mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said LOU LOU there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many almost a symbol of the corruption and patronage that\nHas held Afghanistan back and it was really interesting to see election observers\nAt the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghan trying to change things and just\nBriefly what does it signified at the vote was held after so very long it's always important to remind people that this is a country and conflict to conflict that the United states is involved in it is and there was a\nLot of controversy about whether the votes should be held at all but Afghan officials were adamant and international officials were adamant that they were going for with the vote and I think today they might be happy with their decision more than three million of eight point eight million registered voters coming out there trying to show that the that Afghanistan is making progress\nAnd the battle insurgents around the country the Taliban are resurgent Islamic state was against the vote and yet still Afghans came out to exercise their civil\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station

civil society\n[laughter] you're trying to figure out Turkey's well here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information I it's also a major player in the middle east an American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information\nReally to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they treated very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have you know forty thousand people in prisons or many of them are are journalists as well and activist and others and so there clearly not the beacon of liberal democracy and the region\nBut they've been able to play this role of of basically defending a you know uh this one man Joe Biden and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated jet\nOr they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange they need him less meant they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther eyes or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the ins or to what it was very clear about that and so it really depends on now countries with with\nSaudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult [noise] uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to hold sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on the runway and Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was the best and among many a political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nThank you\nOn September twenty six twenty fourteen students from a teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we're presumed killed in and around the town of water\nAlthough there remains have never been found their deaths were very nicely blamed on corrupt local political and\nPolice officials as well as higher ups and the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been hadn't and this has published an exhaustive look into the events of that and I had her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the event was a fabrication\nIn these official version the Mexican government said that the army and police they didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything ends species that we should start eat what I had seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official ... is our ally is not to its ally\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the for the police not Joss Whedon not about what was happening that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the ... not just these\nEven more I had reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if it up on his way chasing the student scenes they laughed at school I mean see I was before that that [noise]\n[noise] well that students arrive\nNear while they're the army the police they state police were waiting for them than their students decide to move that two bosses where they were transferred dating insight to the CD\n[noise] to be able to take the more versus mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to the protest to Mexico City so they went to both the station\nDay to do that you both us and Clinton their students were trying to Cape ... be spy bosses\nFrom the ... when the army the police\nThen when you see by police and the staple east is that to shoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm they they're always at the end of that back way to process it from these two buses disappeared all their forty three students [noise]\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses I'm to the people that were on those buses the students are on this bus has disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese last I think the most difficult part of my investigation I'm In the students were traveling inside bus that's\nWhy that's a good one just to\nFill these two versus what exactly that to Boston is that the army and they said that police start to monitor it\nSeems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses would they do both states where the students were traveling from their school to why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know\nThe students the best known for the army and the fact that I Believe they knew it so these students\nAlmost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't\nHow do you know that heroin was hitting on that bus [noise]\nI was able to connect with one drug lord important drugs locked I was able to contact with one person that works for him and glass these uh informant and inside the cocktail that explained me days [laughter] [noise]\nDo we know who ordered the crime I mean there's been over a hundred arrests in this case do we know who actually said you know targeted these students in order to this to happen according with my investigation that there's a responsible of these crime wise that twenty seven battalion anyone\nIn particular decorum and dodge received a phone call from that there'll be ... or their ... you have to rescue my drugs I pay you for the you have to I don't know I don't why do you have to do I want my drugs back\nHave they've faced any

me\nWell the message to start by saying this story as completely unacceptable it's full of every kind of a whole lot given it any sort of of credibility and that we have to get to the bottom of everything that that happened\nSecond is we need to realize that this is this is one piece of a broader set of issues we have to address a prior to the incident in the consulate the Saudis were using

Charlotte Gallagher in London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome for having me\nAll right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state well\nIt is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats\nAnd that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with\nBut if there was some kind of blue wave that develops as President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican tickets it's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be slim those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run\nThat say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have\nSo they're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidates\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states are really important at twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving this race is\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix their car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if the situation would reverse would Republicans the hammering the famous you\nYeah I I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent that money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip and one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate\nWhich is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house but if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that sitting as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national times just can overwhelm everything yeah\nThe taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have changed a lot of uh uh Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic run the states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though on other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course the state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors\nThat will happen before the twenty twenty two elections Democrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election of big wave for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs in a lot of the states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships\nThere'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here if the elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nRead Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nSaturday Night massacre President Nixon had ended the Justice Department having let go of his attorney

really affect how often they have attacked\nAnd how bad they are reporter Alan you has been looking into this hey Alan and I can so what do people say about climate change so\nInterestingly when you ask people with asthma ... climate change is not top of their mind they're more concerned with things that they can see in this field right now\nAll kinds of trucks rolling through to get a bowl of I

hospitalization\n... is medical director and founder of the community ask for prevention program at the children's hospital of Philadelphia\nAnd I say the increases airway information that increased as an asthma attack\nSo what is the exact connection here how climate change going to make asthma worse than it already is\nOkay climate change your one on one burning fossil fuels like oil coal and

plants grow faster and research shows the plants like rag weed and pine trees could release pollen suing them and release more off it leading to a longer pollen season\nAnd more pollen is of course the bad news for people with asthma or allergies and when I think\nAbout asthma and the condition Allen there are already a bunch of factors that are really out of the control of individual people write it gets worse\nAnd look at factors in I environment or in people's neighborhoods that is looking to kill the at one of the family I met Angela ... she has two sons both of them have asked them
