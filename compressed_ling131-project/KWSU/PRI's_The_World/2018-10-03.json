flashing this text message presidential alert this is a test of a national wireless emergency alert system no action is needed\nAlmost all Americans saw that on their cell phones today it was a test by FEMA the federal emergency management agency for a system that the president could use in case of a national emergency got us thinking about how other countries do this sort of thing and the world's Lydia amen Alito looked into that\nOr is this something governments do is this normal around the world\nYeah it's it's an they many governments do around the world I they use these systems for I mentioned to announcements everything from natural disasters too missile warnings\nAnd I gather Lydia here in the U.S there have been a quite a few privacy concerns about how the government's going to use the system\nYeah that's right there was actually a federal lawsuit was filed last week by the people they want it to block that Chapman station from sending today's alert uh they said they worried that eventually the system will turn into a quote government control loud speaker in the home that every person\nA FEMA has said though that the system will only be used in the case of

two thousand eleven when a big earthquake was about to hit Japan people got this alert on their cell phone [noise]\n\n\nAnd one more example I Want to mention is France because earlier this year they announced a plan to start doing some to start doing some of this warning through social media are so that means that when you log on social media there's a national emergency going on that warning shows up at the very top of your feet so it's very visible\nBut at the same time France like many other countries I looked into still hold on to some of the more old school methods for warning

was introduced it currently Seventy\nI mean they're more than fifty countries in the commonwealth which are influenced by the English model from India to your own native South Africa and they all evolved in the same direction of ending lifetime tenure\nI guess they have so there are exceptions but there are three smoke or civic island states where judges are typically brought in on a contract basis or for this discussion when we're talking about logic countries we can leave them to one side so it's\nStriking that there's no more lifetime appointment in that group of upcoming little
