column and the economy is so big question David here is this a new Cold War with China\nIt doesn't have to be on China is extremely key ... that it should not they don't even wants to trade war and they are pretty desperate to avoid one end to work out what America wants\nBought it used to be just a few hardliners here in Beijing who saw that America actually couldn't be negotiating with the America wanted to contain China and still China's rise that fringe\nOf hardliners is now spreading an awful lot of Chinese leaders look at the speech by vice president Mike Pence attacking China for a a kind of laundry list to complaints they look at how Donald Trump isn't really engaging\nWhen it comes to winding down this potential trade war and they're starting to wonder whether that was fear\nMight actually be what's happening to them which is that just they were poised to become a kind of great super part of the top of his of economic toy simple America in its last kind of\nDying vengeance is a kind of aging heck I'm On has decided to try and stop them and so that is the that is the question that Beijing leaders are asking and they absolutely will not looking for this fight right now that busy trying to become rich and powerful than others has come out of out of the blew up and\nWell the Trans Pacific partnership or TPP that was supposed to give us some leverage with some of the those issues like intellectual property rights but Trump pulled out of it\nThat's right I mean I was a there was a ... a retired very senior American officials in Beijing last week and it was all of the records like on sort of naming but he was a kind of household name in this day and he comes to try and a lot for business or an stokes the Chinese they take advice from him\nAnd he had a small dinner for a group of us in Beijing we're discussing what Donald Trump wants on you know I was discussing having into the Trump the times about China when I stood in DC I kind of put it to him and he was kind of uncomfortable but then said that maybe there was some\nDomestic structural things but it wants China to do differently to play by the rules to try and fix the world trade older as you say mark ... to you know to what with something like the ... everyone opens their markets that bull\nDonald Trump I don't think is a systems kind of guy I think he has a number of very powerful very instinctive ideas and I think if\nYou look at what he's been saying about China on trade it's almost as if you know he's a real estate guy and he thinks of the American market the American economy as a fantastically valuable piece of real estate and that previous presidents and America's administrations\nWere too dumb and to kind of kindly to charge enough rent to the rest of the world ... access to that market and so it's like you know Donald Trump's back in his real estate days he says he he he owns a valuable properties this time it's called the United states\nAnd it's time to review the rent and it's not very pleasant for the guy on the other side of the table but there isn't gonna biggest structural kind of vision of how to run the world trading odor it's just it's time you pay a lot more rent I I think that's the quote unquote on Trump is up to right now\nWhat is China's vision for the world so he's a really interesting saying the Chinese joined the world Trade Organization Seventeen years ago and have basically been gaming the system ever since uh China\nChina is very interesting world power because China has an incredibly clear vision of where it wants to end up it has a very clear and gold and you know probably that's to be one of the world's most powerful to countries and so powerful that no one else gets to say no to them\nDoes go how'd they get that is not actually so important that quite opportunistic if one policy looks pluck they'll try another if there's too much pushback then they'll be nice for but\nThat's very very kind of cross through by feeding the the Chinese kind of fries and\nFor a long time they gave me the world trading system and and that was how they liked it well it's really interesting about this last few months several trade tensions and you've got this when you talk to the European government leaders have been talking to the Chinese visiting Beijing it turns out that the one thing\nThat the Chinese dislike more American led world trading order is no rules a tool and so suddenly the Chinese are being undermined the rules gave me the rules playing the system so I think they realize that the one thing they don't want to do is to lose the system completely so suddenly the Chinese are\nQuite in the winter of reforming the WTO another local kind of changing so much so the result is kind of this\nProblem is that you can also see some very negative kind of forces could feed off each other and we could go the wrong direction or an absolutely confident that the Chinese don't actually know how to play this ... because\nReasonably senior Chinese officials are now working their way down to lift the people who can explain what comes to the nickel ... down the list there are people like me and I literally have conversations with what I say\nI'm a reporter it's not my job to tell you you know how to handle the Americans but they're all skiing everyone is this trade more avoidable\nGraham Allison over at Harvard coined the phrase the few cities trap tell us what that is and how the Chinese yet\nShe says this was an ancient Greek historian who wrote about when you had a very militaristic rising power sponsor coming up against a social status quo ... Athens it ended up inevitably lead you to war and so he then analyzed a number of occasions I have a human history where\nThe status quo power finds itself being challenged by an upstart and in a depressing number of cases that does trigger armed conflict I mean you could be an optimist in say the Chinese are busy trying to get rich\nThat trying to become more powerful they are absolutely no looking to solve the Cold War they don't have time for this they don't have time even for a trade war that led to shooting pool so they're just not going to stop this thing um and actually I didn't think told Trump is a particularly militaristic\nMan I mean he's the kind of the guy who got any number of photons from Vietnam I think he's not physically a kind of war like person he's kind of ... year old self time they'd cut of New York real estate guy [noise]\nUm so I think as people age to go to war but the dynamics can get a bit of weight from youth when you've got these two big big countries that no longer think that they are\nConfined win win solutions you know this does feel weird leaves zero some doubt it feels as though the American charges that China's rise is at America's expense\nAnd that this is kind of wind before trying to get so big that it's too late to stop it it's it's a window to try and bend the cup and there's this extraordinary things on the Trump said I think it was the U.N General assembly speech when he said the previous presidents such that have\nBeen ready to watch trying to rise to become the world's most powerful country and the on his watch that wasn't going to happen quite so soon that is really extraordinary statement you know previous American presidents said you know if you're going to rise let's make sure you rise\nIn the right way you're going to rise as a responsible stakeholder remember that phrase that people used to use about China that it was going to become a kind of uh\nSay at least to the piece of rhetoric you just look at a garage and the way that you don't you're going to I'm going to stop it that that is an incredibly bleak thing for Beijing to hit\nDavid Rennie of the economist speaking with us from Beijing thank you pleasure [noise] news headlines are coming up and about sixty seconds so this is the world and the world dot O.
