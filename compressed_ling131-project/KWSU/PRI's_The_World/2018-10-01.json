W. P. B. dot org and on northwest public television\nHi Margot where men and you're with the world our next story is not strictly speaking about science but it is about how the science behind Google Earth and satellite imagery helped advance the investigation into an atrocity\nTo hear some graphic details in this story the story begins as I said\nWith an atrocity this is a moment from a video that went viral this summer and it's a killing is about to take place soldiers are walking to prisoners down the road you can just about here one of the soldiers whistling Conrad is filming and commenting on a lot\nYou know reduce\nThe prisoners are two women plus a young child and a baby [noise]\n\nTwenty two shots were fired in all the women and the children were killed\nBut it was unclear who was shooting or where this happened at first glance a guess might be that it's somewhere in Africa but that's about it then a team from the BBC's Africa I investigative unit went to work\nAnd thanks to science and technology they managed to zero in on not just where the killings happened but also the identity of the likely shooters those alleged shooter's are now in custody\nTell me a lot of people the b._b._c. African security correspondent joined us from Nairobi a really outstanding piece of investigative journalism Tommy what made you and the team I think you could actually practice case\n[noise] well I think first of all it was just that the shock that gripped everyone who saw\nThis video right from the beginning and it began you know just conversations across to each other with different research is reaching out and saying does anybody know whether this is so anybody have any idea\nWhat what this terrain um links to and that's how the conversation started and lots of people talking and then the b._b._c. picked up on that and became a full on the investigation\nI mean I guess the first challenge was to figure out what country this happened in them and getting more specific details about where in that country how did you figure out the location and what role did open source technology play in that\n[noise] well [noise] I mean there are parts of this whole collaboration festival looking at that that could be anywhere in the ... which is why it across west in Central Africa a botched\nWith many heads put together one of them was Amnesty International their rights group which had been researching northern Cameroon and about the military that and you know also when people when you listen to the video and you know looking at\nListening to some of the dialogue in it I'm an amnesty with their research as well they suggest that this was camera and this was northern capital of course that's also vast region but over\nOutlines of the mountains in the video and using those rich lines matching them to Google and digital globe and other imagery providers using geo location that's how you know this whole all moved on and and the location was matched\nI've found that part a little bit difficult to kind of understanding how you were able to know that that rich line match the contours of what you found on GPS I mean that's the only original I met has that shape and all of common room\nIt's painstaking work it's it's not something that was very easy but\nThey'll so many clueless put together so it's not just the rage line I could be any Richland but when you have one clue when you have another clear you sort of bring them together and that narrows the results you get so for example looking at different times for example when setting buildings existed was when they did not so going back in time and\nLooking at different elements of that an addict everything together so it's it's something that took\nQuite a bit of time and more than a dozen people working on it\n[noise] yeah and you also work with Ellen cat the open source research group which is seriously experience on this kind of stuff um how did you figure out who was responsible [noise] well\nFirst of all the government tried to deny initially that these ... soldiers they said you know or the uniform on was not watch\nUm the the soldiers would wear up north um they said the guns and not the ones issued to communion soldiers but we did identify some of the guns one of them as I stopped I Am Twenty one which is used by some divisions of the kind of Indian Army will serve on some of the the uniforms\nBoy indeed ... military uniforms and and so we were able to\nTo festival identify and found that those were communion soldiers but then in the dialogue as well some of the soldiers was saying each other's names one of them was was referred to as Churchill\nOr another one is called sign guy but around the same time before the b._b._c. investigation came out the camera and government actually arrested seven men seven soldiers so they changed their tone and said well they had the rest of the sudden people in in relation to this video\nAnd ... from the BBC's own investigation were able to match these names that were mentioned in the video to some of the ones that were arrested and some of those names when nicknames but on the on the official list they had the official name them so we could match that we can use Facebook as well to match some of those details\nOf your parents do you know you've found choked on Facebook right yes indeed\nBook you know we found a way to speak to a former communion soldier who also confirmed that this wasn't the Joe Joe so somebody who who knew him\nHave you been able to find out and the team been able to find out any possible motive for this violent crime to women to children including a baby\nAt the beginning of the of the video we see them are referring to to these uh women as Boko Haram so saying that they are members or at least affiliated with Boko Haram\nAnd there's a point where I Am I'm One of the soldiers sort of a tell this child that um you know sorry we have to do this kind of thing and and and\nUm basically saying it's it's the parents' fault that you are getting killed as well um so you know the soldiers are no forwarding these women and children any any access to to fat trial to a fair trial or they just you know execute what they consider justice on the spot\nYou know I guess we'll see how many crimes like this are are invisible what kind of feedback to this investigation has the b._b._c. Africa gotten from the public like from Cameroon and Niger itself [noise] the\nFeedback has been overwhelming and people of all walks of life from around the world responding to this and saying you know well done on the work but I think one thing that people are most fascinated by the method\nYou know the location that use of mathematical calculations calculating for example you know the angle of the sun and using that versus the length of a shadow and using that to tell what time when exactly this happened so those kinds of things have really I'm really fire up the audiences\nI'm so there's been a lot of praise for that and a lot of people hoping that mall can come out a cameraman and people in particular but I've been calling for more to be done to hold their their government and their forces accountable\n[noise] the video or you have to say is very disturbing how're you doing and the other is only investigative team\nUm it's it's not an easy video to what to watch um [noise] you know it's it's it's difficult to you know once you've seen at festivals even believe that that happened and and and the shock\nAnd it's something you can't really you race from your from your mind so uh it's not something easy to watch a but it doesn't necessarily job to to be done to when you have to expose these kinds of things I'm the last of atrocities around the world uh sometimes you have to go to the hard way uh to be able to\nShe's Africa's security correspondent thanks very much You're welcome [noise]\nNews headlines or next year on the world [noise]\n[noise]\nJust about one thirty right now on northwest Public Broadcasting's NPR News survey and coming up in just half a gallery fresh air in the meantime keep threatening the world continue isn't just a moment [noise]\nKnow the attention that they need and the access that they need to and so I think in a big facility will return to these big facilities like twenty others emergency facility we see that um you know there isn't the same provision for education um ... the kids you know we were told the kids get work books but that's not\nA education yet not far cry from classroom education and um in terms of any kinds of melt mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really ad hoc\nIt's really the onus has been on the child to to ask for it but you know they've just been transition there from a different facility they don't know anyone there disoriented\nPossibly upset about it and so I think it's really difficult in those situations coupled with being with thousands of kids you know hundreds of other kids um it's quite stable I think\nYou're a ... kind of boggles when you think about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean they have any legal help if they can access\n[noise] um well that's a great question so um you know it doesn't happen in every facility but you know by and large children at the permanent shelters are provided with an you know your rights presentation on they receive screening\nAnd so in some cases some of the children are able to get legal support through those avenues\nUm you know because the children are transferred from other facilities to turn into you know my understanding is that they're not receiving any more no you're right that tornado I'm at the time came facility and you know the access to legal services there has been very difficult so again it is concerning\nMeantime the administration and its supporters say the immigration system is broken and Congress needs to fix it um how do you respond to the\nShow I mean I think we have a system we have a a protection system in place a lot of these kids are seeking protection country we have that in place\nYou know could improve short I think what's really missing is investment in system there is a huge backlog of cases we need more immigration judges more support staff or those judges I mean I think we need to really invest in the process instead of saying oh the process doesn't work because it's so slow or older process\nDoesn't work for other reasons I think it's it's chronic lack of investing in a system\nWe we need to prioritize getting kids out of getting children out of detention it's just not appropriate for them it's just not a ... it's not a long term it's not a good solution we need to get kids out of detention and we need to continue to work on the immigration on excuse me on the immigration court system\n[noise] um or are you hopeful\nYou know the public is engaged on this issue I think I'm Congress has been very engaged and tissue on and you know\nDoing a lot of it certainly is a different shelters looking at this issue holistically from um a rival to the immigration courts and so I'm hopeful there's a lot of oversight on this right now but I'm obviously it's one thing to have that versus you know commitment to funding\nYou know and and hiring more judges and you know to really think children to appropriate and safe sponsor as soon as possible\n[noise] all your travel as an attorney with the women's refugee commission thank you for your time well thank you very much\nPresident Trump crackdown on immigration has taken many forms over the past year and nine months\nOne of the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is eligible for a visa or permanent residency\nThis change what essentially mean that anyone deemed to be at risk of becoming a public charge of the government by accessing government benefits like Medicaid or housing subsidies for example could be denied a visa or a green card\nAdvocates fear this could lead to families here in the U.S doing without benefits or even medical care for fear of putting their legal status in jeopardy laundry for Lucy says she's already seen that happening for Lucy's a pediatrician in Washington and a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics\nSo this proposed rule as a vast expansion of what can be used against an immigrant who was applying for a visa for permanent residency\nSo what it does really from my perspective as a pediatrician is that it presents\nAre immigrant families with an unfair choice to either keep yourself and your children healthy but risk being separated for using these services such as Medicaid or snap on so called food stamps or forego those models services that included healthcare Nutrition Assistance so your family can remain together in this country\nSo really this proposed rule is a dangerous threat to childhood family health\nSo the rule uh obviously still in the proposal phase but what chilling effect so are you already are seeing and hearing from families\nSo I've been seeing the chilling effect for months already with families deciding to different role from these vital services just in case it could be used against them in the future\nOf this includes even opting out of programs again like snap and even wake or the women infants and children program\nAnd four months parents have been asking as if it's safe for them to access these programs and it's tough because it's a very complex proposal their draft of which is nearly four hundred and fifty pages so parents are choosing to play it safe and remove them\nIf you couldn't tell us about a specific conversation you've had recently with a family or a parent who is facing the dilemma you're talking about\nSo I'd say the one of the many situations that troubled me in particular is that more and more I'm seeing new moms with newborns who are only a few days old choosing not to sign up for these services so as recently as last week I cared for baby who was only four days old and as with many new moms\nI'm the mom was motivated to breastfeed what was having a difficult time doing so she's also concerned that her family was not able to afford fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are vital especially for breastfeeding mom I'm so they usually do I talked about the\nMany benefits of federal programs that provide breastfeeding support or formula is needed or food assistance but she declined I'm\nAnd she said that she'd heard that it could jeopardize her family's chances of staying together here in the U.S [noise]\nSo so I worry about this baby and many babies in similar situations who are starting their lives without all of the support that they can get if their families were not being place in the situation of fear and uncertainty and that's one child I saw last week but so many others over the last several months that I've seen in that same situation\nSo families individuals are looking at the trade off between access to medical care and a pause and possibly limiting their chances of getting permanent legal status\nRight right so they're being forced to decide between either\nStability in the U.S with a new status or choosing their family's house which is really an impossible choice so the message that immigrant families are hearing is that they have to make that choice either health care and food or seeking permanent legal status in the United states\nRight and it's not just medical benefits that will be affected right I mean it's a whole range of other benefits that could ultimately of an effect on people's health\nRight exactly so with the the programs that are\nAffected include Medicaid so which which really is a lifeline for a lot of my family's they would not be able to afford the preventive care the specialty care and dental care that all kids need if they didn't have Medicaid and includes programs like snap or food stamps that\nProvides healthy foods\nAnd includes housing assistance 'em and other services that actually allows them\nDr Len rifle lose a pediatrician in Washington with the Children's National health system also a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics\nThank you very much for being with us
