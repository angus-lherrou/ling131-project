GBH has spent a year looking deeply at how all this has impacted people all around the world they're documentary the Facebook dilemma is airing on PBS this week\nWe want to focus on one country discussed in the documentary the Philippines where president Rodrigo Duterte day is accused of using a coordinated army of trolls to silence critics\nRedeemed any patriotic folding on line ... wanting to highland man can rebates this information just tons of democracy and where our lives are proud of one's life\nFrontlines James Jacoby worked on this investigation and joins us in the world studios thanks for coming by James thank you [noise] uh what is the place of Facebook in the lives of most Filipinos like how much of the population has access to it and how much do they interact with each other and via the up\nWell it's remarkable the story of Facebook and Southeast Asia it's amazing that they pushed aggressively into south east Asia and to Philippines and demand more other countries\nAnd they are essentially the ... facto Internet and a lot of those countries because they offer Facebook as part of a data plan where people don't actually have to\nUse the data in order to use it and the Philippines it's between Ninety and a hundred percent of the Internet users in the Philippines use Facebook as the Internet basically and Maria wrestler who who's a ... that the woman were interviewing in the film from the Philippines who runs a big news organization there she\nTalks about the fact that it's their public space it truly is their public space in the Philippines um in terms of their digital lives\nSo Maria wrestle we just heard from we'll hear more from her in a moment um we've reported on the store that uh occurred in Myanmar where fake news actually led to the violence headed Rodrigo Duterte day the Filipino president weaponize Facebook during the election campaign and twenty sixteen\nSo what happened is Facebook actually offered a lot of help to deter today a during his campaign for president and helped him to really harness the power of the platforms helped his campaign really understand how to use it effectively and as Maria wrestle reports\nAfter he was elected he essentially weaponized hit by turning all this campaign machinery all this\nPaid followers that we're disseminating all sorts of lies about his policies and also going after critics in a rather vicious hateful way um and in some cases are trying to incite violence against people [noise]\nSo uh on Maria ... a ... this activist I mean she worked for a prominent news website in the Philippines Rappler media and when she started noticing this problem she actually brought it to Facebook the tension in twenty sixteen as we learn in the dark here's an exchange between you James and ... so\nWere you given an explanation as to why they weren't acting\nNo [noise]\nI think baseball one game and they were focused on ... but they didn't realize is that\nCountries like China [noise] countries where ... they don't have any dogs [noise]\nWhat happens when you bring everyone onto a platform in July ... by any kind of rules don't infant for wine country chaos so\nJames what did Facebook tell you about the way they responded to the Philippines and to Maria rest of his complaints\nWell Facebook has set a number of things in response to it on one they said they were too slow and addressing the problems that Maria brought to them and it wasn't until Maria\nProduced and published a three part investigative series that exposed the fact that there were these accounts that were spreading hate speech and misinformation that Facebook actually took action on those accounts [noise]\nBut as she tells us the problem is ongoing interestingly recently and as a as I think it was an April Facebook is pain Maria wrap this organization to be a third party fact checker of things that are going viral on Facebook in the Philippines\nBut as she put it to us recently they're completely inundated\nAnd Facebook still doesn't really have handled the problem there does that suggest you know hiring her as a fact checker ... does that suggest Facebook is going to pursue and due diligence or they were just trying to plug the hole\nI think that that there are fact checking project that they're trying to do all around the world um is what they're seen as the first step toward a solution or at least containing the problem of hate speech and misinformation have\nPeople on the ground that are fact checking material in the home country uh\n... runs a news organization and she utilizing resources that would otherwise be put toward reporting and doing fact checking riots going viral on Facebook yeah [noise]\nUm if you zoom out of the Philippines a for a moment I mean many of us are closely watching Facebook's operations here in the U.S and abroad and but the big question which you raise several times are they doing enough at Facebook to stop these campaigns weather is just information\nFake news hate speech or what do you think after spending a year investigating all this and actually being at ... you know H cue for Facebook\n[noise] well they um it's an interesting question because what does it mean enough and I asked people at Facebook you know what the standard for success here because there's no ability for us to audit them were really left in the position of having to take their word for it and whatever it is that the standard that\nThey set for themselves but there's so much that we just don't know but as a ... this this is a writer Alexis Madrigal from the Atlantic ah says in your dog and it's really it was a really powerful quote the very things that divide us the most are the things that get the most engagement of um talk about that have been where that's most evident right now\nWell we've got our mid term elections and um and we had you know that the horrific events here of the past week and scenes that whether it's the shooter in Pittsburgh or the attempted bomber\nUm these are people that are very radicalized on social media polarization and filter bubbles are are a real thing on social media and this kind of reinforcement of world view is that the main discussion happening right now I think\nJames after a year of working on this er and investigating Facebook or are you on the platform or what if you were or you know often\nI'm On it I've always taken uh I I have a very small footprint on their um which by the way it doesn't mean much in terms of what data they're collected on you [noise] um but ah it's just um [noise]\nYeah I'm I'm torn and sign up to ... who's in the film was a scholar at UNC\nUm says I think one of the most important in lines which is what are you going to do about the fact that all your friends and family are there is this tremendous thing to be able to communicate with people it really is an amazing invention budget so problematic so ... what are you gonna do\nJames Jacoby with

fairs\nOn concrete over and over and over and joined us\nStarting about thirty minutes or two here on NPR News service northwest public broadcasting\nDue to tell me a bit about reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nUm say overall although there has been expressions of condolence expressions of shocking to hire the new kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand\nThe impact that has had on the American Jewish community they don't fully understand the plays the synagogue life for American Jews they don't understand that for American Jews synagogue is a second home it's a place where kids grow up and Hebrew school\nWhere they hide as I did like hiding out for for Hebrew school in the bathroom with my friend and a place where you would play kind of come of age and that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I ... a share threat that a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from squirrel hell and I'm\nOne of the stories that move me most of the story of Jerry\nRuben ... six years old he was one of the eleven people who are murdered he rushed to the sound of the noise we don't know if you knew it was gunfire at that point to go help and that when he was shot\nAnd and as an immoral and Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this interesting custom dream orders cottage which is the Jewish prayer memorial I think the dead and it's set in every single service he stood up\nHe always stood up for the cash and that is traditionally a time it only go to our morning actually stand up and when asked why did he stand up every single time he said well I have no children so one\nDay there will be nobody's to stand for me so I stand for all of those who have no one to stand for them and on Saturday everybody stood up and stood for Jerry in in his memory and I think um\n[noise] that standing out to that ending up together is such a metaphor and I think overall Israeli Jews and Israeli general they don't need a cynic I give them Jewish community because they had their Jewish community\nWithin their own lives and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community if they want to hide a sense of solidarity among themselves that they find it in the walls or the synagogue\nThe president does reveal a quite a few differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker here\nAnd they think I'm an American Jews and Israelis are two very different paths right now did say American Jews for the most part are liberal like consider themselves very much attached to their immigrant roots and because of that they tend to support rights for immigrants they tend to very much believe in the end of the repeated in the Bible more than any other tenant which would\nBe kind to the stranger because you two are much went to a stranger in Egypt and so there's this very strong desire to not that you know American Jews have done fairly well for themselves in in America\nAnd feel fairly successful and so it's all very comfortable um and I think that comfort to the lead up to sort of be more liberal and more open where it is really juice still feel under attack they feel very much sort of the product of sort of post traumatic post Holocaust world where they look at\nThings very much and it sort of zero sum game it times you know a person's them whether it comes to Arab neighbors or you know\nI'm fresh from within somehow an Israeli the trans Jordan started like circling the wagons in fear and American jury you have a transit of towards plurality Jewish pluralism openness and I think that the vision coming more clearly now and for\nA task

fifty six just months after being diagnosed with brain cancer longtime friend and collaborator Virginia was sort of gates was one of the very first scientist to make the connection between coral bleaching on global warming\nStarted in the Nineteen eighties in the very early days when none of us understood what was going on she was able to show that corals did this strange pay lanes and she was able to ...\nOver the years gates became a bowl of teacher and an eternal optimist in a field whose future looks grim until the dust gates led a research lab at the University of Hawaii but trying to figure out ways to help coral adopt to warming oceans friend Virginia was says she was also in regular and vibrant public speaker\nI don't remember her ability to light up a room and make everyone in the room feel like she's talking jets to them she\nHad this wonderful silky highbrow English accent that she joked with her secret weapon and she was able to tell the story of coral and she was brilliant at it she really excelled at it\n[noise] I Know you've described her as an iconic closet or feel why\nSo she was and I kind of class and a couple of different ways the best one to think about right now is this idea of assisted evolution of coral very controversial it's the idea that humans need the help corals evolve faster to be able to tolerate\nThe heating that's happening and some scientists really think that that's not our place to do that but others led by roots really feel that we need to try a variety of options she's the first to admit it may not work but if you don't try it then we can't know\nBut personally I feel very strongly shoes and iconoclast in terms of\nThe way she approached science she disliked pushing your colleagues aside to get ahead and she was much more about cooperation and encouraging\nAll diversity brown people and women and because of that sometimes she ruffled feathers but she ruffled feathers to make the world a coral science a more inclusive cooperative place\nSuch determination to help his coral reefs are in the face of the past few years several major coral reef bleaching events\nAnd the rest of the news isn't good I'm In coral reefs are expected to be almost completely destroyed in coming decades and yet Rick Gates remained so optimistic how did she retained that optimism will studying something so depressing\nIt's such a great question Marco I think all of us are trying to bottle that um especially in light of her life she just looked forward and she felt like you know we can throw her hands up and give up or we can look for solutions then I think her enthusiasm really instilled\nHang on to about Rick Gates [noise] her\nYou know she was not a big person but she had this huge laugh that failed the round
