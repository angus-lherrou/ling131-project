it's assigned five scenario but it may not be that far from reality that\nAt least is the warning coming this week from a new report from the government Accountability Office found that the country's next generation weapons systems could be easy targets for cyber attacks\nThat made some experts in the field I think about the TV show Battlestar Galactica [noise]\nIn it an enemy civilization has taken out humanities entire fleet of fighter jets find affecting their computers the Gmail report found real life owner abilities and us defense systems Emily drives us has been covering this for wired Emily weapons systems at the center of this report\nVery good an unanswerable question actually this report is written\nIt is an unclassified report but these weapons systems are themselves classified some nowhere in this report or the weapons as soon as their selves named we can do that these are everything from jet fighters to anti missile\nInterceptors and an every kind of weapon system that the Pentagon is developing [noise] wow [noise]\nSo so what kind of vulnerability is did the report find\nAll sorts of vulnerability is the scariest thing I think it's\nSeems to have been developed without cyber security in mind which means that these aren't necessarily vulnerabilities that are\nOnly for high level hackers to take advantage of these aren't like really hard to get into systems some of these things were just that they found be fault password hadn't changed on the software\nOf these systems so the testers were able to take over these systems completely just by guessing password in one case it was as simple as guessing a password and nine seconds\nAnd in some in many cases the DOD weapons developers did not notice that the testers were in their system acting like hackers and they even didn't notice when the testers we're trying to be intentionally noisy\nTo make themselves visible so that they would be found even then they weren't found\nNow to be clear these are weapons systems that are already deployed or are they things that are being developed and are going to be deployed what what kind of time period we're talking about so we are talking about systems that are\nBeing developed the reason why this report was done by the government Accountability Office was at the Senate Armed forces committee asked them to look into the ah weapons that did\nDOD wants to spend one point six six trillion dollars to roll out and bring to scale that they can use them so it is likely that some of these weapon systems are already in use but they are going to be rolled out further but many of these are things that are\nBeing developed and are not yet being used\nThis sounds like one big giant mess I mean how can this kind of stuff happened\nI think because there is still a real disconnect in understanding how important cyber security is especially even with physical weapons\nIn the jails report noticed a noted that test officials said that many within the D O D did not believe cyber security even applied to weapons system\n[noise] one twenty keep listening to world continue in just a moment here on northwest public broadcasting if you ever

farmers in Wisconsin and New York state that a lot of other states\nVery badly the new trade deals still needs legislative approval but it would give us dairy farmers more access to a Canadian markets Jason Margolis went to Ontario to hear from farmers there\nPhilip Armstrong's family has been farming in ... Ontario for a very long time\nOur family has been on this piece of land um since Eighteen sixty nine\nObviously dairy farming has evolved a lot then it's also made a huge leap sends Armstrong graduated college thirty seven years ago today each have is three hundred and eighty cows whereas a high tech color we watch is twenty four cows getting milk in a computer measures they're outside\nThe caller says they have on them [noise] his id but it also measures her eating habits on an individual count it measures her room in the stomach flu is to make sure that that's going well it measures are lying down time measures her activity\nCombine that technology with better breeding and nutrition and Armstrong says his cows are nearly twice as productive as for decades ago\nIt might seem great but it's also created a problem for the world's dairy farmers they're producing too much milk so to keep things in check Canada has a system called supply management peach farm\nHas a quota and that's our share of the Canadian Marc\nThey match supply with consumer demand as part of its supply management system Canada also places high tariffs unimportant dairy imports up to about three hundred percent\nThat's what's enraged President Trump's Canada does lead in some American dairy before terrorists kicking and it's part of the updated NAFTA Canada would open up a few percentage points more to the Americans\nYou go okay well so much for growth in income we're giving up that allows us to modernize to expand so it's frustrating for us as dairy farmers\nAnd perplexing the dairy trade between the U.S and Canada is a sliver of overall trade between the two nations and Armstrong is annoyed that President Trump singled out Canadian dairy as the problem\nEven distorting the facts or maybe didn't understand the fact that don't know and so is that we were hurting their dairy farmers well Americans had a six hundred\nAnd many American dairy farmers agreed with President Trump and applaud him for standing up for them they point out that Canada also recently read to find some of its milk products which could effectively shut out American products\nTheir pain is real thousands of small American dairy farms have shut down in recent years it's not all because of Canada far from it they'd been squeezed out by consolidation corporate agriculture global competition and low prices people are also consuming less milk\nA lot of male cat in the past has been a dumped because it couldn't be processed inappropriate time or sold at an extreme discount\nBrian Gould is a professor of agribusiness at the University of Wisconsin well us dairy farmers maybe in a bad place ... says the U.S shouldn't be telling Canada how to manage its agriculture\nWe have no right to do that I really think we're on thin ice when we demand that they get rid of their quota system\nGold says I think that the reverse Canada telling us to dismantle its production system the U. S. government sets a minimum price for milk and provide some subsidies us also has its own high tariffs on certain dairy products sour\nCream for instance that so I think if I don't remember exactly as like\nGrand Lloyd the c._e._o. of the dairy farmers of Ontario couldn't put his finger on the exact amount the U.S sour cream tariffs is one hundred and eighty seven percent\nAnd Lloyd says there are a lot of other us tariffs on other cheese and then that you have like fifty percent terrorists Lloyd says this whole milk spat with Canada it's just politics\nWisconsin being a significant important states the Republicans namely obviously Speaker Ryan and it was a state that carried Trump became a political lightning rod and that is what started the whole process\nFacts on the farm fill up arms says the new NAFTA agreement to address the fundamental problem American farmers are producing too much milk and Armstrong believes opening a little bit more of Canada will make a dent in that\nYou know I feel for the dairy farmer in the United states I mean if ... what was happening in front of her up here but it has no impact on their on their wellbeing it all\nAgain plenty of Wisconsin in New York farmers see things differently they're glad to have more access\nTo the Canadian markets still there is an ironic twist here many American dairy farmers and organizations are actually now\nFor the world Jason Margolis Khalid on Ontario\nFrom this week we've been obsessed with what could be a murder story the victim Saudi journalist on October second ... entered the Saudi Arabian constantly in Istanbul and it's not been seen since we're not the only ones obsessed\nInside Saudi Arabia and outside I think we're all trying to figure out what has happened to him\nSo how ... is a Saudi journalist and filmmaker who made a documentary critical of Saudi Arabia she also new Jamal ... Mike him she lives outside the Saudi kingdom because she says speaking up can get you in trouble with the authorities there\nDissidents human rights activists or even just simple critics of what's going on Saturday for the past few years have been put in prison taken from different countries and brought back to Saudi Arabia and so Japan is the highest profile of something that's been going on inside tied to radio\nFor more than a year now I Would say that everything\nIs also tell us again what happened to you after you produce a documentary\nSo that the government officially accused me of supporting terrorism and so this shows a lack of understanding of the Saudi Government itself of what is independent drummer but because there isn't anything called independent journalism and Saudi Arabia and so like for a lot of people even when I was being interviewed about the film\nThere were like how would you like to be identified are you a Saudi dissident and it's like no I'm a journalist covering the story\nBut because there is no such platforms inside proud of radio where you can say these things we all become dissidents inadvertently and there was no other space and this\nIs the problem with with with how the Saudi Government dealing with everyone right now they are shutting down even though my oldest of comments and critique about\nTheir policy and so they've left no room for us they've left no room for us to be able to properly Congress stories and then they love criticizing journalists for not understanding what's going on in Saudi Arabia and so it's a lose lose situation for us\nHas has the government clamped down harder since Mohammed bin Salman came I Can't lose\nHer absolutely on everyone I mean like ... before you could be a human rights activists on for example woman driving or being critical of the economic reform and Saudi Arabia\nAnd there wouldn't be as much backlash as now we fought like a lot of the activists that have been arrested before the ban was lifted that there would be released by now but instead of being released a lot more pressure has been put on them and they're using them in our state\n[noise]\nComing up an American pastor

genes and it feels like something is pressing down on you like a mattress\nI didn't experience nearly the level that they did but just imagine kind of feeling like you're pressed up against something you're ill so much heavier that's what they were feeling and it can be pretty intense\nAre there any new details about what might have caused this problem\nI don't know if they've traced the exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separations so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four main boosters around the center core\nAnd they were supposed to break away but Russian and things that maybe there was some contact between one of the boosters innocent our core will when really they are supposed to separate completely just won the sixty ... of this particular sways rocket so it's been around for decades [laughter] I don't know if they know what caused that contact\nBut I think that's the leading theory at the moment\nNow the U.S and Russia they're frequently at odds especially these days when it comes to geopolitics but they cooperate frequently when it comes to space flight one is that\nNASA has been kind of shiny beacon of hope in our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let geopolitics inter no it definitely creeps into other\nAspects when Russia invaded Ukraine that kind of sparked a debate about whether or not the military should use Russian rocket technology to launch satellites into space so it has had an impact on other parts of our space infrastructure but when it comes to NASA we just can't let those things get in a way we need then\nAt the moment because this way is is the only way to get humans to the international space station so we have to continue cooperating and hopefully not that Russia will let geopolitics getting the way that\nIsn't significant setback for the international space station I Would\nSay it's definitely concerning about the nation's future we currently have three astronauts into orbit\nAbsolutely can't last forever and or but they have a few hundred or below the lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days\nInto that so there are slated to come down in December they could probably stretch that to January but not very long so either they're going to have to come down or Russia could possibly launch an anti science capsule and then not up to the station and give them an extra two hundred gauge to stay on board\nBut that hasn't been determined yet we don't know if that's actually going to happen it just depends on what the investigation finds\nLearn crushes senior science reporter for the verge\nThanks learn things out in this next story is also about Russia but guess
