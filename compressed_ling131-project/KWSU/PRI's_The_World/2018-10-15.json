starting it to him again at seven right here on northwest Public Broadcasting's NPR News service\nRight now we're somewhere in the middle of that cycle heading closer straight up and down so the Arctic Circle is moving north and for Iceland this means that it's slowly slipping away Grimm's he is currently don't only habitable spot in the country touched by the Arctic Circle and not drawn tourists here for decades as the Chrysler\nDescribes what they did here as you would have noticed when you arrived in the plane is there is a sign that may devolve medium and thoughts were unloading tourists of Europe and they can walk around a swine give them a certificate send them back home again\nIn twenty Thirteen the local government decided this simple Arctic Circle marker would do for an upgrade so they launched a competition and like Christian said earlier the information they put out said that the Arctic Circle is moving fourteen centimeters a year but still just he told them it was actually moving a whole lot more than that\nAn average of fourteen meters a year in the spot and at that rate the Arctic Circle only touched currency for a few more decades\nIf I had to leave the island wasn't forties chauvinist between countries ...\nAfter that the Arctic Circle will leave all of Iceland behind for thousands of years until the earth access begins to swing back in the other direction this was not great news for the people's ... they'd always been told the Arctic Circle ran through the middle of their island\nWith one remembered phones or so and you saw was true [noise]\nSteven Christian realized they had a decision to make sick\nAnd ignore the science of how the Arctic Circle actually works and just make another stationary monument in the same old place or they could bust his new information reshape their whole idea for the monument and as you've no doubt gas they decided the complicated facts were much more interesting than a nice easy section\nSo so everything is changing it's sort\nOf only move so we had lots of different ways of representing this moment\nPresents what we're wrong because everything's up we're talking about thinking about is actually affected by poles\nOK so some kind of ball something that rules but also something that doesn't roll too much grins he is a really windy place\nIt has to have a certain presidents certain physicality a certain weight\nSo an enormous mall of concrete losing ... tons it's three meters in diameter or about nine feet\nSo it's it's bigger than us you know there was the thing that we realized that has to be\nBig enough to be something that you couldn't put your arms rocked it even if five people link that Arthur it'd be it'd be having a struggle so it's it's something you you can't contain it has its own life doesn't some things and we just have to follow like now even though we know he's going north this summer it will go so\nYep you heard that right it's even more complicated\nThe Arctic Circle isn't only moving in one direction moon has an effect to ... says that has the earth's axis ways back and forth about twenty thousand years in each direction there was a much smaller faster wobble happening as well this one is caused by the moon\nOn is to certain things about Eighteen following six years\nWhen it comes down to is this the movement of the Arctic Circle isn't a straight line it's a squid all a big line moving in one direction with a bunch of smaller little ... and then just when I thought I really understood what was going on or seen said this\nLooks awesome as one factor is comes into this from people in every single person and not to use the movement of the earth's crust this is something we can't produce very accurately\nPieces of the earth's crust are also moving in that throws another wrench in the works I have to say as I was learning all of us\nMy heart kind of went out to Steve and Kristin and the competition organizers it seemed like a simple challenge make a monument to the Arctic Circle on his tidy little line the human beings have drawn around the top of the earth\nBut the deeper these two went into it the more complex that became\nBut I think that's also something you said just you get older you realize that you don't have a grasp on everything the older you get the more you realize you don't know\nThat kind of thing happens to all of us this moment when you learn something new that makes everything so much harder and more complicated than we thought and then we have to decide if we're going to take\nActions are impacting the climate for some of us it can get so overwhelming that will grab on to any alternative story anything that helps us just to turn away\nAnd one of those stories is actually related to this story it's a narrative that says the planet is heating up because of changes in ... and other natural processes not our carbon pollution you may have heard this yourself and wondered\nThere'll be anything to that so let's take a quick look\nFirst of all the earth's climate does of course change naturally the planet has always fluctuated between ice ages warmer periods and changes in ... are part of what drives that pattern\nBut those changes play out over tens or even hundreds of thousands of years\nThe warming we're experiencing now is happening at lightning speed in comparison we can measure it in decades\nAnd the cause of that warming is clear it's us burning fossil fuels moves carbon into the atmosphere and not traps more heat this is a fact so we have a choice do we try to push it aside so that we don't have to change or do we accept the truth as difficult as it might be\nWhen it came to making the Arctic Circle monument Steven Kristen chose option number two they open themselves up to the more complicated truths [noise]\nAnd it turned out to lead to something pretty darn cool [noise]\nIt's just a moving to use or punish the stroke which which has nothing you can touch or see unless you're interested in what's the object is following this idea\n[noise] bowling is the least important about [noise] the piece of self is the movement bought the bull does is it represents the movement\nWe humans don't really like change we like sharp lines from definitions but the actual physical world doesn't work this way it's really hard to find a straight line in nature instead they're occurs twists and blurred boundaries and always always change\nI Would have you ever if your finger children's\nThe then it turns out the Arctic Circle and an eight ball of concrete both of which are scheduled to leave the island in a year twenty forty seven\nI'm not swimming Christian and I go up there with all my friends and kick it into the ocean\n\nQuestion we started with here is what is the Arctic and the answer anything about the things the Aggies line which fluctuate between sixty five and a half in sixty eight degrees north which is so messy and complicated there's
