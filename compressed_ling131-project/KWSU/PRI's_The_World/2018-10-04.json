um of one candidate or another and in those races\nGenerally how would you say these operations are right now compared to what we saw in the twenty sixteen us presidential election both in terms of the end goal and uh the strategy how it's actually done what\nWe're seeing an evolution of tactics so this is definitely an arms race the social media platforms haven't proved to their ability to detect certain types of tactics that we know are associated with foreign influence but of course new tactics are evolving\nA new proxies are being developed or new human assets are being cultivated so that for an actress can operate through real Americans an offshoot skate their activity\nAnd in terms of strategy I'd say that's been largely consistent from one election to the next\nAs much as there's been a huge focus on whether or not the Russian operation was focused on supporting the Trump campaign over the Clinton campaign ultimately I think what we've seen over the long term is that they're real strategy was focusing on things that were very divisive and of course presidential elections are very divisive and\nAnd the more divisive they can make that conversation the better in the cabin on nomination and the me too movement of the allegations of sexual assault I think of course\nThat's been a a a very sort of an open wound for the country right now so it's really no surprise

Brazil to prevent the spread of disinformation or as people there had to polls over the weekend this coming weekend our Facebook and other social media companies doing the same kind of things here in the U.S they are\nAnd I think working with fact checkers is certainly one part of the solution of course we want the information that gets disseminated on line to be authentic and correct\nBut what we think about is this information is actually less about the truth or the authenticity in any given the story and more about how it's distributed\nIf the platform being manipulated to elevate one story or one narrative at one point of view over another and I think that's where the social media platforms are also starting to work with third parties to identify the sort of manipulated distribution\n[noise] I just want to ask you about the the news today a department of justice that charging seven Russian military officials for hacking into anti doping agency's and activists as well as a Pennsylvania nuclear energy concerned um\nAgainst the concern of more apparent election meddling\n[noise] I think this is actually an indication that what we traditionally think about as cyber warfare and what we started to think about his information warfare are actually one of the same\nAnd the more that we think about these two things as being synonymous are overlapping the more we'll be able to defend ourselves against these types of attacks in the future and thoughtfully engage with our adversaries around what isn't isn't acceptable\nOr you know what are the rules of the road in terms of this ongoing combat between nations that are sometimes friends and sometimes adversaries\nJonathan Morgan is the c._e._o. of new knowledge you also founded data for democracy an organization
