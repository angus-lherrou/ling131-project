know show would follow ice agents around as they conduct raise looking for suspected undocumented immigrants\nAnd the purpose of this t._v. show uh sensibly entertainment you may be surprised to hear that a TV show much like that does exist in Japan Nevin Thompson has seen it he's Japan editor for the online news ... news organization global voices\nWell it's like a typical uh reality cop show in this case immigration officers go out and seek out um I guess these over stairs or people who are working against the terms of of their their reason Japan\nMistake people you're there with him in the car um they they capture them interrogate them and then um as the title of the show suggested to forwarded on the next plane type thing\nWow what what's the name of the show either in Japanese or a translation and English\nIn Japanese it's called ...\nWhich I guess translate says caught at the moment of deportation wow minutes actually modeled on another a cop show it in Japan called a title don't shoot which is like caught at the moment of arrest sounds like a trend\nWell yeah I mean there's a lot of these shows everywhere in the world you know I'm In Canada where I'm from for example uh we had a show like this\nBut uh Canada border's services agency collaborated with with the producers and actually the key to government help funded and so they would go out and look for so called illegal immigrants and stuff like that very tasteless and it was only taken off the air because of the uh it'd be contravene privacy regulations Canada\nWhat is the tone of the the Japanese program and what were your impressions of it\nWell I mean it's\nIt's very literate and breathless um when you eat you basically have a a Japanese person I'm narrating what's happening it's just it's kind of odd because like their tone is very tricky and in writing pleasant so now the the immigration agents are on their way to\nThe the dormitory were some Vietnamese a guest workers are suspected of of of hiding out in it and it sort of narrative and seeds\nYou know you're driving down the road ... it's kind of odd because like because Jeff Japan also has very stringent privacy regulations you can't really show anybody's face so everything is word out including the like the neighborhood where it is 'cause like like say if you show the neighborhood\nUm the people who live there would probably can plane in ... that create a slash and so it's just like this is like an hour and a half of like worry blurt out\nImages you can't see people's spaces voices are describes it was quite an odd program\nThis was a two hour episode aired earlier this month is that a one off or are they going to be more episodes that follow these migrant raids and deportations\nI imagine there probably will be a because ah the the program did to cooperate with uh the Tokyo branch of the national immigration girl\nSo they they I mean there's people who put a lot of time and effort into set in this thing up and and just also because the the immigration bureau is going to be elevated status to an immigration agency and get more resources I'd assumed is going to be somewhere PR efforts like this too\nI gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan or what have active it's been saying\nWell I mean yeah I like on line there is considerable backlash from anti racism activists who are very well organized in Japan Japan is a very vibrant anti racism a movement and so yeah they they basically said ... entertainment like why why are you showing people being deported\nHow can this be entertainment and then um the the mainstream media picked it up so you know various newspapers ran articles about you know how degrading the show is\nI mean is it shot in front of 'cause I mean like ... the bad guys aren't really bad guys they just are looking for a job and you know trying to stay a little longer to make some money and overstayed their work permits\nWell I mean I guess they'd be the obvious appeal is racism because people I suppose have\nBiases about uh people from other countries the uh they don't speak our language or they look a bit different and and they're coming over here and taking our jobs type thing so I'm but personally I I'm not sure like uh I think it's just kind of aware of sensational kind of a cheap TV to watch\nI remember the cop show theme song ended it by getting samples all over the place that they have a a catchy theme ten that everybody's not singing [laughter]\nI mean I I guess you might think also we live in a time when around the world I think people are feeling less secure than ever before just because of a say for example Donald Trump for Brexit or invasion of Crimea so maybe\nProvide some reassurance that someone's doing something to
