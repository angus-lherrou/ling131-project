think in this election and that as a religion Giovanna said she's Catholic but not really practicing and that is true for a lot of people in Brazil but\nI'm also true for a lot of people in Brazil is

Bangladesh been pushing for this one point five degree target for a long time I would say they're happy that it's still technically feasible to reach that and also that this report that so thoroughly documents the differences in real human experience between one point five degrees and two degrees\nWill help focused even more on that MORNING EDITION target which I'll do it would be very difficult to reach I think that increased focus would be seen as a positive by a lot of people\n[noise] the world's Carolyn Beeler there the winners of this year's Nobel Prize in economics or to American

pressing economic issues of our age\nNorth house as a pioneer in environmental economics he started warning policymakers in the Nineteen seventies that their economic models were failing to take the impact of climate change into account [noise]\nNew York university professor Paul Romer helped create the modern approach to understanding innovation and how it relates to economic growth and joins us now from NYU Stern school of business uh first of all professor congratulations I have you had a chance to speak with your fellow winner William ...\nNo I haven't I just wrote one of his but like a nephew hoping that I can find out how to get in touch with Bill it's really a terrific honor to be linked together with him he's just a great scholar and exceptionally decent guy couldn't ask for better association\nSo your work is linked to the work of Dr an art house how would you describe your work\nWe're both interested in not the kind of trade off that's common and economics like we can use this field to produce a little more corn or a little more wheat what Bill and I were focused on is the huge gains that can come from discovering new\nHe of new ideas that gives you more of both corn and wheat so that's a unifying element in what we do [noise] you know we have our own different specialization bill is really the one who's focusing exclusively on climate change like you know I'm very supportive of that work and I firmly persuaded that\nThe real key to addressing the ... of the energy system will be\nTechnological progress and the key to policy right now should be do encourage this amazing machines for discovering that we have a modern economy just encouraged apt to go tackle history important problem\nSo it sounds like your body of research looks at that discovery of new things part of technology can you talk about how that overlaps with the work of Dr Norton house in ... with climate change there's very\nSimple model that would say something like oh the government's\nSupport basic scientific research by bit giving grants to university professors than the private economy puts that knowledge to work\nProfessors love that story because it involves the government getting money to professor so you know [laughter] they're they're keen on that but the truth is that most discovery and most learning comes from the work on specific problems\nAnd the academics often come along later and kind of clean up afterwards like when people started working out how to use steam engines to do work it was much later that physicists came along and invented thermodynamics to figure out you know what the heck are these guys doing so it wasn't like thermodynamics led to the invention steam\nEngines steam engines led to the ... you know there was a real advantage to creating incentives for start ups and firms to go out and try and make a business in this area and so I think both bill and I would recommend a kind of attacks\nOn say carbon based energy sources\nYou need to use government policy to unleash this machine for discovering which is the modern accounting professor what's next for you I went to the world bank right after the vote on Brexit but I was the summers when he's sixteen\nYep yep that for me was a real red flag there were many things going on there were still trying to understand that part of what was going on is there a lot of people who basically said if the economists are for or against it so if a whole lot of people say of us are for or against it\nKind of us need to pay attention and figure out what we did wrong to lose
