S. means automatic citizenship we talked about that and the fourteenth amendment yesterday today we want to spend some time exploring different ideas about citizenship\nLet's start with a simple documents that is a powerful symbol of citizenship a passport\nYour home country your passport can dictate easy travel or blocked access because not all passports are created equal the roaster insofar as starts us off\nIt takes a lot of courage to leave your day job to travel the world it takes even more courage if you're not rich and you hold an Iranian passport ten years that well that's exactly what ... ... dead he quit his job at the physics teacher intent on cash\n[noise] hard headed on skis in Siberia [noise]\nHe's played by the phone with locals Lindsey bumping\n[noise] any stronger traditional slow he needs to look at Mount Kilimanjaro\nDon't build or no disclosure I was with him on that trip is a friend [noise] today plus I make\nThem living by organizing and needing budget friendly toward for small groups of Iranian when choosing a destination he tells me the first question on his mind is how easy is it going to be to get a visa\nMore times this one about a month for ... years that he would go to your ...\nUnfortunately in my house or there's a huge by a gigantic mountain he tells me he's speaking from his home in ...\nUh all the time how do you want to do something about about Bush's ...\nFor a lot of people will deport passports evokes movement travel before me he said it's the opposite is a reminder of hardship and pain just got me thinking how does an Iranian passports compared to\nOther down I've passed Venezuela I've passed St Vincent\nOn hold up under ... she's the author of the cosmopolitan the coming off the gold once said it's a it's a book about citizenship and passports about the war\nUm it was a Pakistan Molly Liberia I think I think he runs all the way down there\nA hundred and thirty minutes to the exact out of a hundred and sixty eight countries on the list [noise]\nWhat I see a bohemian is looking at is called the quantity of nationality index it's a Viking of countries put together by private sector they take into account things like freedom of travel peace and stability France and Germany on at the top of this is the U.S ranked twenty seven\nYou don't you with your parents you don't you know where you're born you don't always choose where you live and uh it's so arbitrary you know arbitrary\nDifficult enough to be the holder of an Iranian passports even tougher if you're from the south Sudan Yemen according to this list so what do you do if you come from one of these countries\nYou're tuned to the world [noise]\n[noise] it took over one of the country's biggest financial services company is just as the crisis was getting going and a decade later\nIt's even bigger conversation with the c._e._o.

hawk or is his name for the past month he's been traveling around the U.S speaking with voters and filming a documentary about it what struck him so far here's what he said and mind you this was before the Pittsburgh synagogue attack division\nBush struck by the amount of division in America or may not been traveling here since Nineteen Ninety six to observe presidential campaigns and I've never seen anything quite like that\nEverybody here and there is in their respective camping\nIt's almost impossible to find anybody who is sitting on the fancy and they're all in one camp or the other end have very very strongly held views about Donald Trump he is the story\nAnd I don't get a sense that Americans are very happy politically right now even those who are on either side I think there's a sense of disconnect and it upsets people\nIt's the same story everywhere we go on happiness that really seems to be on the painting a lot of what what you see and said this quiet I think which is permeating American society right now even for people who are very strong Trump supporters and we'll probably see themselves as being in the ascendency\nSo that's a hard road that I think Americans are taking right now\nSo the big question you're trying to answer talking to American voters is what matters to you how varied have those answers been extremely\nI may pay Trump's support as as I say Trump is being somebody who's just shaking up the country in a way that has never been done before\nAnd they believe that he's achieving things and then I'll cite North Korea is an example of that the tariffs wars with China on the other side of the coin it's division it's the shouting out it's the singling out of minority groups and individuals\nThat people find very offensive and drives a lot of their intentions in this midterm election\nYou know I mean the trade war on terror is that's not necessarily a good thing for people in the middle of the country farmers for example are you finding what\nThat is a fascinating thing you know we were just in Breckenridge, Minnesota just a few days ago and we conducted little focus group that primarily amongst farmers and what they told us was that even though ... not buying their crops the down by bad twenty five percent and returns that were prepared to give\n... that's well and good but ... now full and if we can solve this problem out really soon begin to have another habit thinks she can have anything to do with that\nSo it's interesting that sometimes their emotional attachment to a personal total Cole was kept out why the hip pocket and as we call it in stride and but you usually ... people's biting intentions are going to be\n... have you ever seen that dynamic like that back in Australia it's very rare\nExcept in as strategy we do have something of a Trump phenomena and it usually comes with people who once calling the shots in a society where they feel they're being left out left behind\nAnd I will sometimes support candidates who don't represent their interests and that happened a few years ago when we had one called polling Hansen she's still around and she ran a particular one nation very populist and\nShe was upsetting Asians and ... but people in tourists dependent electric was voting for her and say yeah sometimes people vote against their interests I read an article once and I said why did techies votes of Thanksgiving sometimes that just happens to\nThe question now I think that we're gonna have to be asking in two years' time if we come back as well\nHas Trump delivered on the big things that he said he was going to because right now what we're saying is that people who might be sitting in the middle I'm more inclined to cite will give him a chance to see how you guys and that's my main that the cycle blue light that's coming might just be more of a trickle\n[noise] how much does an issue like immigration or what we're talking about earlier ... how much did the opinions you heard from Americans vary depending on the region\n[noise] well it depended to a large extent actually in South Carolina you cannot get away from racism issue\nAnd people of ... they were very very distressed they felt that that will being singled out by Donald Trump and in fact we spoke to a Seventy seven year old man African American who grew up in the eyes of segregation in South Carolina had refused admission in the lunch counters in restaurants and\nSort it has roars and he said he had never seen anything like Donald Trump in his lifetime he had never seen such of racism and he's coming from a president does somebody and such high office he said it was much more subtle in the past and he felt it but he'd never felt this roar exposure\nThat's extraordinary [noise] Bruce you've been in the U.S before and as you\nTo take care of the civic responsibility of casting a vote\nWilling to strike we have ... taken that responsibility out of our hands and tell us we'll be fined if we die hard but as trying to take it for granted really that they have divided on election day and we have Ninety five percent turnout\nAnd that of course changes the nature of politics ... it means that the politicians are much more focused on the Santa Robin and having to energize the bikes all the time if you're ... you're a politician and ... you know that your traditional voters are going to come out and support you it's the people in the middle you have to convince\nAnd that means that ... politics even though it sounds very divisible times\nStill is much more inclusive in the basic tenants that on the pain the major political parties for example\nAh you know we have a national health scale which would never be touched by either to the major parties on I think the model ... it just is not an issue that I Know that if I were to pot from that that would be the end of the prospects of winning an election\n[noise] do you get the sense that Americans are more motivated to go to the polls this year\nMassively more motivated everywhere we go way hearing reports from journalists and all those that turnout is greater with early voting mental so registration that they Kevin uh issue has motivated and energized democratic voters particularly women\nSo on both sides with seeing this remarkable energizing I'd be very surprised if we don't say ... to meet him voting turnout and we're also getting at reports that in states like Georgia where there's been allegations of oppression\nThat that has had a reverse effect and that there is a very high turnout before the election die by people who presumably are offended by what's happening there\nAnd one of the things that are being doing is talking to young people and asking them well what do you think about Donald Trump and the priorities that he has a night basically say\nThat totally out of step with what we are worried about and the number one issue that we get back is climate change because this is the generation that's going to have to deal with these problems and the other end seem to generational dead but they really do worry about climate and climate change\nAnd you can understand why you know I Want to be around to see the worst effects of climate change but I Will not think that will become a bigger and bigger issue as this generation starts to assert more and more power\nBruce soccer is an Australian

R. G.\n[noise] news headlines are coming up next year with the world\nAnd the next fresh air had a Supreme Court became so politicized\nAnd how the court look now with Trump appointees and the chief justice who's considered the most likely to swing vote we'll talk with David Kaplan author of the most dangerous branch he was a legal affairs editor at Newsweek join us\nStarted thirty minutes at issue here on your NPR News service northwest public broadcasting [noise]\nOr you had troubles with the Obama administration your bosses and your tenure in Afghanistan was terminated where did the leadership there fail\nWell I mean part of it on my end\nThe reality is although President Obama had a different policy view than I did not hugely different I was you know very supportive of\nWhat he asked me to do but at a point and news story came out of a media story in Rolling Stone magazine that I didn't think was fair\nBut at the same time I'm a commander in Afghanistan and it is not it's my job not to let hot stories land on the desk of the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not\nGeneral McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this week we learned that the Pentagon and sending more than five thousand troops to the Mexican border uh five thousand more than double the number of troops in Syria what does that decision tell us about our current leadership\nThe decision to send U.S forces to somewhere like the border is a symbol\nAnd in the minds of some Americans have probably says how we have an invasion coming all we have an emergency we have to protect the homeland\nAnd while that's not the case it creates that mental image and sending regular military forces down there\n... and the idea that we're going to be decisive river really defending what we ought to do is putting drones out to get targeting Hindu airstrikes on the migrant convoy and just stop it before it gets close but of course that's absurd\nAnd that's immoral and that's not something that we're even thinking about doing but we shouldn't even send the idea that this is going to defend the walls of the Alamo however in some ways it is a crisis\nIt's a crisis because up close we're going to have the arrival of a number of people who want entry into the United states in many cases they have a pretty valid reasons for wanting to leave Honduras Guatemala\nA lack of opportunity plus threats to them and so now we're going to be up close and personal with a moral issue\nBruce issue here is one of our immigration policy and in America's values and we've got to look in the mirror decide what our values are adjust our policy reflects those and it's got to be a compromise because not all Americans are going to agree\nSo how do you feel our country is being led laid off from me what is your take on the on the time being set by the oval office\nI don't think our country is being led well it All right now but I Would expanded beyond the office I Would say on the left in the right there's a ... to the rhetoric now\nAnd this gets back to what we talked about earlier and values we need instead of looking at the TV and yelling at whatever side we don't like we need to look in the mirror and we need to say All right what are our values what do we want from our leaders because I don't expect the president to have the answers\nI expect the president to create an ecosystem in which the answers can be reached but I expect the president to reflect our values I expect to reflect the values for me I I expect the president to inspire me to be better than I might otherwise be\nWhat I Am weary and impatient I expect the president\nTo be the kind of symbol it says wow I Need to be a little more patient I Need to be a little more energetic whatever it is I Need to be a little more courageous a little more compassionate I expect the president to reflect all the things that we hope we can be\nAn does Donald Trump reflect your values does it reflect American values\nWell I think each of us has to ask ask ourselves that question\nI'm I'm Madeleine you does he reflect your values general\nI think I just answered that question I I don't believe that President Trump reflects the kind of inspirational leadership that I respond to but I'm One person and the real question is how each of us do and we need to we need to be very honest with ourselves first and then with each other\n[noise] General Stanley McChrystal his new book is leaders myth unreality thank you very much

you need to have a course of action not just sit there and what your family die and so folklore provided an avenue for this\nParticular brand of folklore wasn't variant on a practice born in places
