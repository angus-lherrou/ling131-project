just to kind of monitor the situation how did everything go when the actual crossing the border happen\nRight I mean they did more than monitor they fired tear gas\nThe migrants and then I think from

having anything to do with it now they admit ... died inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul as a result of a fight\nFew are buying it all along President Trump is facing mounting pressure to punish Saudi Arabia if it did murder ... but the president has been reluctant to do that in part because he says American Jobs are at stake\nSix hundred thousand jobs maybe more than than you'd be very hurtful to this country and we said oh we're not going to sell it to you\nSo how many Americans would lose their jobs if President Trump stopped selling weapons to the Saudis\nArms and security analyst William Hartung studies weapon sales at the center for international policy we'd like you to crunch the numbers for as you've heard President Trump's figures he mentioned six hundred thousand jobs in that clip just a moment ago how many us defense jobs actually depend on Saudi Arabia\n[noise] well it's hard to know precisely but you know a year and a half ago the president said it was forty thousand jobs there hasn't been a major platform where they've actually signed a deal since President Trump came into office so\nEven if they you know decided to get rid of some that made under Obama we'd be\nOr the other day as well you know in the economy with a hundred and thirty million people employed it's just a blip I mean obviously if you work in a particular factory\nWhere things are built that are being solved the Saudis it's a different matter but it's for our economy as a whole it's certainly not much and certainly not a reason to arm a murderous regime that's not only kill the journalists but is bombing thousands of people in Yemen\nThe president talks about Saturday contracts Boeing and raise the on you're saying that those contracts date back to the Obama administration so just tell us how many deals are currently signed and what have the salaries paid for\nAnd there was some big here in the Obama period where they offered sixty billion dollars worth of weapons all in a couple of packages\nSo not all of us have gone through but accepting fighter planes Apache attack helicopters those happened and those were worth tens of billions of dollars some of that money has already slowed and they've started delivering the fifteenth so the\nMoney is water under the bridge it's already been spent we're not going to see it again it would be hard for them to interrupt a deal that's in mid flow because allegedly they need these systems so what's actually on the table that might change is the deal for a missile defense system called fat\nWhich was introduced during the Trump period and they've got to agree on the details so in theory the Saudis could say well you know this particular deal we're not going to go through with\nAnd is there any risk if Trump or to ... that in China or Russia would pick up any of the business\nSaudi Arabia's whole military it's built on us in UK supplied weapons communications and maintenance and spare parts it would take a long time to turn that around\nSo William just give us the big picture here how important is the defense industry like all the jobs from planning to production how much of the U.S economy depends on defense goods and how much is that is reliant on Saudi Arabia\nWell everything the Pentagon spending accounts for about three and a half percent of our entire economy and not all that has weapons and then the Saudi peace has a tiny fraction of that less than a tenth of a percent I Would say so\nIt's really for the national economy it's not really important at all it's marginal it's it's really important and very specific places where a particular bomb is built for a particular aircraft\nI mean it's hard to know why President Trump wheels out numbers that actually aren't totally accurate but if you had to guess why do you think he would be bringing those numbers way way up\nI think partly he likes to show himself in sort of a master dealmaker who's getting the best deal for the American people on the American worker and you can see that on his trade policy as well\nBut also I think he's trying to change the conversation away from the ...\nWilliam Hart telling
