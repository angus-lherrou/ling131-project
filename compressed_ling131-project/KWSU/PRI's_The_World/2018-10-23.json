fact\nThat you need to protect your own borders on your your only does well on the other hand there's like the whole movement in the public opinion on Mexico saying guys we should treat the Central Americans as we require the Americans to treats our Mike Rounds up on the ...\nWhat about right now we're seeing Mexican police in riot gear some of them look like they're ready to go to battle what rights to the Mexican immigration laws give the migrants right now we're traveling through the country\nLook that for decades Mexican southern border there has to be very ... meaning that we have like four years hundreds of thousands of immigrants\nFrom South and Central America traveling through Mexico we have heavily invested in the country and our southern border to provide more facilities for new crossing and to provide humanitarian be set for those probably still the north\nAnd yet Mexican police fired tear gas at some of the migrants enclosed aboard or did you see that as a serious effort or just ...\nWhat I see is that Mexican police work or not they were having the shells and and the guy says but they were not carrying guns because that was the limit they said like they didn't want ... least clashes\nSo the Mexican police had no live ammunition could Mexican police and security stop the migrants that they want it to 'cause they force in the back south\nThey could do that my guess is that they Mexican on Thursday we'll try to negotiate with them in order for them to apply for humanitarian be says\nDaniel how do you think most Mexicans view the Central Americans passing through Mexico right now or are they welcoming them would they accept them if they were to stay\nOn the one hand you'll see that a lot of people like come on people even like working class people try to immigrants providing them with\nCase we were the country that receive so many Europeans particularly Spaniards fleeing from CBS wires and World War two but you'll still see some sectors in the mix you sense of safety saying these people are coming to steal our jobs\nFor Mexico is not so easy just to ignore or scrapped the U.S\nPoints of view in this issue\nWe are countries that are heavily dependent upon each other Fifteen hundred billion dollars per year trade but on the other hand Mexican public opinion they are not happy with the fact of the government just taking orders from another

Enrique Pena Nieto Danielle thank you for your time\nHappy to talk to you Michael\nYesterday President Trump announced that he would make cuts in U.S foreign aid for three Central American countries Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador they've been receiving the said since twenty sixteen and it's expected to go down by nearly forty percent twenty Nineteen that means cutting tens of millions of dollars and financial assistance to the region\nWe wanted to know what that eight actually goes to\nSarah appears as with the migration Policy Institute in Washington\nSo what has this aid been used for what what was it earmarked for and how was it used\nBlood is very wide variety of issues I mean one of the biggest issues when you're talking specifically about the north end triangle country and the alliance for prosperity they say it's a program that rhetoric out as a separate migration crisis that we had into that them fourteen when a lot of company ... migrants arrived at our southern border\nPresident Obama at that time and knowledge to that in order to really address migration you need to go to the root causes and and look at what's going on in these countries to cause people to ... and really had less mass exodus [laughter]\nThe alliance for pack their ideas designed to increase economic prosperity in their home countries and strengthen institution they can learn a lot of issues with corruption so that's one of our our major programs going into these countries and and one of the programs that the president and reality is threatening to the end\nSo regardless of how much eventually get stripped out of the budget line for a Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador Ken the tropics\nLooking at the law as it might be possible that he has the ability to transfer maybe ten percent of what has been appropriated but now he cannot do that you know laterally and of course because Congress isn't in session now if he really wanted to to end it to these countries he'd really need to wait until they come back in session after November\nOr how political do see this move being with someone with Trump believes will play well with Republican voters prior to the midterms\nYeah absolutely President Trump ran immigration he saw that issue when him the election and I think he thinks that it is a good one for Republicans going into the midterms so this caravan is actively as a political guests to him in Republican\nIn that they can play this up they can play themselves up as the party that is hard line on immigration and that will save the country quote unquote from this caravan\nTrump made this announcement yesterday or have you heard any news from Honduras or El Salvador Guatemala about what could happen if as much as forty percent of of this gets caught\nI think the northern triangle country and and Mexico as well are are doing a good job of trying to\nWeed through what's coming out from the president and what's coming out in the press and and try to stick to what's actually happening on the ground they recognize that we had a very eminent election in the country\nAnd they're just trying to stick with what they think will will actually come so I haven't heard a lot of real concern on the ground up around that aid\nAnd just because it seems so unlikely that Congress would go through with a threat like that\nAnd what is your organization the migration Policy Institute planning in terms of strategy to to take the song\nUs we're really looking at those reforms to an asylum like I mentioned earlier we actually published a report last month\nAdvocating for certain reforms to the asylum system including changing asylum for individuals who are applying at our border like a caravan\nSo that and it operates more efficiently because right now if if anyone in the caravan apply for asylum they'll likely be placed in our immigration court backlog which stretches on for years\nSo lovely waiting in the United states and the way down the line and immigration court judge will have to pick up their case and started from scratch and see if it's in sincere\nAsylum application\nIn reality we'd like to see a more efficient system operating at the
