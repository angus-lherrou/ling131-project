Diego\nUSA Today published an opinion piece pen by President Trump today drop attack the plans of some Democrats to expand Medicare to include everyone Trump called that socialism here's a quote the new Democrats are radical socialist who want to model America's economy\nBecause here he reports on language for us so people in the right Patrick a blonde attack their opponents for being socialists what's different than how Trump used the word today\nWas funny you know this in a way there's nothing different from what people have been saying for decades about socialism like basically it was just a standing communism right\nNow though some of like the politicians on the left she embracing socialism you think of bunny son does New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio Cortez they identify social or what it's supposed to mean\nFor\nSocial values that I Believe that modern\nMoral society now ... checkpoint and laughs [noise]\nPretty Sanders a court says they use the term democratic socialist what what does that tell us because it kind of a branding their socialism away from Marcus revolution and communism as you were saying\nYeah I think that's what they're trying to argue and it's weird because if somebody like me who grew up in Europe it really isn't a stretch I you know I'm used to hearing about political parties during the Cold War who called themselves social and so at least they openly support especially as funny as\nAnd nobody was espousing monsters revolution I Know that wasn't the case here in the U.S if you were a socialist he might as well and it's just been a Soviet spy is like socialism was a political ...\nYeah right I mean even the way Trump use the word today kind of has its genetics and the red scare and the Nineteen fifties in the McCarthy witch hunt so what kind of support the socialism or democratic socialism if they call it that what kind of support as it happened to us right now\nWell I think we'll get some clues from the results in the midterms\nBut there are other indications too I mean for one thing you have people on the right attacking socialism formal frequently than they used to the idea of socialism has become very popular among young people like Ben Shapiro who's a relatively young conservative commentator he was family alive when the Berlin Wall came down\nUnsafe frame socialism as you know the opposite\nOf capitalism capitalism is good because capitalism is freedom socialist daddy's socialism is tyranny not journey socializing yourself is hearing\nAlso Marco there's no organization called the Democratic socialist of America on the eve of Donald Trump's election them membership was less than ten thousands today it stands at more than fifty two thousand you know no big it's growing\nYeah
