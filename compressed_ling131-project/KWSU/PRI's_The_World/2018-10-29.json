do and what our role in is in this in this country the U.S government brings in refugees the U.S government identifies people abroad there are twenty five million refugees around the world\nSixty five million displaced people overall is the highest level in recorded history and the U.S government offers safety to a tiny fraction of those people and then agencies like highest and other national

I went to China is fine as modern poets and an artist who like his son felt the wrath of Chinese authorities\nAfter he passed away I feel you feel you're alone and they don't belong to anybody and uh\nAnd maybe that's a moment you want to act so that's really a psychologically ... parish and for me to become a new ball suffer myself a new boss of yourself yes this is like the godfather fail\nSo I'd like you if you would tell us the story of the preparations for his memorial after your father died in Nineteen Ninety six because the Chinese officials had their own ideas about how that defense should really unfold right\nYes is this the communist society Irish than half a clear\nHierarchy you know so he was a kick out from a Communist Party [noise]\nAnd even he was the same generation is on the state leaders ... mall drawing the line of people\nThey work together but uh but he was heavily criticized author writes has in some way against the party so your father was in that inner circle

how did that memorial first they decided to his body has to be covered by communist flack\nIs very high on there\nAnd that means you're you're part of it is a revolution but I feel ... uncomfortable you know I said you know you should not do something to somebody already passed away which\nIs made against his will so I made that argument that said I don't need to cover is that a flak\nDid they resist yeah they they told me they said to your father doesn't just get onto your family you know which is very good argument they say a recent belongs to the Communist Party or a state was it a

you\nCute or some kind of a stupid ridiculous uh action you see ... to that kind of ... and all the time was your intention to shake up the Chinese public no it's not possible you'll have no path for the rest of society is in deep sleep and they don't care [noise]\nIt was interesting something you said about smashing the vows you felt it was almost like a child acting out and I want to ask you about the middle finger because it's a photographic motif that you've used pointing a finger at the Hong Kong's skyline\nAppointing a middle finger at the Eiffel Tower Chairman Mao I felt like when I saw this it's like a rebellious teenager has just gotten a camera for the first time what is up with the finger\nIs just so sad that survey ... now I realize that don't do that anymore because I'm Me

rights but deeply us also costs and a lot of problem for other people from other nations for broader human rights violations\nI mean I asked partly because you live in Berlin now but I understand you're moving to New York with your family right yes so I Know you've described to us as a country of immigrants which I think a lot of people would agree with but president Donald Trump seems to reject that idea how do you feel about this reality as where I moved\nTo the end of the reality is about how you you as a nation still have power to accept the difference still have an edgy are still

[noise]\nAnd the remains of dead animals are in the soil to not fossilized Bones Are petrified wood to actual stuff\nAnd all of this organic material has a lot of carbon and in fact that's what the word organic means organic chemistry is carbon chemistry so when gates has said the soil has a lot of dead plant in it she means we put our carbon in the freezer\nWe have and now we're unfortunately kind of taking the plug out of the freezer and she saw and so then one permafrost it starts to truly thought then\nBecause my parents are eating it and they are aspiring so they are breathing basically and then they emit carbon micro breath that\nWe have to worry about basically microbes when living things die microbes begin breaking them down and the carbon that was locked up in a blade

scientists are at work around the Arctic studying sites that are wetter or dryer colder or warmers with more or less vegetation\nAnd they're all trying to understand just how quickly these billions of tons of carbon might be released\nThink the the scary part is that we don't know what an extra four degrees of warming will do to this huge amount of carbon drugstore tearing it from [noise] we're trying to you\nTo soil because the whole system is so complex but it's also hard because humans have never won the planet up like we are now we have nothing to compare that to at least from our species perspective wearing what climate scientists call a no analog situation a massive global experiment\nIs not that we're turning on the big Arctic permafrost machine or we don't know what it does [noise] um and until we actually figure out what it does maybe you could do to stop turning off [noise]\nIf you have a warming of one degree that makes all the difference in the world because it gets from frozen to thought and that is something that scientists are really worried about because many ah thresholds that you might cross their uh\n... says that in many parts of the Arctic the permafrost has already thought enough to start emitting carbon in other places the frozen soil is right on the cusp of that to the point where a change of one or two degrees can transform it from being something

from frozen Arctic soil but we do know that every bit of carbon we emit into the atmosphere gets us closer to that point\nScientists call it a positive feedback loop more carbon in the air leads to more warming which leads to the release of more carbon and the process just builds on itself [noise]\nAnother thing we know is that we don't get a second chance at this once our emissions potentially trigger this huge release of carbon we've put ourselves at the mercy of processes that we can't control and that will dramatically reshape the earth's climate and our own civilizations\n[noise] I ask your team if he thought there was any way to stop this experiment we're conducting on the Arctic or if he thought the damage was already done [noise]\nWe have choices [noise] I think especially in the
