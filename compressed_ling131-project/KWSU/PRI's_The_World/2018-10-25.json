that they're spending time with our safe or unsafe whether or not they should be sent to the re education camps to get formal re education or not\nHow are the leaders reacting to this\nFor many many years that I've spoken to have had ... on civilian staying in their homes have told me that they experienced is a pretty extreme form of eternal wisdom kind of in ... station\nThey feel like it's a violation of their personal space and up their family life there particularly concerned with the way that the Han civilians are treating their children their training their children to speak Chinese weaker language is now something that's forbidden in schools\nThey might see their parents has backward which is what they're basically being taught by the state and we were parents feel as though they have no power to stop that sort of activity\nSo how do harm civilians view their roles in his government project\nSo I found a variety of perspectives it's it's complex because there's hon people

extreme way and all speech and action was politicized\nSo there's a lot of concern there from this older group the newer group of people that I met people that I came to the province more recently are

population\nThe way they bring their final solution is lasting stability or long term security\nBut it's quite big we don't know exactly what that looks like it seems as though they're thinking that the whole people for a generation either in the camps or in tight surveillance and then maybe the next generation the young children that are going to these Chinese medium schools now that they'll be
