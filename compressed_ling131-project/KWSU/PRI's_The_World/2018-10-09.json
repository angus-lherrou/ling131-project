to the far end of the earth remote villages in Russia for example but getting intel can also be as easy as going online and doing a few searches\nThe investigative news websites belly cat and the insider did both\nAnd in the process managed to reveal the likely identity a one person allegedly involved in the poisoning of a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k.\nThe suspects name is Dr Alexander Michigan according to the investigation he's a trained military doctor who worked for the G argue Russian Army intelligence\nEric told her as one of the building cat reporters who worked on this case you went through a pretty a lengthy process to identify Alexander Michigan what clues did you actually have to work with\nWhat we had a little bit to start with just from the information that Russia had released and also the British authorities had released about the cover identities that this guy\nSo we now know his real name is Alex ... before he was ... he was known as Alex hundred Petra which was his coverage and it says you know totally fake identity they made up out of nowhere for him to travel under um and so we had some information about that cover identity including his birthday um where he had to pass passport issue too which is very small town in the middle of nowhere\nI'm In northern Russia so that was a good starting point\nSo talk a bit more about that process how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there\nSo we have the starting point if we can assume that he probably\nUse some of the same information is cover identity from his real I get so we looked into a bunch of databases some of them are openly available some of them are late um Russia is a very corrupt and leaky society and because of that there's leaked databases\nFrom driver's licenses and insurance stuff and voter registration an address in all over the Internet you can find if you use now where to look cross reference everything we could find and we found him ... about a guy named Alex in our ... at the same birth date and ... the same delegate middle of nowhere\nAnd northern Russia and after a bunch of digging including actually sending someone to go to this tiny little deli craze from and finding locals who knew him apparently he was a local DJ on before he goes well medical school\nYeah he was he a DJ at the local club the one club I'm sure they had in a tiny village so we once these hunters in these databases cross referencing the tiny bit of information we\nYou and your investigators are really seemed to have to put your cells in the mindset of a spy\nAway I mean a lot of this is just a lot of very creative thinking thinking of um any vulnerabilities of what would leave a paper trail from a spy on Russia so\nYou know maybe not you can't find his birth certificate right because maybe that's all the information is hidden away forever but again these guys have real lives to they have a family they have kids so you can find information that would track back to them\nSo yeah I mean yes maybe some of this is kind of spy work but it was very very basic routine research on this stuff you learn and you know high school or college or you know searching looking for an interesting details in cross referencing them and see what's on your matches up\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander mission like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the Kremlin\n[laughter] yeah I mean this guy is listed his registered addresses as the headquarters of the cherry which when first glance seems absolutely insane like why would a secret spy list his public address\nLike on his driver's license to address the you know ... the equivalent of the CIA [noise] well he did it because uh you know if he gets pulled over in his car the cop pulled up the address and he sees the address of the you know the Russian CIA more or less and he's like oh actually you know everything's me up and up you can just go you know\nYou're fine so um that we ran the address I'm at a traffic database we found there's three hundred and five men all between the ages of twenty five and fifty all had the same registered address or just this one address in Moscow so all of these men almost certainly are often you that you are you\nAnd they all listed their vehicle registration I just address who they just don't want to be a traffic fines and they get pulled over or they get pulled over drunk driving or speeding the cop to let them go right because they don't want to mess with somebody in the intelligence services so really everything just goes down to laziness and I guess corruption in a way to 'em and that's how ... how are you able to research this um played out\nSo the headline in the guardian on this news and treat me it said a string of own goals by Russian Spies exposes a strange sloppy and as to what is your take on the possibility that this was not sloppy and his butt intentional that Russia want it to leak who these men were\nI mean I suppose I always possible right because you know every time any investigation permission and Russia people always chime in and saying well they wanted you to find it very well if they want us to find a wise no one published this stuff before because you know these insurance registration for these vehicles that your your headquarters\nYou know they've been doing this for years and years and years and years and registering new agencies address same like jury you address it again it makes no sense when you think about it but it all kind of boils down to again just corruption in laziness\nPoisoning I have authorities and the u._k. or anywhere else been in touch with you about your

they discovered this all weeks and weeks ago or maybe in this all completely news then we honestly have no idea\nYou know just listening to what you said about all the available data that is on line it is it impossible to be a spy and the digital age\nIt depends I I again I don't know if I have no idea I've never worked in the intelligence services but I'm sure you can do it in some ways but it's
