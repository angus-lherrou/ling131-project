S.\nAre you talking about the largest economy in the world so it's natural that a lot of my time or we'll have some kind of relationship with our actions taken by the United states also because an accent that it's taken by the United states has repercussions are everywhere\nAre across the world so anything that the U.S does will have a a global systemic effect so of course a lot of my time has to do with that but what is important also you have to realize that President Trump didn't just happen\nYou know he didn't just you know\nFall from the sky in an ambient that was a a north gripe and then found a direction that didn't that that was not there he is\nThe result of a very real a situation in American society and in the American economy and or if you don't understand the forces that put him there I think that's\nPart of getting the wrong diagnosis\nAnd I have to tell you there's a lot of sympathy for some things that are said uh owned a part of the United states that are welcome in other areas of the world but not every single forced\nThe WTO as opposed to terrorists generally and most economists agree that terrorists are\nTariffs exists under a different name one of the U.S is the biggest complaints is that China for instance doesn't honor intellectual property that\nRather than being bought or license the properties copied so that would essentially be a tariff on the imported version then their their governments that subsidize their airline industries or their agricultural industries are oil and gas in sugar\nYou the WTO have any ability to direct totally request or command that these are terrorists not by name but in essence be eliminated\nAbsolutely happens all the time industries like protection\nThey want to be supported by the government they want to get help and they are now seen this um a prize in what we call behind the border protection\nA and that happens in the form of a technical barriers it happens in the form of a insufficient enforcement of certain rules like you mentioned intellectual property and that's much more difficult to assess because terrorists you can measure\nThe Arabs you include audio spreadsheet and you'll prepare for it to pay that additional cost\nA behind the board there measure you don't know when they come to know what form they would take so it's it's stuff we have a committees are hearing the W. to discuss exactly that\nDo you have any sense if you had to estimate the size of those ... what they would be compared to the official tariff rates\nThan not really a also because some of those are perfectly legal you would see some countries are a put it in place a technical barriers or technical standards that are more demanding\nThen or what other countries apply and that would be for the protection of the consumer or it could be for preventive measures and those things are difficult to measure but they can be very significant definitely uh in several situations they just stopped trade altogether\nSo that's ah whatever and infinite ... at the border measure than\n[noise] the WTO says the average tariff rate among its members fell by Fifteen Percent between the organization founding in Nineteen Ninety five and two thousand Thirteen [noise]\nThere are however many Katherine Harris rules are less stringent for developing countries for instance for them\nMinister he soon to be unfair or just an power the NAFTA the U.S Canada Mexico free trade treaty was signed a year before the WTO came into existence President Trump was not a fan of NAFTA [noise]\nHave long contended that NAFTA\nWas perhaps the worst trade deal ever may [noise]\nSo he decided to tear it apart and put it back together again [noise] the new term which address the auto dairy and other industries are more to his like\nIn the um the proper parameters of WTO behavior\nTo be Frank with you I don't have to try very hard they reach out for me very quickly sometimes I Try to discourage a some courses of action\nBut I also have to understand the political sensitivities in in many of these players we have um I'm happy to see\nA conversations which are very open very Frank and um of course I can share with you and the listeners or the content of those conversations but\nAre they are very very Frank and uh we explore all kinds of options are before us I tell them about the importance\nOf the system and not to compromise the system and I would say that pretty much everybody I talked to us tells me that the system must be preserved even strengthen\nBut it's not easy under these circumstances to be you know do in the line when others aren't\nComing up after the break with\nThe head of the WTO on our show of course we're going to ask him to make some predictions about trade and the economy my crystal ball doesn't allow me to go that far\nOh well but don't worry Roberto as a veto has plenty more to say we'll hear it after the break [noise]\nFreakonomics radio is supported by target preventing future at

...\nRoberto Acevedo director general of the world Trade Organization was appointed to the post into thousands Thirteen when the train waters were considerably less choppy than they are today [noise]\nSo you are from Brazil and you've studied electrical engineering before becoming a diplomat I'd like to just very quickly here had those three factors Brazilian engineering\nAnd being a career diplomat how they inform your role as director general of the WTO Brazilian um well the good thing about being a\nA Brazilian is that it gives me a very diverse prospective Brazil has a is a big economy a it's a big country with several ethnicities\nA very diverse cultural backgrounds and it has aspect of a a developed nation\nA very sophisticated industry but also has important uh aspects of of developing country very social challenges and that gives me this different perspective engineer\nI was always good with numbers then I think it was natural for me to become an engineer and it was\nUntil I met my wife ah and ah she decided to get into the diplomatic career and I'm at that point in time I had to decide you know ... what would I Do an engineer married to a diplomatic was going to be pretty challenging especially when she was\nPosted abroad so I thought you know what let's let's\nWork for the family so I took the um\nA love story in its own rights can you give\nMe a quick example of an engineering like solution to a trade or economic problem\nSo and I'm In a meeting or something like that I Try to understand the basic motivations in and then figure out a way to make a those motivations were together\nAnd that's something I think that engineers do to try to get very complex situation some problems [noise] try to reduce them to derail a mental a cost effective ports\nAnd a figure out a way to make them work personal chemistry is very important as well even between negotiators are I Know some people think that everything you need to know you learn in kindergarten and I think that's\nThat is quite accurate but uh I I found out that you're forever learning how to re ... relate to people how to take into account as diverse personalities cultures objectives\nSo as long as the world still has um independent nations and it seems that will be the case released another few decades that we're not becoming one big global nation it strikes me that there is an inherent friction around and trade 'em in which\nEvery country has to strike a balance between protectionism and globalism and so I'm curious whether you agree or disagree with this notion and however you answer what's to be done about that\nThis tension um that exists or even today are with regard to trade it always existed countries that do trade and that have ah a cooperative relationship with other partners they essentially gain from that\nBut it is also a reality that when you trade some sectors in the domestic economy or will lose many gain a mini are better off with the with the trading relationship but that some lose in the sense that they're not competitive enough\nSometimes the factories closed or in particular sector and ah you cannot ignore that I think\nWhat you see today is something different from this very traditional very a historic tension\nToday we are seeing a transformation of the economic structure of the global economy Web producing things differently ... ...\nBefore and this is increasing\nNow clearly even for the government send for politicians\nIt is easier to blame you know the foreign for these problems which are happening inside their own economies it's easier to blame the the imports are for the loss of jobs when they arm or they have a role of course Madame minor in this structural change\nAnd I think if we don't realize that if we don't try to find a solution for this will be hurting much more than the help it\nOkay so you've just described I Would argue beautifully in succinctly a big problem that of course a lot of economists and some others have described but you're right that's not the political rhetoric\nSo it's easy to think of what the wrong medicine how involved is the WTO in trying to discover and administer the right medicine\nI think that number two is already at least trying to help governments and public opinion to understand uh the situation and reach the right diagnosis if we get the wrong diagnosis who get definitely the wrong medicine the important thing to understand is that whatever medicine we choose it's not going to work overnight\nThere is no quick fix for this this is a this is essentially something akin to the industrial revolution so there will be a need to rethink the whole educational system in countries\nHow to support the displaced are people are those who lost their jobs but cannot find a job somewhere else in the economy how old are you will help them\nFind other economic activity that will work for them and to help them support their family and the state of course I and I I understand that people don't want this I myself have very strong reservations against a a big state\nBy state at least think about this and think about the mechanisms that will allow a U.S to to handle these are displaced a masters of workers [noise]\nSo I wouldn't say that my pop economic was through Marxism but it was through reading some very inspirational economists which one was definitely call them are\nThat's Mary on amongst the Cato I'm a professor and the economics of innovation I'm public value at University College London\nYou also advised as far as I can tell a number of governments and governmental institutions\nStores I'm currently on the council of economic advisors for the first minister Scotland [laughter] I'm all for the special adviser for a couple of months\nI should their research commissioner and the European Union and I used to be\nOn the advisory board to offer Jeremy I'm ...\nAnd I resigned because of breath [noise]\nIts share a special advisor to the secretary general of the CD is that right [noise] yeah so the city is currently rethinking its economic narrative and\nSo they have a group that's literally called called that the new economic narrative and I'm One of the people on that\nGotcha and also um citrus advisory panel in Finland is that\nYeah probably I don't really is one of the whole and yes [laughter]\nIt's actually even like thirty more [noise]\nFor a clue let's get back to why months of Cato found such inspiration in Carl Marx\nOne thing that's fascinating about Martin says that he's known as a critic of capitalism\nActually when you read capital volume one two and three you end up really admiring and appreciating the dynamic aspect of capitalism which is technological change\nWe shouldn't forget that futile if I'm with five hundred years of inertia one of the defining features of capitalism is in fact the way the innovation has really broken down all sorts of law that it's constantly changing how industries operate how production distribution and consumption work and mark really talks about that\nQuite curious that one of the you know must have its critics of capitalism actually described it and the most dynamic of always knocks what got me interested in economics of technological change\nBut it's not just technological change interest not to cut out she has a relatively radical stance on the value that's created by technological change what do I mean by radical stamps\nConsider the titles of her book the first was called the entrepreneurial state [noise] those two words entrepreneurial and state typically are not used to gather lots of cut his latest book is called the value of everything making taking in the global economy\nWhen it comes to the relationship between government and economic growth Martha ... who knows how the popular or just goes\nIt goes like this [noise] my God the government what a basket case group of aircraft they don't know what they're doing\nBut she sees it differently you know what would be without a GPS\nPublicly financed what would Google be without the Internet publicly financed [noise]\n... was born in Rome but grew up in Princeton New Jersey where her father took a job as a research businesses to at the university\nShe studied history and international relations at tough and got her PHD in economics at the new school for social research in New York now she lives with her family in London\nIn an interview with the Financial Times I'm lunch with the F T uh where you go and have lunch and a glass of wine you said a very expensive restaurants [noise] and I saw that the glass of wine you ordered costs forty pounds\nMade an error they made an error you know I didn't write this time they said no no they tricky they trick you I don't know if it's because I was a woman and they did a show me the price you know today gentlemen or if it's but that she does but there is no price\nThat got anyone who read that article at the call me a Soviet ... social\n[laughter] right so to someone who says you know free markets are\nAlmost always good and governments are almost always bad with someone who says that you say what\nThe first says what do you mean by the free market and it's curious if you read Adam Smith a you know a a\nOne of the first economists I can uh late Seventeen hundred he actually meant by the word free market not free from the state but free from rent seeking free from those activities that extract value so what I say to those who say that you know we need less state\nI'm uh in order to be more innovative more dynamic I say well let's look at one of the most innovative part of the U.S economy which is Silicon Valley did that come from the free market or from an active uh there's a little hand or the state\nMy point is actually the stage with involved in almost everything a Silicon Valley not to exclude the role of the private sector of course we all know the very important ah companies in that area but\nThe role that public after it's played was really across the whole innovation chain\nSo you're talking about agency news like dark but NASA and the national institutes of health and so on yes\nExactly I'm Talking about\nBoth agencies that do basic research like the national Science Foundation but also a agencies more downstream doing applied research\nLike a dark by middle sister organization in more recent times called our thing ie the national institutes of health which continued to spend more than thirty billion dollars a year and the most radical uncertain high rent a research\nThere's some evidence of the government funding that Mexico is talking about DARPA or the defense advanced research Projects Agency\nCreated during the Cold War to keep American technology ahead of the Soviet\nIs over the years produce several kinds of missiles and airplanes as well as the first computer mouse miniature GPS receivers H. D. displays and the digital personal assistant ARPA e or the advanced research Projects Agency for energy founded under George W Bush\nHas funded a variety of energy projects including battery storage tech\nThe department of energy starting in Nineteen Seventy eight invested more than a hundred and thirty million dollars studying\nTo help fund the vast majority of all new drugs approved\nBy the CIA [noise] need public institutions have absolutely co created value\nIt's quite extraordinary that we've become very used to these kind of much more passive words to describe the state you start having to change the copy Larry\nOn that when you are so instead of saying the public sector deem risks the private sector is actually about sharing risks instead of talking about just ... and enabling business it's really about you know taking on the lead investor rule with an investor first resort\nOne of the central arguments you make is that government institutions and closet government institutions are involved in the investment are involved in the risk and yet you argue barely share in the return how big of a problem is that\nSo it's a huge problem and it comes back how we talk about things I often remind people um you know play tell that story teller ruled the world so these stories that we tell about who creates value has in fact created the stories that are that justify the extraction\nOf value so let me give you an example which I think brings home the U.S government after the crisis decided to have a proper fiscal stimulus program of close to eight hundred billion dollars and part of that agenda\nWas really also to direct that physical stimulus towards the green economy so you might remember that Obama\nFinance some companies like a cylinder through the U.S department of energy through a guaranteed loans that was for about five hundred million and that company went by\nSo new questions about a cornerstone of stimulus won five hundred and thirty five million dollar loan to a company called ... that makes solar energy panels what is the taxpayer has to be the one footing the bill to try to shift on power solar power worse people said\nMy God the government would a basket case group of bureaucrats they don't know what they're doing they shouldn't be picking winners they should just really do this kind of facilitating rolls of you know construct some roads education infrastructure and then get out of the way\nOn which first of all completely misses the point that actually the U.S government in terms of energy has been the lead finance or\nOf areas like solar and wind alongside other governments but also nuclear fracking itself came out of that a U.S government financing early on but more\nA very similar amount of money so they passed last car got a four hundred and sixty five million guaranteed loans\nAnd when I say guaranteed I'm Talking about guaranteed by the U.S taxpayer the when cylinder Olin by the taxpayers we're\nPretty angry that they had to pick up the bill but why did the taxpayers not know that they had also finance ... would not have changed the narrative and the perception of what these bureaucrats in Washington were doing they actually had a portfolio like any venture capitalists which takes on risk and so\nTo speak to any a venture capitalist they will tell you that for every success\nThere's many failures however\nIf you really want to be a venture capital you have to construct your portfolio in such a way that you also get some of the upside from the wind precisely to cover that downside", "show_name": "Freakonomics Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "28"}
