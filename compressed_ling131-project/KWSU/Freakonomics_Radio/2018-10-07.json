telling your second grade daughter that's just move next week the fight started and I hit her as hard as I said and she actually fell down I have an eight year old son there's no way a lot of time [noise]\nMaybe you are an obsessive sports fan the war they'd be more casual fan and you follow just a couple of sports teams or maybe pay no attention to sports and you only see it when the Olympics are on somebody else's TV [noise] whichever the case when you do see those athletes\nIt's easy to think of them as existing solely in that context\nAs a full grown adult\nWearing a uniform performing under extraordinary pressure focused on highly specialized task has zero to do with daily life for at least your daily life but is that who those people really are I think it's so good at this thing they do\nWhen you see them on TV all you're seeing the outcomes but what were the input we understand that elite athletes represents some magical combination of talent and determination but what about say look you know my gosh\nI I yes absolutely I think the best of luck involved\nBut Shawn Johnson than American gymnast to one limping gold medal and many other top honors\nI like this miracle math equation half a equal the perfect answer I mean you can't get hurt and you have to be healthy you can't have the flu on the wrong day\nWhen you get all the people who fit that equation not laughter as many people I guess I was just the best of the very few and fit that equation and today I'm\nThinking I'm radio the third installment in the series we're calling the hidden inside of sports in the first episode we looked at how sports have always mirrored society from our historical penchant for war colonizing the two or more recent obsession with pushing the limits of human achievement\n\nIn episode two we looked at the economic of a single NFL franchise to San Francisco forty niners and how they have a gun to recover from a debilitating losing streak\nI Know when you lose a game a lot of noise happens when you lose to a ton happens usually trees like Armageddon\nI'm trying not to today's episode becoming an athlete\nTime to step back and try to understand how these people rose to such heightened how scientific is the process how predictable\nWill look at a number of factors including of course Ron talent my parents are both superstar athletes will look it will be determination I did a bunch of push ups and sit ups that night until I was I'm throwing up\nAnd the mental aspect of this most physical pursuits ...\nWell I think the mind is\nIs as big of a separate or um for professional athletes as any physical tools will hear stories of opportunities gained and loss\nIn Nineteen eighty one it was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand eight teams seven point eight per se and we'll hear one story almost too good to be ...\nThey said hey you are blowing up on Twitter you're going to grab you know your everywhere and you just have no idea [noise]\n\nThen his freakonomics radio show that explores bank didn't die of everything [noise] here's your house even [noise]\nWhen you see an elite performer in any field sport or music or surgery whatever it's\nWhich is attributable to hard work can practice this is a debate that's been going on probably forever nature versus nurture raw talent versus what's called deliberate practice\nWe've had that debate on this program most recently in episode called how to become a great at just about anything too often this debate ends up obscuring what strikes me as a pretty obvious fact come great at anything\nNeed both talent in practice lots of each but\nEven that fact seems pretty narrow don't you think because athletic success like any success in life or any failure it's what you might call multi factorial [noise]\nA lot of input from a lot of variables\nImagine you've got to athletes with identical talent levels and identical training methods you really want to make a big bet that their athletic careers also ended up identical\nAs much as we might want to turn the pursuit of success in to science into a recipe real life is more nuanced than that\nAlso for interesting [noise] so I mean [noise]\nJay Z\nSold drugs grew up in March the projects to a single mother\nThat's Dominique Fox worth who played six seasons in the NFL\nNow he is a multi multi millionaire married to beyond say the most amazing talent we have today\nSo why don't we set it up so that all\nYoung men must sell drugs when barricades and um and have only their mother and grow up in a Marcy projects in Brooklyn New York like I I mean\nShe had a great talent and to be honest like there's probably a a great deal of luck like\nHe happened to not be there when one of his friends got arrested and his friend in snitch on them like that is like a lot of luck\nAnd that to me and I think the same thing is true for me like I can go through the course of my life and look at all the things that happened that were just happenstance that led me to these positions and I'm not going to say that it's a model that should\nBe that should be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that seems crazy so okay\nNot going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but we'll do our best to describe some of the ...\nLearn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age ... to share a for instance a three time major league baseball all star\nYes you are and most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athletes are going to be the best get on your team\nYou know I've played every sport as a kid was baseball your best sports in the ... always while yes ah and I actually enjoy playing basketball more uh I play backyard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport for my future\nAthletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits passed from parent to child\nIn super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist these let it we performed a rough\nCalculations showing that if a major league baseball player has a son that boy is about a hundred times more likely than a random boy also make the majors\nSo it may not surprise you that a lot of the athletes we've been interviewing for the series came from athletic families here's Kerry Welsh Jennings who's won three Olympic gold medals in ...\nOh man well my ... my life has literally been family and sports like from day one I think from birth and my parents are both super than the athletes they both come from very athletic family\nMy parents are both athletic\nAnd that's the alpine skier McHale is Schiff friend who's won two Olympic gold medals\nMy mom is extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgery and then hand surgeries and neck surgery and everything but she still such an incredible athlete\nWell I mean my dad kind of did every sport when he was growing up\nAnd the gold medal gymnasts Shawn Johnson\nHe was a hockey player he wrestled he did BMX have in a race NATO acts I mean everything\nJust how powerful is the sports gene David Epstein is a science journalist and author of a book called the sports gene in it he tells the story of a man named Donald Thomas Donald or is about\nSix to I'm leaving a ... guy\nThomas played basketball at small college in Missouri but he was far from an elite player and the college program was far from elite one day in the gym he was bragging about how high you could jump\nAnd the best jumper on the track team a guy named Carlos overheard him and said you know you're talking all that trash um\nThey go out to the track and Carlos sets the high jump bar\nSixty six inches Donald still wearing his basketball sneakers runs up jumps clears easily Carlos move the bar higher and higher Donald keeps clearing it\nAnd I can't say I thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think is you want your kids\nExistence and the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten\nHave fencing thing the only exception being my own university University of Chicago\nAnd each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill\nThere's three different blade says ... soil and there's male female fancy\nAnd given that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers\nSo it's something like six or seven percent of the kids who ever tried to be sensors end up being college ... about saying they get scholarships but that they're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing\nHow much does limit sink fencing increases your chances from that point four percent based find\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything off constant something like Fifteen fold\nWe should say here that college admissions being what they are fencing doesn't necessarily increase your Kansas all that much your grades would soon to be very very good to get into those top schools that said as an admission sweetener how does ... think fencing compares to other sports\nMy God if you want to go to an Ivy League school\nFor kid about soccer and basketball and football there's something like three hundred thousand kids playing high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be taught soccer players but that the chance of having soccer be your vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing\nTurns out to be about Seventy five or eighty times harder so how many of your kids if you turn to defense or is that it actually won and us so far so good uh I I couldn't really turned him into a fence or uh he he strangely enough gravitated towards fencing when he was about nine years old\nAnd he fences at a really good club in Chicago and I don't know his grades aren't that good\nSo you know I Know as everyone else knows if he's going to go to an Ivy League school it's going to be because of fencing [noise]\nComing up on freakonomics radio the story of an athlete who did go to an Ivy League school but then when it's time to go pro that apparently counted against him if he had played\nAt Kentucky or do you would have

as\nWe've been hearing there are a lot of input that go into the production of an elite athlete in Palin's drives the right kind of practice maybe the parent or to to get you to the ring the gym or the track and five AM and as John Johnson told us earlier he might need some luck\nI mean when you can't get hurt you can't have the\nBut my coaches so how'd that happen it was kind of the freak\nOccurrence coach was Chinese born and raised Chinese um when he was three years old he was taken away from his family and raised to be an Olympic gymnast\nAnd he kind of had this crazy career that I Would say almost traumatized him he he lost his childhood he looked kind of lost his family and so when he was Twenty one years old he actually left to China\nCame to the United states open to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa of all places and\nHad this dream this American Dream to raise an Olympian or Olympians there were also children and how to balance in life and were you know fun loving and had a\nTrue childhood Johnson had started her training at different gym\nAnd I loved it it was awesome but child my coach that took me too I'm backs open up a gym about five minutes from my parents' house and my parents ended up switching they had to save gas money and I was\nReally really blessed to fall under his his guidance and his coaching I mean I I was a very very fortunate child's within the gymnastics community to have\nVery loving very very protective people around me and he I mean given today's society I can thankfully and\nSay that he he kept me said and I am forever grateful for that [noise] oh\nShawn Johnson is good luck created good opportunities which she worked hard to parlay into an Olympic gold medal but what about the young athletes who don't get the right opportunities whether to bad luck more through something much more concrete like lack of money\nOver the past decade the youth sports economy doubles more than Fifteen billion dollars a year\nAnd a lot of youth sports involves some sort of pay to play model\nPay to play something that's just it just scares me because it's become so much of a business of itself and less about true true true development\nThat's Brandon McCarthy you spend a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen [noise] it's\nA tournament in California this we go next week and you go about it after that it's Texas and I don't understand though two working parents could ever afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\nYou you know the theme of economics last like ten or Fifteen Years has been income inequality and\nNear ... all the way down the line yes\nI Would think so I mean there's two players on your team and one player I'm at the age Thirteen level can make all the tournaments in the summer and one can only make to the tournaments well how much playing time as the player who whose family can't afford for him to go all those trips and then the coach doesn't favor having play um [noise]\nI think this that trickle down effect from there and there's less access to the top coaching lessons equipment you name it over time it's starting to pirates off out as some income inequality just creates better baseball player that horse baseball players\nOr in one way or the instance a huge drop in baseball players\nIn Nineteen eighty one there was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand Eighteen seven point eight percent so the question is why the decline\nDavid Canton is a history professor and director of the Africana studies program at Connecticut College\nThe huge drop of black players in baseball he argues has a number of historical causes including the relative rise of black football and basketball players but he puts most of the blame on deeper structural issues\nSo I look at these factors the industrialization\nMass incarceration as suburbanization so at the industrialization lack of tax base we know there's no funds to what construct and maintain ball fields\nSo you see the rapid decline of the physical space in the Bronx in Chicago and other uh urban areas which leads to a lack of participation\nAnd then in college I wanted to be a ... computer science major at um University of Maryland\nAnd my academic advisor was I can\nDo that that core slows gonna make it very difficult for you to make it to our practices their labs and blah blah blah blah so I was like not not going to do that\nSo instead you did was it American studies at American studies when journalism ... which just shows how easy would I Do is that you could do it and another major while playing football [laughter] no I um\nI enjoy those and it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready\nFor football and I\nSay I want to say once I got to the league and I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you were given up through the course of your life

for a few years she still feeling the after effects of single minded [noise]\nMy my whole life since I was a kid I had a very clear goal and I work towards that goal and I made lots of decisions that would give me close to that goal but give me further away from other important and interesting things including friends including family\nThe state of transition his transition included getting an MBA from Harvard and working at the NBA players union he's now doing some writing and sports casting I mean I think it's that\nFeeling of loneliness honestly which\nAnd it's not like I have three kids and my wife and I'm not like alone obviously and I love them and I have fun with them and but throughout my life I have been almost myopic Lee focused on a goal which\nBeing focused on that goal like gave me purpose and\nI'm sure I'm going to butcher the nature you quote but if something to the effect of a when a man has a why he can bear almost anyhow and like I was\nDidn't I don't drink now I never drank in my life I never smoke we like I was single focus on doing everything every decision I made with like All right I'm going to get closer to go and I I\n... the people I was close with in high school like those are my friends any more people I was close with in college like not really my friends anymore and then at thirty five I'm In DC where my wife has\nA bunch of family and friends friends that she's been close with since they weren't in second grade and like and I'm\nI don't really have that and like I was making these choices\nAh which I thought were choices to get me what you wanted right and I didn't realize at the time that I was for going like lasting long lasting relationship [noise]\nComing up after the break what does it set you back if you pursue the athletic dream
