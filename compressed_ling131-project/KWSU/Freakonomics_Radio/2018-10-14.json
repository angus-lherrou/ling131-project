[noise]\n\nIf you happen to live in New York City that I Do there's a name it's been routinely popping up for a few decades now always attached to interesting and\nOften controversial project shirt 'em Dan doctor off\nBut don't worry if you haven't heard of doctor off he's not quite a household name\nBut his fingerprints are all over the biggest city in the United states [noise] grew up in Michigan became a New Yorker quite reluctantly it just wasn't his kind of place but he settled in\nIn his wife started raising their family here he worked in investment banking and private equity seemingly just another money harvester from the provinces finds the urban riches too good to pass up this went on for years\nAnd along the way I came up with this crazy idea that New York hot to host the Olympics\nAnd a eventually that that idea became a bit of a movement or it drew the attention of Mike Bloomberg what the time was just an ordinary billionaire and uh I don't think would have been seriously thinking about running for mayor but he joined our board gave some money\nMichael Bloomberg wasn't seriously thinking about running for mayor much less being there which says you may know also describes the arc of our current president Donald Trump's run for president apparently started out as a means of enlarging the Trump brand\nBloomberg's run for mayor of New York city was apparently his way of enlarging Bloomberg LP the financial information company that made him rich\nBut voters well voters are funny animals Bloomberg laws short on charm at a certain appeal smart self made fiercely pragmatic he spoke his mind often to the detriment of the people he was speaking about\nHe was the opposite of a career politician and then the twin towers were obliterate\nNew York's one hundred and ... mayor now Bloomberg a political neophyte facing a recovery of unknown dimensions invited some other neophyte to help\nAnd when he unexpectedly one right after nine eleven or he asked me to join him in city hall and so I became deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding\nDan doctor off did that job for six years\nHe asked me to go run his company which I did for seven years Bloomberg I'll pay\nWhen Bloomberg was finally done being mayor into thousands Thirteen after squeezing out a third term despite pre existing two term limit he considered running for president you considered some other things too but then to the surprise of many he went back to Bloomberg LP\nAnd when he decided he wanted to come back to the company I laughed and do all you know with a tremendous relationship with him but decided I just didn't wanna go back to being his deputy mayor anymore and formed a company with Google or called sidewalk labs\nAnd that's where a doctor off can be found today a CEO of sidewalk labs whose mission is\nOur mission is really to use technology to redefine urban life and the twenty first century and we want to do it by literally building or a city or a district of a city and we have chosen Toronto to do that\nOkay let's back up to before than Dr off was unknown [noise]\nSo you were for many years obsessed with the idea of bringing the Olympics the summer Olympics to New York city and Utah soiled first in obscurity for a while spending a lot of your own money\nA recruiting a lot of people to your cause you you got some leverage over time you got in the Bloomberg administration you were first reluctant to take that job because he thought it would curtail your limping activity but Mike Bloomberg persuade you that it actually would give you leverage\nOr you've got delayed you wanted to be two thousand they had got pushed to two thousand twelve Olympics\nUm you pursued you pursue you pursue you traveled the world did everything you could finally you were a New York was voted the U.S a city in the bed\nAnd then um ultimately lost out in the in the Iowa seeing the international Olympic Committee vote\nSounds pretty nutty doesn't it\nYou know I don't mean to be dismissive of the Olympics themselves but was the Olympic bid on some level\nI came here or not and is it possible that New York perhaps benefited more from the bid for the Olympics and all the infrastructure and related benefits that have produced then it would have benefited from actually hosting it\n[noise] I wouldn't describe it as a stalking horse I Would just say that that was always part of a strategy that it was sort of the off ramp from the strategy that\nYou know the Olympics could be the catalyst to getting things done that people have been talking about for generations but never were able to muster the political will or financial resources to actually do and you could look at successful examples in the past\nAs to how they use the deadlines at the bidding for the Olympics were more likely hosting the Olympics\nCreated sort of an imperative in a city of Tokyo in Nineteen sixty four built the subway system around it\nYou know Barcelona in Nineteen Ninety two did an amazing job of recovering from being a stepchild of dread under Franco for decades and revitalizing the city\nYou're leaving out that the counter examples like Athens but I mean it's not quite the science of what kind of region will benefit\nFrom it all depends on the planning and it depends on the economic resources and other things but I convinced myself that we're in New York was in its development cycle having that kind of catalyst to be a really important thing and we use the deadline of the Olympic decision\nTo get massive region owning done in time et cetera et cetera\nNow the second question you asked was or we better off having now one and there I think the answer is no because I think we could have used another seven years of deadlines to get more stuff done for ...\nSubway today if we can well right now\nI think that might have had a real impact right we could have argued look all these people are coming I think it could have been a deadline to getting for example congestion pricing done but at the end of the day you know much of what we wanted to do as part of the Olympic plan and that was ... developing the waterfront\nYou know in Brooklyn or queens or the whole west side of Manhattan or the high line or regeneration in Coney Island in\nHarlem and flushing areas that have been largely ignored for a long period of time got a big boost from the fact that we bid for the Olympics\nI Love you to give me Dan in just a minute or two what you would consider\nArea I think we fundamentally redefined the economy and land use of New York\nKeep listening for more freakonomics [noise]\n\n[noise]\nIt is it's freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\nDr off started here in New York City life as just another banker and then got obsessed with bringing the Olympics to New York who then joined the Bloomberg administration\nThe dream to dramatically reshape the New York that exists today\nOne of his project at the moment is a new cultural center on the west side of Manhattan called the shed a witch doctor often chairman president [noise]\nShed I'm just curious about the the white and\nHe said why did New York city need another arts complex you I understand are not exactly a a performing arts beamed at least [laughter]\n[noise] yeah well the origin of it actually dates back to when we re planned the west side of Manhattan which we did and in two separate parts one part of it was in West Chelsea and the core of it was to save the high line\nThe second part was to uh build what's called Hudson Yards which is this area on the far west side of Manhattan and uh we decided at the intersection of the high line in Hudson Yards we wanted to have a cultural institution\nWe set to standards for one it should be unlike anything else in New York which is hard because there's twelve hundred cultural institutions in New York\nAnd secondly that it should play a role in keeping New York on the leading edge culturally in the world\nAnd so we eventually had an insight about the role of technology and the role that it's playing and reshaping the cultural ecosystem that led us to conclude that what New York needed was a completely different kind of institution one that would be the most flexible both pro grammatically a and physically\nRight so this is a building that kind of can be recon figure like a transformer or something yes\nIt's exactly right it's like a transformer it's really remarkable the buildings literally moods are and it will open up a in March twenty ninth is what we're targeting two thousand Nineteen and it may be one of the largest cultural start ups of all time\nAnd the c._e._o. phoning Alex ... ah ran for many years in Manchester international festival which again is unusual in that it takes place or took place at least all over the city not in set theaters [noise]\nFrom what I can gather the sheds seems to be a sort of um you know professionalized gorilla operation in a way right it's got a lot of the experimental ism of the experimental arts movement with kind of the the juice and leverage of a big city like New York\nA great way of saying you know another way of expressing it say cultural festival every day because there's multiple spaces that can be recon figured that can accommodate\nIn fact the culture or whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you cannot plan\nTo the detail or even sort of the gross level what's gonna happen in the future instead what you can do is create the infrastructure that might be physical it might be digital might be some ground rules et cetera\nThat enable people to project their own ideas and innovations onto it as taste technologies trends begin to change\nI think that is a very different notion of a cultural institution as well as city building\nI find it and I mean zero disrespect by this but I find it interesting that of all the things that attracts people to New York city these days outsiders visitors\nThe high line is among the most popular it was proposed to be turned into this you know public park and strolling area and you are not a big supporter of it not that you are so hard against it\nBut it's just a striking reminder illustration I guess to me at\nYou and your folks around you who are obviously doing the central infrastructure planning you couldn't have possibly predicted that something like that and his humble and the high line for God's sake and it's an abandoned freight line would turn into this thing that has so much appeal I'm just curious what kind of lesson that taught you know\nWhen I came into city hall um the high line was really one court decision away from being torn down and the Giuliani administration which had proceeded us what's really intent\nOn ripping it down because the landowners who own land under the high line really were really pressuring the Giuliani administration to get rid of it\nAnd you know there were some of us in the administration and immediately saw what the two young guys who would basically kept it alive saw which is that this could be a beautiful park and a manatee\nI Will confess I didn't see that right away um but the key point is is that you know you seize opportunities as you see them and as they evolve and if you're flexible enough to do that then ultimately you can create something that might be amazing\nI mean the the paradox and that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government is it\nWell it generally is not because\nExtraordinary effort a but it should be a on some level a hallmark of government at the same time you have to have a sense for what you want to do and so you have to\nCombine sort of this openness with a determination to get things done or else nothing ever happens you know one of the principles that we always operated with is that look we're competitive entity in New York and whether we were competing with\nLondon or Los Angeles or New Jersey city to be honest you know we can't make policy that puts us at a competitive disadvantage\nLet me ask you about that competition between whether it's far away cities are are near a city you and the Bloomberg administration made it a point to change policy and stop throwing a lot of money at firms are institutions that threatened to leave the using that kind of standard financial incentive\nBut I'm curious what effect that zero sum competition has on each area because\nYou know in some dimensions I'd imagine the competition is healthy right on the other hand firms and institutions can end do game the system and basically skim a bunch of taxpayer money for their own purposes so what's the best way to balance that and still incentivize firms and institutions to be where they can do the most good\nOur view was that financial incentives uh to lure companies or more importantly keep them was almost always a fool's errand we did a lot of work when we first came in the economy was just on its back\nAnd we're facing enormous budget deficits so the easy temptation would have been deprived companies to stay or bribe companies to calm ah we met with CEOs of companies all over the country and all over the world in addition to in New York we analyze their cost structures\nIn great detail\nAnd eventually what we concluded was companies are going to do what's in their economic interest over the long run and that providing these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nBut the crack was ultimately going to affect the dealer more than the user and so it just didn't make a lot of sense and so we just stopped instead\nThe way we'd compete was based on our natural strengths which we thought we could enhance and our number one natural strength was that nice\nSince they produce this incredible energy I'm that attracted companies to New York and we ought to build off of that most places have some sort of competitive advantage but they got to be honest about what it was and so that for us was really what the strategy became [noise]\nYeah you got to be true to yourself um that's one of the things that I consistently preached to leaders in cities around the country and around the world you know cities are like people um or maybe like companies they have personalities they have strengths and weaknesses\nYou know how hard it is to change your own personality it's hard to change of cities personality but that doesn't mean you can't you know structure around your strengths and structure around your weaknesses\nMole hole\nCity is unlike people reading companies\nCan be as we noted earlier\nDifficult to retrofit not just physically all those buildings that transportation and energy infrastructure but also psychic knee and culturally economically [noise] which is why doctors\nConcluded it would be really interesting to start the city from scratch [noise] two dozen Fifteen he teamed up with Google to create a company called sidewalk labs\nAnd our mission is to really help to redefine urban life or in the twenty first century combining cutting edge innovation with great urban planning\nBig thank you to everyone who supports northwest public broadcasting in a warm welcome to listeners who became members with their first time donations on super Thursday fewer dollars are hard at work I'm bringing stories of substance and inspiring music you meant to give it a little busy on Thursday you can still make a difference and pledge right\nNow at ... dot org and again thank you for all you do to make public radio possible\n[noise] this is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\n[noise]\nI'm sure you've been hearing the ever more anguish calls to regulate the huge tech firms known collectively as gaffe Google Amazon Facebook can at\nLeast confident super large platform or not but they have to develop a capacity to manipulate us to control us to control the information those delivered to us to control\nThe pricing which products are delivered to us to control us [noise] as producers [noise]\nCompanies are far bigger richer and arguably more dominant in tech companies in the past\nGoogle for instance has Ninety percent of global search engine market share Facebook has more than ... billion monthly active users Amazon has an estimated Ninety five million prime members in the U. S. that something like Seventy five percent of all American households\nIt's estimated almost fifty percent of all online spending goes to Amazon\nWho runs the Internet and use the Internet being ruined we're seeing the birth of new center of power real power we depend on these technologies that I had it in many ways wonderful\nAnd fascinating but you're making significant decisions you know laterally\nThere's also the question of whether the mission of these firms is as socially beneficial as many people believed they were in the early days Internet there's old is really smart\nEngineers there the brightest computer scientists and all they're thinking about is how do I keep someone on Facebook for ten more minutes less exact combination of things that will keep them stay on the site as long as possible so that we can show them as much advertising that's\nPossible [noise] so here's a question if you were one of those huge dominant super wealthy firms [noise] what would you do to ensure that the good times good [noise]\nProbably spend a lot of money lobbying politicians which yes they do there's been a huge ramping up lately in lobbying by tech firm [noise] but you might\nAlso do something a bit subtler story today begins with a journalist\nI'm Franklin for a writer with the Atlantic\nYou are one of three brothers who write books or talk about that for just a minute and the family that produced all of you\nRight so I have two brothers Johnathan he's written a good number of novels including everything is limited and I got a younger brother named Josh who is a a science writer who wrote a book called mood walking\nWith science Stein and it's actually incredibly uncomfortable for us to talk about growing up in a family of other writers just because uh\nI'm sure would in some ways we benefit from the novelty act of being three brotherly writers but then we all of course want to be known for her own accomplishments right but I you know\nOur parents didn't do anything they didn't force us to play violin or four hours a day and or or sit down and study the great chess masters [laughter] we watched a lot of heat man an Addams family reruns on television when we were growing up\nBut what are the things that they did was they gave us a credit card which they said we weren't allowed to spend essentially on anything except in the event of an incredible emergency and there was one exception to this which is that they said that we could basically spend the credit card that will let the book shop and\nMainstream online publications would just start by Microsoft and so there was a huge enthusiasm certainly among the chattering classes\nThere was a certain amount of utopian isn't associated with the emergence of the Internet this idea that we weren't going to tie the world together I Love search engines I Love the fact that I can access every\nBook in human history in a nanosecond I Love that I can get things delivered to my door incredibly quickly and these things arguably make life much better\nAnd maybe in arguably make life\nMuch better so these technologies were incredible and Amazon is an incredible company the Kindle is an incredible invention the pad and yeah and I found were incredible innovation and so I think we were right to marvel at them\nSo after writing for sleep for a while you moved on to the New Republic or as you call it the intellectual Oregon for hard nosed liberalism ultimately became editor they're not once but twice\nSo the New Republic but this little magazine that always had outsized influence in politics and culture it was an incredibly elitist\nOregon and managed to protest over a hundred years well never really turning a profit and so as we entered the Internet age that became a more and more difficult thing to continue to do and so we ended up shifting from one ownership group to the next and\nI got so exhausted trying to find an owner and kind of sick of that I ended up resigning his editor but then a couple of years after I resigned the magazine got bought by a guy called Chris Hughes who's been mark soccer birds roommate at Harvard\nAnd co founder of Facebook and he bought the magazine and to me it just seems like almost too good to be true or that you had this guy\nWho understood social media who had incredible number of resources and seemed devoted to this little magazine that I was also devoted to and so I came back\nAnd I edited the magazine and Christian I Try to remake it\nAnd their relationship in the beginning seemed like it was unbelievably good\nYeah we became really good friends and it was ... rating we felt like we were trying to save something that was imperiled in the world and that maybe we can help provide some sort of dignified solution to the rest of journalism which was grappling with a lot of the same issues that we were grappling with\nBut there was a moment when things just took this turn which was ...\nThat he didn't want to lose at least not lose a whole lot of money with it and so we had to turn around our financial position incredibly quickly\nAnd so he insisted that we start chasing clicks and two thousand Thirteen ... way to get clicks was to post to clip from last night's Daily Show with John Stewart and he's ... the\nHeadline on it and you may be right back a couple of sentences about it and everybody would click on it\nAnd you got caught up in at least monitoring the numbers right\nYes I did um look data is crack cocaine and if you're the guy who had a hard time getting a date in high school just suddenly find yourself producing things that are extremely popular\nYou become obsessed with replicating that popularity in ... in some ways everybody in the magazine wanted to be successful on Facebook we wanted to master social media and this new environment but we didn't want that new environment to dictate how we did our jobs\nAll right so we should say that you ended up getting will you ended up quitting as you're about to be fired from the New Republic\n[laughter] yeah so um you know I I took the brave decision to resign when I learned that there was some guy who already had my job and was offering other people jobs at the gym republic\nIt's funny you're describing what was happening to you at the New Republic but it sounds as though you're also perhaps describing\nYour view of what happened at places like Google and Facebook over time where you may begin with a certain set of motivations but as those motivations lead you to this overwhelming commercial success you're so seduced by the magnitude of that success that you can't help but want to replicate it over and over again\nYou had to completely right I felt like it in retrospect I realized that I was just living this compressed version of recent history\nThe reason the history of the Internet [noise] over the years Franklin for his view of the Internet should the same guy who used to think this\nThere was a certain amount of utopian as an associated with the emergence of the Internet and this I Love search engines and this these technologies were incredible Amazon is an incredible company has now come\nTo think this Amazon thinks of itself as the everything store and it's gotten itself in pretty much every conceivable business it owns whole foods it powers the cloud it yeah\nThat it doesn't try to squeeze into its empire he also thinks this as Facebook shapes the way that we consume news as Google shapes the way that we interact with information and it's Amazon has shaped the way that we interact with books [noise]\nThe dominant set these companies exert ends up trickling through the cultural intellectual ecosystem and with Amazon my concern is that the book business has become utterly dependent on them that they hold one of the future of monopoly is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Freakonomics Radio", "city": "Pullman", "day": "14"}
