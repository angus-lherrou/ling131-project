{"month": "10", "state": "WA", "station": "KWSU", "content": "And on K. R. if a Ninety One point seven eight feet to ditch the radio [noise]\nLast week we were talking to the journalist Franklin for about his latest book world without mind the existential threat to the Big Ten and\nMy argument is again the big technology companies which really are raping to expand into every ... of our lives\nWe spoke with for a year ago this book was partially funded by a center left think tank called the New America foundation\nSince become relevant just because they fired for his critic of Google from the foundation which is noteworthy because the nation has received a fair amount of money from Google chairman Eric Schmidt\nRight so how much fun as it for you to be publishing a new book and already distancing yourself from the foundation underwriting of it\nAnd it actually does it feel good because you America has been supportive of me over time and I'd rather not be like a jerk and just about the when they've been so nice to me but\nThis does feel like sadly reflective of a much bigger issue who was the critic who was fired his name is Barry land any ransom make all the open markets program there I'm very active opponent of monopoly and a\nVery vociferous critic of ah of Google or used to have an affiliation\nDo we tell the rest that messy story\nAt no point did Google or any ... tell me to fire Mary Landrieu\nAnd we look at how corporations use philanthropy to shape the public debate and how that can go terribly wrong\n[noise]\nGuess freakonomics radio show that explores the inside of every ... here's your house even now [noise]\n[noise]\nBarry Lynn started out as a journalist\nI worked in Venezuela and in Peru as a foreign correspondent and then after that I rented magazine called global business magazine we should say he was a pro business magazine [noise] we were a magazine that Hamdan to people who ran business and\nSo we had a real inside look at how low was Asian actually works at the institutional level that\nInside look led to Lynn and crossing over to the other side he came to believe the corporations are too powerful and that their power to concentrated this was a theme he pursued in a couple of books and two thousand two with the New America foundation his project came to be known as the open markets Institute\nWe got the work going and we did it with\nIncreasing effect over the last seven years to the point where in twenty six pain we had a number of folks on the hill starting to understand that indeed America has a monopoly problem and the first person who sort of really reached out and said\nI Want to actually sort of help shine a light on this problem was a Senator Warren and the result was a speech that she is on Capitol Hill\nSenator Elizabeth Warren speech was part of a conference organized by the open markets Institute it was called America's monopoly problem today\nIn America competition is dying\nThis was probably the most important speech about concentration in the United states about the monopoly problems and a series of speeches that FDR gave the Nineteen thirties\nGoogle apple and Amazon provide platforms that lots of company\nMany cases compete with as small company that platform tend to come a tool to snuff out competition\nAnd she said you know this is not just an issue that affects us as consumers it also affects our democracy because it's this concentration of power\nThat leaves two concentrations of wealth and concentrations of wealth lead to concentrations of control over government and other institutions of authority\nThis line of criticism would seem to be pretty much in sync with the mission of not only the open market and do but also its parent organization the New America foundation\nIn my own scholarship I've written about monopolies unrest of consolidation and data ownership\nThat Anne Marie slaughter the former State Department official in Princeton professor who's now president and CEO of New America\nWhat convince me to leave Princeton and and the head of New America which was a big move because I had a wonderful position at at Princeton\nOr was this idea that we really could be a place that hosted fundamental debate about our future and the digital age\nBut as Barry Lynn tells the story New America didn't share his enthusiasm for the conference he put together where Senator Warren spoke\nWell a few people in my organization New America we are not happy with the way we're framing the conference than the fact that we were focusing some of our attention on the platform monopolies and especially on Google\nWhat was wrong with focusing on Google in a conference about monopoly after all they do own some Ninety percent of the global search market\nOr I guess the question is why is\nIt was our work a new American problematic for Google Google ... of Eric Schmidt who is the now the chair of the board at Google was also for a long time on the New America board and then for a period of time served as chair of our board\nEric Schmidt was the chairman of Google and its renamed parent company alphabet for several years he stepped down in early two thousand Eighteen after our interview with Barry Lynn\nFor years Smith was also a CEO of Google he's also given New America a lot of money both personally and through his family foundation so did Google itself between Schmidt and Google New America had received roughly twenty million dollars since its founding in Nineteen Ninety\nShips that goes back to the early days at New America and actually had never seemed to result in any kind of problems at New America up to this point\nBut now it seems there was a problem we're Schmidt and or Google leaning on New America as Lynn's critique of the company grew more intense a year after the New America conference where Senator Warren spoke against Google's domination\nEuropean antitrust regulators hit Google with a huge fine to point seven billion dollars for allegedly tilting search results in its own favor not long after that in June of two thousand Seventeen\nBarry Lynn posted a statement on the New America website it congratulated European regulators forgiving Google such a good spanking\nAnd urged American regulators do the same\nYeah we release this statement in support of the decision in Europe and that was on June twenty seventh and on June twenty nine I was told that my entire team had to leave and we had two months to leave\nOne natural conclusion to draw was at Google had stepped in and asked New America to do something about Barry Lynn indeed that's how it was portrayed in New York Times they're headline read Google critic ousted from think tank funded by the tech giant\nAnd at that point I you know ask for this decision will be reconsidered known and if it could not be reconsidered I ask for more time I was told that neither of those was possible\nThe writer Franklin for who happens to sit on the board of Barry Lynn's open markets Institute told us simpler version of events he made it clear that leans statement about the European regulators decision\nThis was something that was a bit too far for Google and numerical with very generous than supporting me and they never did anything to interfere with my own work but I was fairly\nOutraged by the treatment of very and I can't resign from New America because I'm not affiliated with I'm not taking any money from them now but I'm extremely disappointed\nBut Anne Marie slaughter offered a substantially different portrayal first of all she says no\nFunder at New America has ever influenced
