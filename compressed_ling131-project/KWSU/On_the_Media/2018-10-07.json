welcome to live wire my name is look Burbank I'm your host\nHope you're having a great week doing whatever you're doing we have a great show in store for you are theme this hour is on the contrary we got a bunch of gas who are doing things\nContrary to what sort of perceived wisdom and but here's the thing it's totally working for the [noise] uh these are not those kinds of people who are just ... for the sake of being a contrarian because as you know those kind of people are super annoying [noise]\nAnd also it turns out\nI'm One of those kinds of people at least when it comes to my marriage let's pick things up on stage at the Alberta rose theater in Portland\n[noise] I'm\nKind of person who when my wife does something or says something that is what I Would do or say I cannot stifle the urge to contradict her [noise] and when you were married to someone there are just so many of those opportunities [noise]\nThat just arise\nWhat makes is even worse is that we're not talking about anything major she's not like on the Internet late at night telling me that Trump might actually have a point about Obama's birth certificate like she's not saying things that are like a objectively crazy\nWhere the disagreements or about things like\nHow bright should the lights be in the room when you're watching TV at night [noise]\nThis is a long running\nLittle bit them if it's a nighttime it's kind of makes it feel like a movie theater it's kinda fun my wife says full brightness she thinks it is depressing when the lights are low last night we were settling in for a romantic evening about to watch them dateline NBC\n[noise]\nAnd I go over and I am the lights and she gets up and walked right over and turns them back to full blast\nAnd I said why did you do that and this was her answer verbatim she said because we're not donors [noise]\n\nI've been thinking about that comment for twenty four hours straight and I still don't really understand it [laughter] I don't even feel like those are related concepts [noise]\nBut like it's not a big deal the light in the room I should just let it go it doesn't matter but instead what I Do is every time I get up to go get something and I come back in the room [noise] I just subtly ... five point\nZero zero zero five percent [noise] casually as I'm coming in the room [noise]\nAnd over the course of like ten trips I've brought it down to the level I Want it to be at and she hasn't even noticed it just like some kind of reverse gas lighting and it's [noise]\nWe disagree about when food should be thrown out my theory is you can scrape mold off of most things and if that doesn't work you just toast living Tweedle out of it and that\nMath but a lot of issues [noise]\nShe is strongly of the opinion that everything should be thrown out by at the latest the sell by date\nThe date that the grocery store establishes that when they have to sell it to you by she doesn't just want to throw it out on the cell day she goes making

I. repeal burger rose theater in Portland this week our theme\nIs on the contrary and we are talking\nAs well as their new book brunch is how I'm this book is sort of a criticism of brunch but really it's a celebration of dinner parties thank you um what are the what are the are the keys to throwing a good dinner party you whether you want it to or not you've kind of become the national experts on this topic because of your radio show in ...\nWell we wrote the book on it now literally wrote the book on it\nBut I mean the first world dinner parties is right there on the titles to have dinner and the party yeah that's it now that seems deceptively simple the point is there should be no agenda at a dinner party you can have a boss at a dinner party it can't be setting up people at a dinner party a holiday party isn't a dinner party because there's an agenda there a dinner party is really we considered recess for adults\nThis is the place which is made up of less than twenty five percent of your family because with [laughter]\nWith more than that there's an agenda taking place uh we we say such as more than that and my mom's in the corner yelling that Tim Allen about valley press right we save save that for ... for Thanksgiving and I go to separate thing\nUm and so that's the rule number one is to have people in your home and asked them for nothing and just feed them um most of our lives we have to be a where employees are employers were in control where soccer and coaches were doing all this stuff but this is the one place where you can let that go\nSo those are the like the the basics what now what elevated dinner party from just meeting the minimum definition of a dinner party to being actually a good dinner party\nOh well I mean a lot of things come conversation would be a great thing to have what you're trying to do is get stories about people and we and it's fascinating we actually have a quote from Alan Alda about people who actually wrote a book about sort of the way people share information and industry when people tell stories\nTheir minds literally sync up like their their brains to light up\nIn certain ways or that it's almost like a mind meld and with people so if you can get people to tell interesting stories you're actually sort of creating community and getting everybody literally on the same wavelength so why do you think\nThat the dinner party has declined in in ... maybe not popularity in people's minds but certainly in frequencies yeah I think the rise\nOf foodie at them as many people more interested in cooking but also made people uncomfortable to cook and invite people into their homes\nOr we suggest that only fifty one percent of the food needs to be made at home you need over just fifty one percent just over the finish line there to make it a reflection of you and needs to be your food\nUh that's one thing the vents you've I think people are I mean we're in Portland we wrote this from New York in LA our ... our apartments are small and I think people are afraid to bring people into their homes they feel like it needs to be perfect I think that's\nA present things id and I think that people have\nA couple of quick questions here um music at a dinner party or\nAm one of those people who will spend a day putting together like a six hour play list that I Want to just like crescendo with the Scissor Sisters cover of comfortably numb right as everyone's getting a little buzz yeah and then someone else wants to plug in their iPod and because they have jock jams on there or something\nIs are you a bad host if you kind of rule your stereo within with an iron fist at your own dinner party absolutely\nNot only that it's a musical dictatorship\nI absolutely see either you're in control you have any control over to one other person\nOtherwise it's an absolute free for all you know one moment you're listening to fly in the family stone another moment you're listening to ... which could be fun for the after party but not for the meal itself so you need to take control and I think you were wise to create a playlist beforehand and you can just set it and forget it what about children\nAt a dinner party yours or your friends wanting to bring them\nThere was an actual grown [laughter]\nYou know it was and how dare they [noise] uh\nWe we did we have said as we said before dinner parties a recess for adults who are not adults children but\nBut it is very important first of all we want kids and it is important too to in in coal train them to the pleasures of the form of a dinner party\nI'm Glad to hear you say that Rico because even though on on one level it feels like it's for the adults maybe it's a little bit less fun if there's kids there I remember being a kid at\nLike dinner parties are for me it was like a lot of weird church potluck in prayer meetings but where you're a kid and you get to be around adults and observe them in their environment if you're a certain kind of get at least kind of get out what that was like everything to me\nAbsolutely but but and so the the catches here that they should be old enough that they can take care of themselves so that they can observe from afar the adults can have our time and the kids can have for the kids need to be just old enough that they can entertain themselves without setting themselves on fire or ... and\nAnd like going to the bathroom and they have to be able to hold their liquor [laughter] at\nIts heart is probably\nObviously the book is brunch is how Brendan Francis knew them Enrico galley on everybody\n[noise]\n\nRico and Brendan your new book brunch as hell points out of what you guys see as the sort of drawbacks of the brunch\nOf branching it on the rag thought here's what we've done we have done some research on popular restaurant brunch is and how many calories those breakfast and brunch is contained we're going to give you a caloric number because you're the brunch expert traitors you have to guess\nIf that is over or under the actual calories in these breakfasts liberate calling it caloric over under\nCow town\nWe view the did you get the amount game\nIt's like schoolhouse rock schoolhouse became gender Biden turned into a restaurant okay so this is a\nPretty simple game I'm going to give you a caloric amount and you just have to try to decide and you got to come to consensus on this um as the as the the authors of branches hell if you think it's over or under the Denny's grand slam okay one thousand calories over or under it's more\nFor I have no idea calories ... like I don't really think about ... I'm\nSorry I just feel alone even another friend\nI went\nBack to write [noise] I'll say\nIs higher than than a grand slam no I'm saying it's way too low for grad school so Rico your opinion is a grand slam as more than a thousand calories ran in your opinion is that it has less than a thousand calories are okay I Will say that Rico is a hundred percent\nRight and Brenda hundred percent Ron yeah it is one thousand one hundred and eight calories fifty three point five grams of fat\nHow about the jumbo Rudy to depression pretty firm I hop over or under Thirteen hundred calories\nRudy sounds healthy yes it does how sausage bacon enhanced compost and pancake so the compost the vegetable yeah I've never yeah that sounds how the protein I'm going to say it's under\nUnder Thirteen hundred calories that is Brent inferences beneficial answer ... or the ingredients you just had real\nHas come in and they meet ...\nNo no no I Would say that they've fruit component\nBut with bacon and and then I didn't really get some breakfast meats and they're making their sausage there's also ham I still I then I say that is again too low it's got to be\nThirteen hundred calories it is over it has fourteen hundred calorie and my God if you are looking for the diet choice the regular Rudy Tutti comes in Eddie ... eight hundred and forty calories [laughter] how about the garbage plate a regional delicacy in Rochester New York one of the many places you\nCan buy their new wrenches hell yeah here's what's in the garbage plate home fries baked beans French fries macaroni salad it's healthy malice mustard onion and hot sauce me last wow two slices of Italian bread with butter on it I Believe you're reading my journal\nIs over or under seven hundred thousand calories\nOff one [laughter] it's tough\nHad the means and I'm going to say under I'm going to say I'm going to say under because the word salad that you're\nCatching on to this game is in fact under it is a mere one thousand six hundred and sixty four calories a breakfast of champions in sixty four rituals like other Arabic time to end the bank\nBut where I was in my life was in a place where all I felt was a sad\nQuiet stone up my throat and I couldn't accept any of the offers and it was right there in front of me and and the thing I Know now almost twenty twenty five years later is that for some of us saying yes or accepting what's in front of you isn't easy\nBecause we don't believe we deserve it\nAnd it could take us years like for me it took ten to Twenty years for me to stand up inside the thing that was being handed me the front of me and to say you know I might I might be able to stand up inside this too\nAnd so I'm kinda here to remind any of the rest of you that\nWe all deserve a place at the table and it doesn't matter what shape it takes and we're not all going to look like celebrity culture and that's a its own kind of beauty the weird kind of offended stars still shine in the sky so I'm here for you [noise]\n\nIf you start or religion I Am signing on [laughter]\nI Want to be the first adherence to the church of Lydia ... thank you so much for being on live wire
