he likes to juggle weird things\nSo just you know I'll be like in the grocery store and I'll have like an avocado and de onion and a a bottle of water\nThat's high stakes dropping off Cato you're buying that thing yeah\nBudget Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time he was Nineteen\nAnd it was a bit of a gym rat at his peak he could bench press around two hundred and forty pounds one day Tommy was hanging out with a friend when he says hey you want the rest of this pretty workout pre workout that's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym and it just gives you crazy energy and you can lift Moran longer and harder um\nYou know at least those are the claims just to be clear this is not a steroid in case that's what you're thinking Tommy is very against using those\nAnyway Thomas friend is really not happy with the stuff that he purchased a is after Tommy I\nPaid sixty bucks for it and it gives me such bad stomach issues that I it's ruining my work out to you know counterproductive\nIf you're not familiar with the supplement world it's not the most tightly regulated world and on top of that back in two thousand and six more and more folks were starting to buy things online like supplement\nThe gears in my head started turning and I started looking up several interviews and I I couldn't find anything that was legit I mean it was all just written by the manufacturer they could just\nComment on paternity he could build an online review side but bodybuilder skipped honest feedback about the supplements they're putting into that bodies\nAnd so time he got to work he taught himself some computer coding and he created what he would eventually call supplement reviews dot com before long super chiseled due to a logging on to leave their super honest reviews and look I Know not all body builders down this way but\nThese views of adults five days pretty suspicious [laughter] especially when you look at the reviews notes five eight compared to the average ... their way more positive\nTime he says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well there was a one issue with words that were being used over and over again in the reviews of it so the phrase repetition basically what we do is we we built a gigantic list of all of the\nPhrases that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\nGo after them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example it was it's law and this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated for example\nThe court is very tough and doesn't bend like the chords do but that's probably a good thing that's not you know that you shouldn't do that and more than one review but for here we see it in three reviews [noise] um yeah\nAnd and in seven reviews someone wrote it's easy to get it back onto the court and to use again ah I don't know what it means for seven people feel that way [laughter] well seven people also say\nThey performed at their duty with honor and respect and there is the correct [laughter] yeah so\nTommy software vent about a dozen different paths than I fall on cable reviews and his reports it out and it just aggravating\nSo it went from a four star out of five with a hundred and Seventy seven reviews on Amazon and the

product that winds up cluttered with suspicious reviews\nAnything with like low manufacturing costs and high margins I'm so like what yeah yeah I found cables backup batteries screen protectors phone cases weight loss pills to stop\nWe of course reached out to Amazon and about this and they declined to go on tape but they are familiar with Tommy website they sent us an extensive statement about it ... itself admit that they do not have the city that you could do this one is like a you know non weightlifter\nOh okay and where do you make it self admitted that they do not have the data to know or even stay with high confidence whether a review with fake according\nTo what Amazon is saying it's not necessarily different from what Tommy told us about his own website he totally admit that his site is looking for patterns of unusual behavior and there's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as a natural\nFor Amazon that as a problem we have hundreds of millions of reviews on Amazon and of that total less than one percent are inauthentic Amazon also told us that it's investing in its own system to catch fake\nReviewers in other words the Amazon saying there's not a problem but we're working on it and this makes me like I Wonder a little bit how much should I trust the big sites like Amazon are actually going to go out of their way to fix\nThis such complicate it right because these e commerce sites they make money when they sound more products\nRight like it doesn't matter if it's a positive Ficre view if someone buys a product that's good for the site\nBut that that might come a time where there was just too many fake we'd be sure like\nThere's a tipping point where [noise] enough trust is lost\nThat we all just give up on the Internet shopping and we'll go

[noise]\nBut it's still a small business in fact Romney himself\nWorks at the sales counter during the day [noise]\nLike doing that actually helps and figure out almost by accident hit next opportunity\nIn Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five\nI Would be in a restaurant and working [noise] and I'd have a customer walk up to me guy could I have a bad guy I said sure and they say ISIS I'd handed them the low and they pull out of back from the local supermarket from a local stop and shop\nAnd they put roasted turkey and maybe [noise] she's on it and you know you didn't have to be a Harvard MBA to say wow the real thing here\nIs wrapped up back yet is not the end it's the platform to sell sandwiches and so in Nineteen eighty five\nWe created the first French bakery cafe in the Copley Place malls in Boston she decided that you were going to make this a new experience and New Zealand than experience where people could come and\nEat lunch and buy bread yeah we're going to go from being simply a bakery to a bakery cafe right\nIn almost instantly is broken down company became very hot people wanted this I can remember the second day um that we opened in Copley Place where you had fifty people in line while before we open the doors\nAnd where are you serving there [noise] um we were serving sandwiches\nAnd some soups made on our Britain course on but they were differentiated kinds of sandwiches they were roast beef in in ... on on a real French back at it would be a [noise]\nRoasted turkey brie cheese um and I think what Obama was providing and I don't think we had language for back then but what the big recap I was\nWas an alternative between down and dirty fast food yeah it's fine dining yeah and for people who were working in white collar jobs increasingly in urban setting\nTo do something that was better\nIn a quick service mode she'll she'll once she will serve stones idea\nOf creating cafes and ... it was after the races you just I mean at that point it was clear that you were going to begin a pretty rapid expansion\nWell guy we you know as soon as we came up with this idea of a decree cafe we saw all kinds of interested in how we became hot you know every major office building one of the French big cricket and we found we developed big competitors [noise]\nAlright says something something happens early in this period as shortly after you go public which is among panic choirs is a small chain of St Louis based\nSandwich shops called the St Louis bread company what what's the story there why did you buy a dislike small chain in St Louis whether it was the idea to to turn them into about ...\n[noise] no I you know I I talk to everybody in our industry and there's nobody I don't learn from and I was asked by an investment bank to meet several gentleman who owned a company called ... brand company and it hit me these were Nineteen stores in St Louis\nDoing ... almost as much as we did within the bullpen\nBut doing so in suburban St Louis and it struck me this was an opportunity to acquire St Louis bread company and maybe we could build that into three hundred four hundred five hundred stores in the suburban marketplace while oh bumped cameras are urban stress\nSo in November of Nineteen Ninety three\nWe bought the St Louis Freeh company\nWas Nineteen stores for twenty three million dollars\nYou choir St Louis bread company and you will not going to give it the name of it was going to be St Louis red company or did you initially did you immediately realize you're going to rename this thing [noise]\nBut we rename than cuts at\nAn airport in all markets other than St Louis but we renamed it ... bread because as we went to new markets people often thought from St Louis was more associated with Clydesdale horses now than it was with Brad right and so we wanted an empty vessel personality we could form\nSo out of curiosity in that by Ninety eight you're you're watching St Louis ... an Arab really start to grow do you remember how many stores you had at that point where you could you expand beyond the original Nineteen\nYeah by Nineteen Ninety eight we roughly had a hundred and fifty stores\nAnd frankly I was kinda bummed\nI was looking at an Arab read as one of four divisions in this multi divisional restaurant cut it open than I Do bumping along penned international I had an hour and I had to bump pen manufacturing [laughter] and I was with a friend that you know\nFor every hundred people talk about having a nationally Dominic ...\nTo do so is so difficult but this one has that potential and my friends looked at me and said Ron what would you do get a narrow owned Obama pen\nNot oh bumpy ... and I said you know I take away all the resources we had put it against an Arab becoming a nationally dominant brand\nAnd I take myself and the very best people we had and I go down there and make it happen\nYou were proposing to sell all bon pan and I was proposing to sell everything other than prepare you were saying all ... and all the human resources and myself and go down and make this happen\nSo basically we're saying these ... for some businesses get rid of these three take the\nCash and pour it into Americans that the place that's the thing that has the potential yes so you go to your board and you say let's do this and you're bored is looking at you like you're not speaking they actually got into this business because of all don't pan\n[noise] literally that's what happened guy it was a huge board room struggle because I have two votes are venture capitalist had three and all of them had invested in old bump pat let's just say there were very heated discussions yeah and if I hadn't pulled this off I probably wouldn't have stayed the c._e._o. there\nI mean you had a I guess when you sold among had it was like two hundred and fifty store or something like that about two hundred fifty stores and the ... only had a hundred and eighty see you
