certainly have up for reasons that I Am about to explain from the stage of the Alberta rose theater in Portland or take a listen to that [noise]\nIf I seem\nA little\nCalmer a little more at peace a little more centered than normal\nStanding up here it's not an accident people\nI recently started meditating [noise] and it is changing my life [noise] technically I have\nOfficially started the meditation\n[noise] but I downloaded a meditation apt to my phone [noise]\nWhich as you know is the hardest part about meditating I Believe the Dalai Lama\nSaid that [noise] I'd like to tell you that\nThis is the first meditation apple pie of downloaded to my phone I'd like to tell you that but it is not true [noise]\nHave a folder on my phone [noise] that is just basically like the enlightenment graveyard [noise]\nIt is full of meditation apps and breathing apps\nAnd various things like that that I have downloaded and never even opened\nI like to hear about it or I I read about it on slate and I'm like this is ...\nIt changed my life even though I have been on this journey pretty much my entire life to try to find\nThis thing whatever it is that's going to actually make me feel some sense of inner peace and happiness like even when I was a kid when I was ten years old this was my little ritual I Would do my chores on a Saturday or get my allowance which was two bucks\n[noise] I Would ride my bike to the Jack in the box near our house and I would get a jumbo jak for Ninety nine cents and I would get some fries with the rest of the money I'm sidebar that was about Thirty years ago\nAnd three decades later the going price for a jumbo jak hovers around Ninety nine cent still [noise]\nWhich seems like a big red flag\nSo I get my little food and I'd ride my bike home and I would sit on my bed which was all made in my little room that was all clean from doing my chores and I would get the food set up and take out\nThe first French fry and I didn't catch up and do bite into it and then the moment that I was biting into that French fry I Would feel a total sense of calm [noise]\n\nThat would last for upwards of Fifteen seconds [noise]\nIt was time to start thinking about the next thing whatever that was an even know intellectually even then I understood that this idea of having to have everything perfect even though I knew that was not like the recipe for happiness I sort of have continued to live my life thinking that if I can just to get\nEverything perfect\nThen I can start being the person that I actually am like this what you're seeing in fact forty one years of this is not even me\nThe real me has not even had a chance yet [noise]\nHave been a guy my whole life who's just improvising and doing his best with the imperfections surrounded by this is what a guy does when he has a credit score that is only barely north of six hundred and a yellow lab dog that sheds everywhere [noise] but when I get everything worked out\nHost we are here with George Saunders his latest book is Lincoln in the bar do this book is about Abraham Lincoln's son willy who passes away and he's in the ... which is a sort of limbo I guess of sorts\nAnd a ... you said you had the idea for many years ago but then you started working on in earnest for about four years or so when did you realize you really had something\nYou know there's in the book one of the things I did was I I uh quoted from historical sources verbatim goes right plagiarize and all of that was an amazing part of the book yeah\nAnd so there was just an afternoon where I I had typed up all these historical sources cut them up with scissors was on the floor arranging it kind of feeling like I'm just avoiding writing to sufficient an elaborate we're doing a collage that's right yeah\nAnd then at one point it describes his party that the Lincolns had and it was kind of his party that sent the sun and to the death spiral 'cause it's very loud party in the White House [noise] so um I was arranging these bits and suddenly\nIt just it just felt wow that party has happened in front of my eyes so it was kind of the realization that even that weird thing that had nothing to do with me typing new tax was part of my uh attempt to emotionally moved to the the audience and then I thought oh this is really weird and actually there's a great feeling like you're being a little naughty\nLike someone's gonna really hate the you know and and that's actually the feeling you want\nBecause if you can convert that person who says that's just punch this fake news\nYou know or whatever is that if you can well below like we're trying to create a safe space for these people [noise] say like a\nForty five minute timeout on those terms\nIf you can convert the skeptic then then you're really an intimate communication with your readers\nUm you obviously had to do a ton of research about about Lincoln as well and about the time and did you find out stuff about Abraham Lincoln that you had not previously known\nYeah I just fell in love with them I mean he's a one thing was that he was actually even though he was known as being ugly incredibly attractive to women women all we know really really drawn to him very kind very tall kind of powerful guy and he he loves his wife so much so one of the ways he self gamed\nWas to deflect his attention from young women he had a whole system of kind of\nYou know turning away from them in the name of not aggravating married not making your own happy so I thought that was kind of cool where do you find out something like that has made it up\nYou know yeah I see [noise] I Know that that is are you are a master of George Saunders\nBut also you know the thing is I I I came to love about him and said here's a guy who's you know\nHe hasn't noise in the last four years of his life making incredible progress ... learning new stuff everyday killing tens of thousands of young men with his mistakes you know and if you track those last three years he's somebody who just kept opening up an opening up and I think his I mean this is my interpretation but I think his ego just really shrunk\nAnd he became so involved in trying to bring benefit for everybody else that I mean Buddhism I ... and if somebody who's a\nInitially very large ego\nIn the in the face of this pain kind of shrunk and a sort of watch them at the end having realizations about race that we're still not quite you know we still haven't really internalize was kind of really moving you know\nWould you say that stands in contrast to the current president\n\nWhen you when you're going to work at ... under a softball question that's going to pop up\nI actually [noise] I I Do want to talk a little bit about that world with you because you wrote a piece back in June of twenty sixteen or at least that was it was published in the New York\nMaybe one of them are eliminating things about the the sort of rise of Donald Trump you went on the campaign trail and just talk to people at his various rallies um did did that\nThen to make you less surprised then the rest of us when he actually won or were you a shock to know I we weren't\nReally shocked I went before he was nominated and it'll alarming because mainly because of the extent to which I couldn't communicate with his supporters nice people we had a good time it's like a like a Jimmy Buffett concert helped music you know it's just more than\n[noise]\nBut when you got right down to it we we liked each other but we didn't persuade each other so I've I've come to think that when you look at Lincoln ... you you really learn what we all know which is to be a human being as you get older the goal is to get more loving\nLess sure of yourself more comfortable than be Judy more generous you know Lincoln did the current administration seems locked in this kind of incompetent mode of fearful mess and distrust and that's really weird it's really not what we're about as a country except\nSome thirty eight percent think it is so alarming you know and as an artist I think if you step towards everything with sympathy as your first move you actually get more information\nYou know and then when you get more information you're actually a better adversary if you have to be one and so I I think it's actually a time when people who are open minded in large hard it can do both things resist furiously and a local uncontrollably and that's actually where we're going to get out of this man [noise]\n\nOh well now it's time for me to turn the audience against you\nWere talking to George Saunders now you you got your graduate degree in and literature when you were I think around thirty but before that you actually graduated from the Colorado School of mines and worked in oil exploration I did yeah guy [noise]\nDid you when it's mindless Muslims\nHave got to get a bigger signs that is so confusing and the fact that the two schools are next to each other very when when did\nYou sort of realized that you are not the you know oil exploration was not for you and were you in your heart a sort of writer at that time to just doing something you thought was maybe a a job that you could make a living\nAnd I I kind of realize that the first week of classes because I'd been a really bad student in Chicago wasn't going to go to college and I had these two teachers Linda Holmes who intervened and actually called the school and got me in\nFlunk out because I flunked out of there I was going to go back to the starting line in Chicago in you know ... circle bubble so even though I could feel I wasn't good at it as I ... this is a real turning point you got to stick it out\nSo I did and then I went to Asia I worked in oil fields and actually it was okay and I was writing a little and then I had a thing where I I was trying to do a Hemingway thing so I went swimming in Sumatra\nRiver after some drinking and with and with no clothes if I you know that thing that'll sure are ah\nBut then I was swimming in it there's a an oil pipeline along the river and on the river that are like four hundred monkeys and I'm dog paddling there and I see them all probing into the water you know [noise] I'm like how I Wonder if that's okay [noise] wasn't and I got deathly ill for about three years uh\nGave up the job and came home and started writing [laughter]\nWow that is expected that story to be going [noise] but it was what I\nTell my students you know swimming approve the river and you'll know [laughter]\nWell yeah you you teach\nYou teach a and the M. F. a program in Syracuse um and and I wanted to get your take on on the state of things there are and one is there a particular piece of writing advice that you find yourself giving to your students like more than any other piece of advice\nYeah so what I Try to tell them is that there's actually this whole beautiful thing called revision like radical revision that if you're trying to find your voice is your best friend you you aren't necessarily your totality when you just talk you know if we both stand up for and just talk\nIt there's some indication if we are but when you go back and start trimming that talking cutting it down to its essence that's another way that you can you can weigh in so to me there there is a great line um I think Robert Frost said this at a public talk some student ask them a complicated question about this on it and he said\nYoung man don't worry work [noise] that's very good now I tell that story and then with a process expert pulled me aside of the readings and he didn't say that he said he said he said don't work worry\n[noise] I like it better that way you have it so yeah yeah do you feel encouraged about the you know next generation of writers\nI mean are they doing things just differently than than than your generation can conceive of because of the way that they've communicated with each other because of age you you feel a\nLittle bit of that but what what the best thing about my job is every fall can we meet a new group of young people and it just makes you realize that that ... talent is\nTo tighten over time you know there [noise] is\nThat a result of the monkey river\nYou because of that but\nWhen you but when you see these young people are like you know if I think if I ever find myself saying these kids today it's just my mind being stupid you know so I Am so cheered by by senior been traveling around the country to the generation the young generation now is unbelievably uh compared to what I was\nOn obstructed in loving yep I'm very hopeful about the future well I think they're in good hands\nWith George Saunders teaching them George thank you so much [noise]\n\nAll right George here on on live wire were all about getting real and then getting truthful so in front of you\nI placed a jar on this broadcast desk or a jar of truth it's got five questions in it the five a central questions of our age and your job is to pick one out at random and an answer it truthfully we call this the jar truth [noise]\nUm you you also have a you've written for television I Know that you have projects their development and you act as well mhm or\nIs there one of these things that you like you feel like you have a sort of special aptitude for are you a standup comic who actually are you an actor who got into comedy\nI'm a human being whose so lost in this world I Will do anything to the appreciation of other people [noise]\nSo what it ultimately comes down to [noise] I Know\nEvery single day I'm like so I just stopped doing stand up I I it's the most shallow for you know it's like a very sometimes is good and then like acting is something that's fun but I don't really think I'm not good honestly I don't think anyone is that good I think ten percent of people who act or good everyone else who can everyone can do that [noise]\nThat's just the fact that Daniel Day Lewis and then there's like All right everybody else you know what I mean [noise] I mean let's be honest\nI'm so acting\nAs whatever um I really enjoy writing but it's a lot of work you know one really wants to work that hard ultimately if I could do anything I Would open up a little general store\nAnd like to have a bell on the door and I'd sort of coffee in the morning and I'd pick up my kids from school and then like make dinner and they go back to the store and then you know you know when you get your you know that's an achievable dream\nYou know it's not I've been trying to buy this one place in my neighborhood and the guys like I Want to have a hundred grand I'm like what are you out of your mind to seven hundred grand\nSo you actually walk into a store like can I buy this story from you well\nFirst I met his wife and I realize they weren't doing so well you know what I mean [noise]\nShe was loose lipped about it she shouldn't have been then I got a husband [noise] I got him on the\nPhone wrote up a proposal that he's like why don't you come and have a meeting with me comes in he tells me they're skimming off the top they're not even reporting the talks so I Can't get a I went for a small business loan I Can't get a small business loan when he's telling me they're making two hundred and twenty grand a year but your reporting forty helping me wait so like they are located at choose to\n[noise] but guess what everyone cheating\nHave you sent the text messaging the last two weeks then you probably lied because of the easiest way to live now you're like oh yeah it can't be there I guess you can't you're a liar [noise]\nWhat\nDo you have to tell people to their faith you didn't live as much now I make up ... I'm like well I Can't because I have to be with a kid but I'll say something like ... making jam\nJust because it sounds more fun [laughter] I'm like oh let's have an interesting life Jay\nI'm making a big spread [noise] Hi Jay Larson a\nAlong with getting real one of the things that we value on this show is learning new things this is public radio after all of that and we are very excited this week debut are non accredited Institute of higher education we call it live wire you like it [noise]\nAgain the lawyers really want me to hit the non accredited part hard because like live where you makes Trump University looked like Harvard just that's the level of education you might get here this week uh Jay we've got a pop quiz for you know we've been talking about personal Montrose I've been talking about my new one we wanted to find out how much knowledge you had on the subject of ...\nSo I'm going to read you an actual monitor that someone has and then give you some possibilities and you have to guess\nWho's monitor it is we're calling this what's your monster a man\nOf the thing is this quiz end up taking too long our producer and time ... lawyer is going to play this bell\n[noise] which is not even a thing they do a college anymore probably but it's also the same sound for the fire alarm sort of something going on don't anyone panic we can all go down together\n[noise] All right so you're ready to do this ... here we go to give anything less than your best is the sacrifice the gift is that the ... of the runner Steve ... thank you for yelling it out\nIn the audience [noise] is that the monster of Martha Stewart\nOr is that the Montrose guy Feehery [noise]\nThink it's the Eddie I'm\nMartha Stewart went to jail by the way so she clearly wants to distance she was very competitive she was willing to sacrifice at it and I got yelled out pretty Fontaine I'll go with a guy who's not playing but playing in the audience you're a free Fontaine\nThey can with what they've got is that the ... of the current pope Pope Francis is that the mantra of\nThe star of pumped and that seventies show Ashton Kutcher or is that the monitor of football coach Vince Lombardi I think Vince Lombardi you couldn't be more wrong\nIs Ashton Kutcher Ashton Kutcher [noise] everyone is doing the best they can with what they got I looked at him for you know inspiration yeah\nOr don't be evil is the mantra of is it Superman is it noted NBC Sports commentator Bob Costas [noise]\nOr is it the corporation Google what was the thing again don't be evil is the ... one of those three\nGoals and can Bob Costas stopped dying as here do we know you're old I don't get it what do we not going to watch it to get a little gray I Can't feel any way I think it would cost is\nMeeting as Batman [noise] Superman by the\n... you're going to go with Google you\nAre going to be a hundred percent right that is the\nAuthor of Google remains to be seen if they're actually doing it but that is I guess their\nCorporate uh Montreal okay not all of us can do great things but we can do small things with great love is that the ... of golfer and mixed drink namesake Arnold Palmer [noise]\nIs that the ... of [noise]\nActor and comedian Tom Arnold [noise] or is that the monster of Mother Teresa\nI've worked with Tom Arnold and uh\nThat's definitely not as ...
