Arizona we are on the whole Bible\n\nAll winter long America salad comes from a narrow valley five miles wide and fifty meandering miles long it follows the Colorado River when I was there it was blazing hot oppressive when the weather turns cool to this place is perfect for growing crops\nMost of the farmers in Yuma did not really want to talk to me about the cola it is not a pleasant topic obviously\nOne farmer them he said come on over Steve Alameda big lettuce grower co owner of top flavor for [noise]\nI found it how are you I'm good how are you places amazing ball\nGot a plaid shirt and button issues these super friendly and super proud of what he does I said can you show me around he said sure Jesus shows me cotton fields hay field some date trees and acres of bare dirt that will turn into\nLettuce fields in the fall in another five months as all be green green all be green vegetables we can grow anything here well it's\nFor a grower would would what would I like this to will just be like being in the Silicon Valley I pointed to that\nI tell Steve that I Am on the trail of ... any of that yeah you and the whole FDA\nHe says there's a team of them poking around that valley testing the water that farmers and used to water their crops and schemes than might she knows exactly where they are like right now\nSo Mike takes my phone and he pulls up a map\nSo I'll jump in right here on the road and and where's the canal\nRight below him if the ...\nOut there I Am going to find it\nVery good thank you you do you do I hop in my rental car I head east it takes a while but eventually I find that there is other than an a white suburban nine people are standing along a concrete\nLine to ditch with water running along the bottom most of them look like grass to summer wearing blue latex gloves they have cooler high tech scientific equipment every so often one of them reaches down and fills a bucket with water\nHe says they can't tell me much about what they're doing out here it's very sensitive ... and a few hundred feet away there's another canal filled with water bigger [noise]\nFarmers use that water on their lettuce and right next to this water\nAs far as the eye can see thousands of them just standing there quiet\nQuiet they wouldn't make any noise say we didn't know\nAny way they're standing there on his bare dirt lined up alongside troughs filled with corn and\nHey eating not moving ...\nCattle the animal that most often carry you call I owe one side step and this is where ... comes from human sometimes but it's usually animals deer wild pig cows\nThis might be where the long search for the source of the contamination this might be where that search engines actually here goes a truck\nCarrying cattle manure out into the fields where it's composting driving right past is that [noise]\nThe FDA found he call I mean this wider canal the exact genetic strain that got everyone that\nTheir theory is that equal life on the cow manure washed into the irrigation ditch or blue and and then the contaminated water just flowed into all the vegetable fields across the valley\nI talk to Steve about this ditch he doesn't get his water from it but his lettuce farming friends do and they've actually been worried about these calls for a long time\n'cause they're just so close to the vegetables you got\nTo say a hundred thousand animals that [noise]\nThat are all culprits basically so you know ... if you'd be you'd be full not to not to have that pop in your head [noise] anyway\nBut like I say we're aware of it and we're we're always checking for it and looking and hoping that we can survive you know next to each other which we've done for sixty years\nAnd then\nAll of us are to something change something happened we that we [noise]\nWe need to know we need to know [noise]\nLet us growing season in human it's supposed to start up again in just a couple of months and Steve and his friends want to grow lettuce again but those cattle are still there and the farmers\nFarmers should do differently\nAnd the thing that really scares the farmers is the possibility that the people who buy their lead us the big supermarkets and processors maybe they will say we don't trust let us from Yuma anymore we won't buy it Bill Maher earlier the food safety lawyer says they should be worried\nIf there's another outbreak like this I mean a tough question for Wal Mart are tough question for Cosco is who I Do buy you know product from a place that you know always near a feedlot to just had an outbreak last year\nThat's a that's a very uncomfortable question that a lawyer gets to ask\nThe event ... fellow lettuce farm right they're trying to figure this out one way they're talking about is to treat the irrigation canal with chlorine to kill any equal lie\nBut they've also been talking about something more drastic maybe those cows are now just too much of a threat to the lettuce industry maybe the lettuce farmers have to band together and by the feedlot just to kick the cows out shut it down\nFor centuries farmers have raised their animals and their vegetables side by side but farming has reached such a scale now maybe they can't anymore\nMaybe this valley champagne fake enough for the\nBoth of them are Taos [noise]\nYou can send a story I wanted money at NPR dot org and we're also on Facebook Twitter and Instagram I'll put up some pictures from the trip\nToday was produced by at least that its guy saying and I like people are like Nick fountain edited and our last days are Alex gold mines and find that many\nThanks to China rocky Christina tan and care and democracy for their help with this episode dance for that kind of thing [noise]\nSo guy rises here to tell us what's coming up on how I built this yeah but the Internet I actually I'm\nStill having a hard time getting the image of a hundred thousand calories out of my head state a lot of cows yeah it is a huge amount of cows well anyway well today we're going to need a former Navy SEAL who needed a way to stay fit during these long deployments so he invented these exercise straps\nAnd then he realized he could sell them\nMe you know why go wrong the manufacturer that I had started with didn't have a depth of manufacturing experience in kind of product that I was bringing which is ...\nImage tore we ordered arrived and you know we've sold out of everything so of course we're out of ... by the time it arrived in desperate to ship [noise] well we hooked up the first ... lean back in the handles just crack like potato chips [noise]\nNPR how I built that showed that innovators entrepreneurs dealer stories behind the movement they built [noise]\nGuy riding on the show today how a former Navy SEAL turned an old jujitsu delved into a new spin this phenomenon called Iraq then nearly lived at all with\nIn his idea stick around for how I built this from NPR support for NPR comes from the station\nAnd from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking into capital markets expertise along with a legacy is putting clients financial well being first\nLearned more at Raymond James dot com\nAnd from the department of homeland security with e verify dedicated to providing employment eligibility verification for all businesses and the employees that helps them thrive at either verify dot Gov slash go\nHow I built this from NPR I'm Guy Raz It's unlikely you'll find a gym in America or for that matter in most parts of the world without DRA ... and if you're not familiar with them they're these heavy duty nylon straps that hang from an anchor in the ceiling with these foam rubber grips at the end\nTipping point one and then shortly thereafter I started to get exposed to some athletes [laughter]\nUm and ended up a connecting with a cat that probably most\nOf your listeners have heard of named Drew Brees very early in the in his career so before he became the super bowl champion quarterback for that for the saints before he became the Drew Brees that we all know today I mean he was the same guy then but you just didn't know about him and he had he had just torn his his rotator cuff and his throwing shoulder\nWhich ... quarterbacks tends to be a career and her\nAnd he had just been released from the chargers and was doing rehab and she fell in love with the suspension trainer wow thank goodness and he had a opportunity with Sports Illustrated early on to do a a story about his come back and he was very kind\nAnd you know just to sort of scratch my back made sure that the picture that they featured was him training on the suspense trash and all of a sudden\nAll the strength to condition and coaches and athletes that read Sports Illustrated got their eyes on this crazy strapping thought well maybe we have a couple of those ... you know the big challenge for somebody who's starting a venture and particularly if you've got a product for which there isn't precedent\nIt begins to avail themselves and you have to wrangle each one one at a time ... like ... for example one of the specific challenges that I faced early was\nThe manufacturer that I had started with who was a good guy\nBut didn't have a depth of manufacturing experience in kind of product that I was bringing which is this product has to be very durable and so one of the very early large lots of women tore we ordered arrived and you know we'd sold out of everything so of course we're out of stock by the time it arrived\nAnd desperate to ship but we hooked up the first ... lean back in the handles just crack like potato chips and it turns out that this manufacturer\nAnd had gone to a sub manufacture and found somebody who would do\nThe sub component is more cheaply and so we ended up having to manually strip these things apart and set up in a basically an assembly line you know with a band saw went and got\nA bunch of ah plumbing pipe from Home Depot and literally had to set up this little you know manufacturing a plant if you will in our little office there\nAnd that was inefficient protests say the least\nBut we managed to work our way through and survived it\nShe'll say you have this this product on in the world and I would think that once\nYou start to become successful uh there would be knock us I mean it would be other companies that that that oh well this we can just crush this guy 'cause we can just make a similar thing and and make it cheaper or whatever\nYeah that that is the single biggest problem that I have faced in my career as an entrepreneur and frankly it's a it's a problem that is ...\nYou know the entire consumer products space these days um it started with us literally about six or seven years into our evolution I had somebody call me and say I think I just saw counterfeiter acts and I said that's impossible that's impossible right\nAnd it turned out that are in fact\nThe rise of the Internet was changing everything and it was creating an environment in which these little manufacturers over in you know rural China\nSuddenly had visibility over products that seemed to be hot so if you have a one size fits all say for instance a Gucci\nCost of goods you end up being a perfect target and we had an explosion of counterfeiting that just rolled across the market and really be threatened to sue cause us to fail\n\nComing up and how the legal battle again copycats buried Randy and bills and almost said the company you're listening to how I built this from NPR stay with us\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station\nAnd from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed of financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement\nMore it alliance for lifetime income dot org from the ... foundation expanding opportunities in American cities to regret making and social investing\nMore at ... dot org and from let's say like you who donate to this NPR stations\nHey we'll come back to how I built this from NPR guy rod\nSo it's two thousand and ten and ... is catching on with professional athletes then spreading to gyms across the country\nThe problem is the exercise traps are also popular with counterfeiters and the knockout start eating into the company's bottom line so Randy decides to hire an investigator to figure out just how many counterfeiters are out there\nDating fake counterfeit uh tiara ... suspension trainers foul and yeah it was it was really it was a it was a shock and it put huge pressure on the entire business model so so how did what did you do how did you wash he's these guys were eating into your business\nThey were devouring my business I um I think that I was fortunate in that it was the early stages where people were starting on the enforcement side we're starting to get a sense that hey this counterfeiting business is bad and we're going to have to do something about it so customs was starting to ramp up its efforts\nAnd fortunately counterfeiting you know is a felony so\nWhen you identify them everyone wants to take them down\nUm and so we started this process of seizures in China with the cooperation at some level with Chinese police so that sort of started to subside but what replaced it was that the counterfeiters figured out\nIf we don't put this brands trademark on our product then it's technically not a counterfeit and so it becomes\nMuch harder to enforce against and that was the next big wave was the knock offs\nThat were copying our designs to the table\nBut not calling themselves TR acts that he became an a bigger problem ... will how what happened what Amazon um and the other online marketplaces but particularly Amazon because of its scale\nUp became this hotbed if you will or an auction site for all of these knock off vendors and who would misappropriated\nAre trademarks use them in search marketing\nAnd so when you for instance guy came looking for T. R. acts on Amazon you would be served up our product alongside a host of others and others that are accorded the price of fits the prime cause of course they're not having to spend any money to develop the market or get you there yeah\nWe really experienced a flattening and actually a negative growth for a couple of years twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen wow as the CFPB knock offs are confused the market [noise] lucky you are\nAn alpha male you were a steal your demand the guy but I mean let's be honest\nNo way you didn't experience um anxiety or depression or like the er [noise]\nBecause there there was a period of time when I was thinking well I could make these guys go away\n[laughter] right I have a certain skill set and I you know then you have to look away from the light quickly and say no no no no no this is not where your brain should go you know I I learned some skills as a steel\nAbout how to manage fear and stress and it sort of involves a combination of compartmentalize Haitians and action and so that's how I kind of you know deal with a entrepreneurial\nFearing stress is you know you put it in a box figure out how you can take action on it and then you move forward to your next task at hand and hope that you know that fix works", "show_name": "On the Media", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "04"}
