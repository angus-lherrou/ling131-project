Planet Money the other day\nTurned on my recorder and I kind of started her\nMaybe we should say uh\nWhere are you [noise] ah this is Cathy I'm Sorry I don't know if you want me to get my name is yeah [noise]\nThe easy question I I'm Catherine Rampell him at home watching\nThe typically Catherine writes about the economy the Washington Post and it occurred to us that actually a coffee shop is perfect place to show this thing that in your\nSo you're looking at an icy what size looking for\nAnd I can see now I see\nMuch money was spent on the board to eighty nine\nAre a little misleading okay\nOkay so maybe that sounds like somebody buying iced tea and then having to pay tax but it only sounds normal because we've gotten used to it\nWith Catherine sees here is one price on the board\nAnd then this extra hidden thing that she has to pay for it and it's not just taxes sometimes it's Steve in service charges that seemed to appear out of thin air at check out and drive us all crazy looking rental cars buying concert tickets for like have you looked at a hotel room recently sometimes\nThere's an Internet feed sometimes in the parking fee sometimes there is something called a resort fee even though you're staying in a place that is not a resort it's by the way anyway Catherine brought her iced tea into the studio to explain why these fees and service charges or not just annoying they are bad for the economy\nCompany should be competing based on price and quality and not altercation ah and the fact that companies to compete on application did not create a better economy does not create or got better experience for consumers and can in fact raise prices for consumers that are buying stuff that they don't want\nIt's like every one is a used car sales [laughter]\nI have a very good friend who's a used car salesman and so I I don't want to denigrate that profession specifically\nSo what is your one tiny tweak it would change the world\nMy my one tiny tweak is that we should require more all inclusive upfront pricing including taxes fees particularly in common types of consumer purchases where people like to comparison shop\nThe price should be the price [noise]\nThat is how Catherine Rampell\nI'm Kenny Malone and sometimes on Planet Money we tackled the world's big questions but today on the show we look\nFor small dancers yeah this is something we've done here before we called the smartest people we know and we asked them\nWhat TV thing would you change about the world to make our lives better we have a suggestion for how you can get more money from ... how to make the most boring sport little less boring and how to take down the wedding industrial complex\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from transfer a wise or

data\nWe looked at a hundred thousand games now many a hundred thousand we went back to Nineteen sixty seven fifty years okay and we analyzed each pitch for over a hundred thousand games and asked if the catch approve of been in place how would things have changed\nAs an inpatient baseball fan how much shorter\nWith these games are bed the average game which now about three hours in five minutes would be cut by twenty four minutes while you're cutting almost a half an hour from a game and a half an hour was the game yes\nAnd not only were the games shorter said we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with it's declining attendance\nSo how have\nFans reacted to this teeny tiny tweak to America's pastime [noise] well a critically I Would say [laughter] let's just say a there has been a lot of angry baseball fans but Steve is not here to win a popularity contest\nIn fact he tells that he's also got a version of the catch up rule for America's actual favorite sport football\nIn the NFL we would give the winning team only three downs rather than for down to make a first down\nSteve you were like you're blowing up every single sport\nSo yeah we have an idea for basketball that we would instead of giving the team ahead twenty four seconds to shoot we'd be them only Eighteen seconds at the end of the game\nHome like how you are a true iconoclast well [laughter] we'll see what happens we don't want to hold you or any longer thank you so much for coming in yeah thank you professor thanks very much\nAnd don't go to any baseball games anytime

coming up next on how I felt that\nWelfare state we're going to Gary Hertzberg east mainly resilient businessmen who's organic yogurt company had its share of near death experiences on many occasions\nI Would tip toe over to the office to call my mother in law\nTo have a chance to see if I could borrow another thirty five hundred and twenty five hundred to make ends meet and one night I heard the click click a call waiting on my mother in law that's on I'm Meg was calling from the house to say mom don't do that what your wife\nWas telling her mom not to lend you money for the business right because it sounds like she maybe she didn't believe in well she had no reason to believe in it it was insane [noise]\nFrom NPR how I built that showed that innovators entrepreneur Vila stories behind\nI'm Guy rod that on today's show them how to game the farmers and accounting literally now started at night and then when I ran the barn and really just don't have one of the biggest

information I build on dot a W s\nAnd from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed of financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement more at alliance for lifetime income dot org it's how I built this from NPR I'm\nGuy riding so of all the stories that we've told on this show so far I think it's fairly safe to say that stony field yogurt and has had more ups and downs and really more down then just about any other it's pretty unlikely tail to begin\nTo eat go hippie farmers with no real desire to build a company wind up building a company they start small milking the cows making their own yogurt shelling locally to none and then eventually spreading themselves way too\nThin and sliding into deep dad you know over the years Tony Hilton headache bowls and blew up near death experiences\nBut it never quite guided in fact in grew\nAnd grew into one of the most popular yogurt brand in the United states and one thing about Tony Fields cofounder Gary Hertzberg is that even though he didn't really set out to build a company he knew what it took to run one because when he was growing up in Manchester New Hampshire is dad owned and ran a pretty big shoe company\nYou know it it was a in those days they were probably fifty shoe manufacturers in New Hampshire alone and probably a hundred and fifty in New Hampshire Maine and Vermont and\nSo as to how many people did your dad's company employ\nSeveral thousand I think at their peak they were at the twenty eight hundred wow these are two company town of course in those days manufacturing was a you know the state was built in in the region in the country where we're built on things that we made\nThe dark side of that is that when they especially because of a cheaper labor from abroad when the domestic shoe industry collapsed [noise] you know all the communities that as well and what happened to your family\n[noise] ah well it was really a three three per [noise] uh the family's business uh went bankrupt or my parents got divorced\nAnd my uh sort of childhood role model has died suddenly of spinal meningitis so it was a\nIt was a wake up here\nSo I had to sort of confront all of that and yeah you know my mom became a single mom with five kids I was the oldest so dislike\nMajor change in your life happens at the age of fourteen which of course it's going to have an impact an influence on you did you did you start to think about a business about being a businessman at that early I mean you say your parents were both entrepreneurial [noise]\nNo I I started to think about running as far as I possibly could away from it [noise]\nYou know I obviously the bankruptcy didn't happen overnight it was the result of a steady decline and my my grandfather my father and my uncle we're all in the business and I used to sit or work there and I would listen\nTo them screaming at each other you know they were arguing you know uh [laughter]\nI'm passionately\nOr about what to do about this downturn and so to me business was the thing\nWhere people got people yelled at each other people hung up funds on each other people were stressed or employees lost their jobs and it and on top of that serious a pollution so it led to my deciding that business was the worst thing on the planet the last thing I should I wanted to do and led\nMe to really pursue a career in the science ... environmental\nSo so what'd you do after high school\nI went off to college that was just\nA pet over an old vertically liberal arts are sort of non business environment it was Hampshire\nColorado yes right which in which of course Ken Burns and you want to get business knocked out of you that's where you yeah right yeah but stick with it because it turns out that it was probably the best training for an entrepreneur that there is because this is a school that has no credits no requirement no grades you only passed\nMatriculate through by contracting and making progress with a individual professors who take you on is there\nA centrally apprentice and and in many cases the funding of of work I mean I wound up diving deep into ecology and environmental sciences\nSee I I guess it was after college that you went and worked on an organic farm yeah\nCash for not daily casualty I kept hourly cash so I knew on a Wednesday morning how much money had to come in that afternoon [noise] in order for us because by then the\nGuy had figured out from you know Sammy I wasn't paying them so now we're a very short terms with everybody [noise]\nI mean my fundraising skills turned out to be you know maybe we'll be nowhere without Samuels yogurt making skills and his family's unbelievable attention to detail they were perfectionist up but we were also we would also be nowhere\nWithout my ability to keep getting credit and cash because it was burning [noise] I mean we were on him [noise]\nWe come back in just a moment how Garry ... spaniel beg to borrow to keeps Tony Fields going and how they almost lost it anyway again and again and again I'm Guy rise and you're listening to how I felt\n\n\nSupport for NPR

currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore it transfer wise dot com or from their app\nPay will come back to how I built this from NPR I'm Guy Raj so in the summer of Nineteen eighty four Gary and Daniel andme stony field are almost broke their basically running on fumes and they're trying to bring in more money by just finding a few more stores to sell their yogurt\nThose days a whole foods didn't exist yet but the holy grail for natural products was a little three store chain called bread and circus which eventually became part a hopeless\nAnd they had one store in Cambridge prospects drink and you know we were selling now to Jim Lewis market basket just as now I'm Talking July of eighty four\nAnd um and we were desperately trying to get down there because we knew that if we can crack bread and circus every other little natural foods co up in New England would then take us in\nAnd we kept going down there and and they said no no no we've already got you know a hippie yogurt made by somebody in Vermont to ... in the TPP with their wet\nWhat you guys do so in July of eighty four I had my thirtieth birthday at the farm and my I had my old ultimate Frisbee team um come up to visit me most of whom lived in Cambridge as you might imagine\nAnd um I said look it's wonderful you've outcome if you want to give me a really good birthday present good under bread and circus prospects in Cambridge and asked for my yoga and that was on a Sunday on Wednesday Mary Carol Skinner the buyer of bread and circus called into Garry I don't know what's going on but demand is suddenly gone through the\nRoof or getting all kinds of requests for you to get it when when you can you get it in there well I got in my car and I made the first deliberate that afternoon [noise] um about\nA month later we were her number one selling yogurt\nOr she took us in the other two bread and circuses and awfully went but it was my Frisbee team I mean you know that's what it takes I you know I always say we can ship the yogurt three thousand miles this last\nEighteen Inches that makes all the different if you get it and people smiled and then they're going to ask for an end run around the time you meet magazine would become your wife right yeah so\nA month after that fateful meeting with bread and circus we had our summer no pecan for northeast organic farming association conference and I I as it turned out I was the keynote speaker and uh right after I finished\nMy speech this very adorable or organic farmer from\nJersey who is running her own nonprofit farm down there I waited patiently to ask me a question well that turned out to be what is now my thirty one year wife Meg and her mom had been the deputy commissioner of agriculture for New York state so she had a kind of an ag orientation um\nAt one point she kind of whisper to me that she'd be okay with a if I needed some money with lending me some well of course that needed money so she loan to a fifty thousand dollars [laughter]\nI started raising and I I got to about two Seventy five three hundred ... a sort of a month or so later she said well I think we can increase so she increase to a hundred and eventually I got across the finish line got the five hundred ... you know venture capitalists are the reason they want\nWhat they called F enough money first friends and family money mhm it's because they know that you might as an entrepreneur if things get rough you you might just get up and walk away if it's you know some Harvard MBA with with with a tie but if it's your mother's money yeah and so we worked for our moms which\nTed payroll on Thursday mornings at at this point of the half a million dollar business and I never had cash in the bank that night before payroll never just this is became our way of life and so I think in ... was a sleep in our bedroom which is about fifty feet from my office I Would\nOn many occasions tip toe over to the office to call my mother in law to have a chance to see if I could borrow another thirty five hundred and twenty five hundred to make ends meet\nAnd eventually make got onto this and one night I heard the click click a call waiting on my mother in law is on and make was calling from the house to say mom don't\nDo this what your wife was telling her mom not to lend you money for the business right because I was because she didn't have confidence it looks she's living in a nightmare me she saw\nHow crazy it was I mean we had chimney fires we had the well pump would go out that the power which I mean we're on the hilltop farm a long way\nFrom anywhere was make thank you looking to ditch the bag it I mean or or did you get this sounds like maybe she didn't believe in it [noise] well she had no reason to believe in it it was insane but why did you believe in did you think you are you are what two or three years into this thing\nAnd it not only are you making money you are in debt\nBig the big time yeah [noise] well I'll say that [noise] um [noise] make a you know fortunately loved me even more forcefully probably love the yogurt and we're nowhere else to go [noise]\n\nYou know she had given up her job done on a farm in New Jersey has signed on to this crazy damn enterprise [noise] but here's where the story is I Know that you think you couldn't get worse but it has a Lily Tomlin says it\nIt it it would it it got a lot worse before it got worse okay what ... what happened\nWell so now I'm going to jump a year and a half we've now expanded the plant were buying milk from ten or twelve farms\nAnd we have maxed out this little farm there is no you cannot squeezed another drop of yogurt out of this place so\nPresumably you are looking to to work with another factory right spring of eighty six we are out of capacity we contracted with a little dairy in western Massachusetts Greenfield mass\nWe were desperate we did not do any of the financial due diligence one would\nDo what happen for us was their bank went in and put 'em in the chapter seven padlocked implied locked it up wait a minute your\nStopped [noise] so it came to a screaming halt now we have no factory you're making yogurt and we have no yoga ... what was in the factory\nWill do what could we do we took a look at the old yoga work up on the hilltop farm [noise] and I put on our carpenters aprons when um [noise] had kicked the roosters out ten restarted the old factory [noise] you know\n... it's kind of crazy to get at this point in in ... interviews normally it's or talking about how the entrepreneur like made it through the process and a\nCrucible and just you know just start making money hand over fist but you are still in crisis I mean your company is not doing well then you you you didn't even have a factory to make yogurt at this point you you needed a new one\nYeah and and we all Timothy found one or it was a dairy and northern Vermont and we drove up to Vermont when I got there Sam it went into the rest room
