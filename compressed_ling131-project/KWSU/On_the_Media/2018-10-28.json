the right call oh we've also got comedian Emily ... here and we have got music from Portland zone he Leo the Clintons\nLetting go is something that I tend to have a hard time with it whether the topic is something really big or even something kind of small in fact on my way to record this episode of live wire I had\nA like a little run in at the airport\nI had a hard time letting go up I was telling our announcer Elaine ... about it at the beginning of the show on let's actually pick it up right there on stage at the Alberta rose theater in Portland, Oregon tickle us\nToday this very day I was in the airport is flying down here to do the show and I went through security and my bag was passing through the scanner and it got flagged\nThey made an announcement over the loudspeaker we need somebody to look at this bag they pulled it out they took everything out of the bag wiped it all down and couldn't figure out why the scanner went off\nBottle and it had and I'm not exaggerating five molecules of water still in it\nLike I had actively dumped out the water but there was some residue in there and the guy said yeah you can't have that water wow and I looked at him and I said you know for the safety of this flight I Am willing to dump out the water\nAnd I'm not going to take it on a plane with me or so where do I do that and he said security rules are you can't do that on this side of security\nYou have to go back out to the other part of the airport [noise] dumped pure water out\nAll five molecules get back in line and then come back through security\nBut he said he said or you can just leave the water bottle here\nBut I just bought it it was like twenty dollars [laughter] I'm pretty sure this is a scam by the TSA to get free water bottles and free per plus over three ounces\nBecause there's always just like dead soldiers lined up\nFrom people who didn't want to and I was like you know what I'm putting the system on trial I Am going to do this I'm going to take the

it's not me\nNo I'm terrible oh All right well I'm kind of good at it just because I forget everything and that my ... you know my goldfish memory sort of house I'm fortunately I don't think a lot of people in our audience are great at life who says\nOh yeah we we passed out with um audience cards and we asked people about ah something they've had a hard time letting go people here in the Alberta rose theater and they filled those out um and you've got some of those with you all and which ones would you like to share with that oh\nBecause that conversation happened in the hall of South

we asked the audience here at the Alberta rose theater in Portland or to tell us about something they've had a hard time letting go of and you end up past rollout you've been collecting those up what are you seeing a\nYou had a hard time letting go of four pounds of bacon in my freezer [noise] it's been there for you\nWith like four exclamation point after it [laughter]\nI can totally relate to that there's a part of my freezer that humanize have not even be able to look upon it for the last six years it's just frozen over I think there is some old drum sticks like not like the band was using but like ice cream cones there might be like a Trader Joe's Indian the annoying down in the bottom of it\nNo ice cream would ever had fallen to freezer disrepair and my house really yeah no I mean really you don't even need a freezer when you bring home ice cream\nAnd I have to get them or do you have one more yeah here's one from I I think didn't uh\nThan in a has\nHad a hard time letting go of over thinking it took me twenty minutes to decide on this [laughter]\n[noise]\nI was in it is here with whoever spilled wine on their car [laughter] that would be a good combination [noise]\nThis is live wire radio we are talking about letting go this week what about the idea of letting go basically everything that you were raised to believe that is exactly what a guy named Derek Black did when he decided to turn his back\nOn wait for it the white nationalist movement it was a movement his father helped create\nHis journey of letting go is detailed in a series of articles in the Washington Post by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist ... now you just turn those articles into a book titled arising out of hatred please welcome ... [noise]\n[noise]\nYou know I was going to live wire thanks great to be here um how did you first meet this guy dark black\nSo I was writing about doing real for the Washington Post and Dylann Roof it committed the hate crime murder of about a dozen people at a historically black church in Charleston South Carolina\nAnd Dylann Roof it spent time on this website called storm front and which I had heard of but I didn't know very much about so and trying to understand the things that doing referred been reading to sort of motivated him\nFor the massacre I went on storms front and started reading this site it's the largest racist website in the world and has been for two decades running\nAnd the biggest threat on his Web sites that there were plenty of people saying you know horrible we celebrate towards things about Dylann Roof but the biggest threat was about somebody named ...\nAir to not only this website but also to this movement in the United states he was the son is the founder of this message board the godsend if David Duke he'd been raised\nA David Duke for those of you who fortunately don't know who that is yeah you're lucky he's a former grand wizard of the KKK\nThe ... and he had sort of made this guy dark black his protege and Derek being really smart ambitious had been disastrously successful in mainstreaming a lot of these terrible idea she'd been elected to office by the time he was Twenty years old he had a\nDelighted to what kind of office\nTo a Republican committee seats and Florida in Florida\nIn West Palm Beach Florida which is a pretty diverse place uh\nLet me ask you a little bit about this sort of storm front thing and how are related to this movement between what a lot of people would call white supremacy or the idea of being a white supremacist\nAnd something called the white nationalism because I Would think those are the same thing but actually dirt blacks dad was a big part of trying to move from white supremacy to white nationalism what's the difference\nSure they've worked really hard to change the language of this movement to try to sanitize it from a history of bloodshed but I think the truth distinction that is helpful between white supremacy and white nationalism is white supremacy unfortunately is endemic to what the United States has been historically and his today and\nWe're all still living in a country that was built unfortunately on a lot of white supremacist ideals white nationalists I think properly identifies\nA smaller group of people who are trying to separate races on two different continents as their end goal\nBut like the idea to was that this guy dark black his father founded this website and was trying to make kind of an intellectual argument like be this sort of thinking persons racist\nYeah I mean he Derek father had also been the head of the clan for a decade in the United states and and eventually you decided it was more effective to build a gigantic website and eventually to ban all slurs from that website there's no knock the insignia no racial slurs\nWhat they've tried to do is instead of speaking all the time horrible things about people with color and Jews is instead they're trying to speak to unfortunately in a fairly widespread and factually incorrect sense of grievance that exists in part of white America\nI'm this kid they're black and I just kind of a passive observer to this like his dad is starting this website and he is going into forums on the Internet and popularized in his words like white genocide and things like that when did he\nHe went to college and the kids Derek in many ways had been indoctrinated with a lot of these ideas everybody who he lived us believe these things and has made it the college for their lives and they pulled Derek out at the public schools and kept him sort of in the confines of white nationalism\nAnd not for his childhood existed he was the keynote speaker at all these white nationalist conferences\nFrom the time he was ten years old so only in the first time that he got out of that world and began bumping into the people who are often the victims and his prejudices\nDid any of his ideas begin to shift and that was when he was Twenty one years old went to the best college and the cheapest college in Florida happened to be a super liberal place which Derek didn't quite realize until they got their hands\nPretty quickly on campus realize that if people knew who he was he would be ostracized\nAnd and shame pretty quickly so for the first year on campus he led the secret life where he would leave the dorms every morning we've all of his friends and go out to a quiet place on campus and have a two hour radio show with his father\nRailing against like the multi cultural take over America and then you would go back onto this diverse campus and a friend who ever walked by and and that lasted for a four year\nSo I joined a gym my gym membership came with a free personal training session and I was like oh well that sounds like that sucks [laughter] ah but it was free so I went and I said listen here's what we're gonna do you're going to show me how to use these machines without blocking my head\nAnd then you and I are going to part ways for the rest of our lives [noise]\nAnd he said I totally get it but first we do need to do a questionnaire about your fitness goal and I was like oh I feel like it should be clear from that last thing I said\n[noise] that I Do not have fitness goal [noise] my\nGoal was to join a gym and I did that already so I kinda feel like taking the rest of the year off if I'm being on a [noise]\nAnd he was like it's not that big a deal I just want you to tell me what it is you're hoping to get out of this and I was like okay I guess I Would like to improve my posture my stamina\nMy general energy level and he goes okay great and your goal weight and I was like oh I'm not a political [noise]\nAnd he was like you don't want to lose weight and I was like no I did not and he got this look on his face told me that what he was thinking was but I can see you\nUm [noise]\nJoking and it's nothing against any of you if\nYou want to lose weight there's nothing wrong with that I think I used to want to do that when I was younger and then what happened was I gained forty pounds and then I started making a lot of money and having a lot of sex\n[noise]\nWe is why that happened and\nLooking in the mirror [noise]\nThere's nothing you want to change [noise] I was\nLike I don't know maybe like the person I'm Talking to you right now\n[noise] [noise] he got\nPut it this way he's very frustrated at this point let me put it this way if you lost weight would that be okay with you\n[noise] and at that\nPoint it was clear to me that he was not going to let me leave there in July admitted to him that I was flying from the Ghostbusters [noise] so I decided to throw 'em a bone I was like I'll give you this ever since I put on weight I've got a little bit more meat in my neck is made breathing a little bit harder than it used to be from certain positions when I'm lying down on the couch [noise]\nI guess that improved I'd be

forever and I met a million monster was the worst there was like trying to be Super Mario it was just like monster after a monster or just like turtle mushroom wizard just like over and over and
