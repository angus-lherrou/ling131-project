farm in Wisconsin Andy is still in the dairy world\nThey are able to milk the cow by hand\nUh we'll probably or you know close to a hundred percent are able but Ninety nine point nine percent wouldn't have before you get started\nIn the pantheon of milk related economic disasters there is one that rises above the rats and Andy had it ringside seats to it\nThis is one of those slow moving train wreck that you can see coming from a mile away\nIt was Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter was running for president and he started flooding this idea\nOf how many of them have bomb went off\nA bomb on one\nOf the ways Carter proposed giving farmers an equal break was to raise the price of milk by about six cents per gallon which was kind of a lot at the time\nYeah it certainly was on the edge of that it was a big enough number that it sounded like one of these campaign promises that you really didn't expect they would actually fulfill\nCampaign promise that's what we call does yeah there you go it's not just political pandering there is an argument that our country has to be able to produce its own sued because they are farmers to go out of business and we become reliant on other countries for food then that is a kind of national security risk\nAnd it's our country has a tradition of programs to help farmers but what do you need to talk of its new is that it's one thing to provide stability is another step into the market in a big way maybe the wrong time because playing with price controls he's playing with fire\nNevertheless when Carter got elected he goes all in\nThe retail price of milk was going up more than six cents a gallon to going up because the government\nAnd you you hear of it and he likes back here for a boy here we go\nIt was pretty hard to predict that it would just as bad as God but every instinct I had said this is much closer is going to work out so [noise]\nAnd welcome to Planet Money I can ... and I'm Kenny Malone today on the show the

at ... dot com and from Americans for the arts\nSo it's Nineteen Seventy seven Jimmy Carter has announced his plan to help farmers in Congress has like wait no we also love the farmers and so they pass a law saying that they want the price of milk to go up automatically every six months it's one thing for politicians to say we want the price of milk to go out\nAnyway so you're not hurting the market as much but the problem\nAndy said was that a lot of this was not easy to give away cheese there were forty pound block than five hundred pound barrels\nSo you can imagine you know you don't just kind of rules on one of these barrels down a seventh avenue in New York City and say anybody wants to cheat you just have a big knife yeah there you go to help yourself\nSo instead the cheddar cheese was process that helps that keep longer and then it was repackaged in two and five pound like bricks\nAnd this is what people will remember as a government cheese because when government starts to get away hundreds of millions of pounds of cheese people now that\nThe great cheese give away began today in California San Francisco was one of three cities in which needy people lined up to get the surplus this footage one who is amazing style massive crowds of people being handed bricks that or she is at a time of the most of the government packaging you will ever see just like brown

... I hate to you know Belviq is okay it's got it's OK okay we're we're not here to men but I'm not running down bell veto but I'll tell you that the government process loaf was ten times a hundred times better than it was some of it almost feels like natural cheddar I mean it was really really good product\nIs why there is also a community of people who are still obsessed with government cheese Internet chat board trying to find something comparable restaurants claiming they have a recipe for it\nAt one point Donny Walberg of the new kids on the block said quote there's nothing like it the way it melts for a hamburger\nThere is nothing better [noise]\nKen's doing the dance Cary doing dance strain but here is like government she has become a kind of terrible of how government intervention in markets can have like butterfly effect in Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter got on stage and said something seemingly innocuous\nBut I haven't found them\nAnd then within five years the government was spending billions of dollars filling caves with cheese that they could not get rid of fast enough\nWell I think there's there's two basic questions\nAgain economist Andy ... which one\nIs it's really hard to balance what you want to do socially or politically with what you can get away with economically the second lesson as you got to pay attention to the unintended consequences because they can come back and bite you in budget hard\nEven if that bite just looks like some delicious cheese [laughter] when I mean that was the unintended consequences it was fun but the bike came in terms of how much it cost for that I rented very very expensive she's been to\nThe government cheese caves started to empty out the guaranteed milk price which had been going up automatically every six months was eventually frozen but that does not mean the government had fix the problem\nIs the thing about price controls that once you start then they are really really hard to unwind\nSo we have a you know the cement surplus and now you have the political problem how do we how do we can this cat out of the tree\nThe government asked the economists including ... to figure out how it could get out of the cheese buying business\nThe government was demanding an unnatural amount of milk and farmers were supplying an unnatural amount of milk\nOne part of the solution then was to gently get that milk supply down\nTo persuade farmers to produce less we literally paid them money to stop producing milk\nThat did some good and then on the other side the government tried to replace some of their artificial demand for milk with new real demand for milk\nLike have people of America wouldn't you like to drink more milk\nWe took a small amount of money from every dairy farmer collected on every ... years old and we've created the national dairy board but this was what gave us a you know the got milk milk mustache and all those kind of iconic programs that we remember\nThat is right Jimmy Carter's campaign promise to help farmers in Nineteen Seventy six not only gave US government cheese but also milk mustaches\nWith a few other programs and sometimes things eventually got under control and the government put the milk support program on a kind of permanent expansion these days if the government wants to help farmers we don't generally hear about our direct subsidies as opposed to buying cheese yes\nThe the government has tended to stay away from buying cheese a solution that is until last July\nThe White House is coming to the eight of farmers hurt by his own hardline trade policies that Trump Administration says today it will make an estimated twelve billion dollars in government assistance available\nThe Trump Administration announced that in order to help farmers being hurt by Trump's tariffs the government may be making some food purchases again and then in August we learn some of the details there's currently about eighty five million dollars earmarked to buy dairy and distributed to places like schools and food\nBank that'd be fair that's probably not enough to start building caves which again but they're
