Burbank hope you're having a good week we have an exceptional show in store for you\nKnow we've got gas like Jose Antonio Vargas who has a Pulitzer Prize also Courtney how my sister who used to be the host of this actual radio show she's back splits\nComedy from Marcella are whale and amusing from planes on paper all of the folks on the show this week have faced their fears in one way or another and men announcer Elena ... started things off by talking\nAbout some of the things that we are afraid of that we have a hard time facing so let's pick things up on stage at the Alberta rose theater in Portland, Oregon\n[noise]\nThe personality types that when something is intimidating me when I'm afraid of dealing with something I just avoid it when my wife and I got married and she noticed that my policy for dealing with bills was waiting for the color of the ... to change my\n'cause a lot of people don't notice like they'll mail you the first few bills will be in a white on below ... and then when they want to escalate things to to your to the ... turned yellow\nMy policy is if it's yellow let a mellow [noise] they will eventually send you a red on below [laughter] which is like hours before the power goes out or something [laughter]\nWas like looking at this stack of multicolored ... going what\nAfraid of I just I I don't know that it was going to be more money than I wanted to pay it just was I Would see the envelope I Would think that doesn't seem pleasant to\nInteract with that reality right now\nWhen I could go check Twitter [laughter] well like I I don't know a couple of months ago I intercepted a letter that was from the IRS addressed to me and my life and it said\n... I had from like two years ago all of this and claimed income who am I going to like income that I had not told the the IRS I get emotional even thinking about it [laughter]\nAnd I did not want to deal with it nor did I Know how to deal with it and it was a substantial amount of money and I just had this ... and I took it into my office and I put it under something [laughter]\nThat was how I dealt with it\nTwo or three days I was just walking around the house with this thing just crushing me with stress uh my wife would go like you know I don't know if any of you do this but you have a really intense shock going on in your mind you're really worried and your partner will say what are you thinking about and for some reason you go nothing [laughter]\nWay of the world on me but I'm like oh no soon so finally I had to tell her about it because I didn't know what else to do and she looked at it and she was like oh no we we claimed all that that's a clerical error and then she just opened a spreadsheet on her laptop\nAll of it and all of the documentation oh my God she called them and they were like yeah that's\n[noise] and my plan like if I were\nNot married to her I wouldn't be hosting the show right now I Would be in Canada\nThat was my plan [laughter] burn my fingertips off and start over [laughter] I just like all of\nMy fears could be addressed by somebody showing me on a spreadsheet and everything's fine like what a keeper you ended\nUp I don't really I really I kicked my coverage with this one but the last [noise] honestly\nIt was so much better when we just addressed it yeah and that is something I'm Still I'm Still learning about I Would have really put it off indefinitely until it got worse and worse and worse and so I I'm hoping that by the end of this hour of learnt at least something about facing my fear is\nIt was really the only piece of ID I had\nThanks to Oregon and it was expiring on February third two thousand eleven which was precisely may thirtieth birthday and so it was like this tell tale heart kind of clock being inside of me going like okay what are we gonna do at that\nI was writing for the New Yorker I just finished my first documentary you know whatever I was living in your some of the choices was I either self deport\nThanks to Mitt Romney for that race and actually my original plan was to leave because you know I haven't seen my mom since I was twelve um so I haven't you know she sent me here I haven't seen her fly um she can't even come into tourist visa because she doesn't own property she's not a college graduate that tells you a lot about class and race\nOr I I stay and again I'm totally fine if I had to like be a janitor or babysitting\nDoing that but I ended up being a writer and really the only reason I became a journalist was so I could write my way into the newspaper\nBecause it was my way of physically feeling like I was here so I think the whole time I was just carrying a lot of guilt like how can I be in the business of truth telling if I'm lying about who I Am where you were going to carrying guilt or were you carrying\nUm anxiety or both I think it was and the way to compartmentalize that is you just you know thankfully I don't know how it happened and I I could have got him to draw from an alcoholic but instead I'm just like I'm just going to work work work work work and you know you know people say that people like me should arm\nOr citizenship you mean people who who are undocumented yeah like you know whenever they talk about immigration reform do like hey they should earn their citizenship so I actually convince myself but I have to do that which meant that I had to get this really you know good resume and then they realize like earning what have you done\nTo her citizenship [laughter] absolutely nothing\nTo kind of turned the tables around like if we were actually you know apparently there's a hundred and fifty thousand undocumented people in the state of Oregon if you were actually to compare what citizenship and I would argue that undocumented people exhibit of greater amount of citizenship that you could possibly imagine [noise]\n\nAround everybody and say like hey have you proving your worst what have you done I don't want to do that that's rude [laughter] totally rude [laughter] I don't want to do that and I just want us to be able to figure out how we can share this base together and like what it means that\nLives you know where to vote for each other\n[noise]\nWe're talking to Jose Antonio Vargas um that in his book is deer America notes of an undocumented citizen I'm from the time when this was basically a secret that you were sort of keeping or at least not many people knew too when you publicly declared that you were undocumented\nOr how has your life changed our you less anxious now are you more anxious I mean certainly the current administration is probably not helping for you but like what was it what's the difference in your life before and after you went public with this information\nOr the biggest thing is the moment I came out of undocumented I knew that I was only one story one story right and because I'm I look like these people are going to project on to me just good immigrant model mine or to stop doing that by the way it can be stopped\nDefining American dot com please check it out and out and play Eighteen people which is amazing but just to check just how crazy our immigration system is so I can employ people and provide good health benefits insurance that I Can't get myself\nKind of twisted isn't\nSo I started organization and they're not the Trump got elected president I was living in downtown LA and the building manager texted me and said hey Jose it um I don't know what we would do is I showed up\nIf we can protect him so when he said that\nIt kind of crystallized for me what my own situation was so they can't pretend that my life has been and always been in limbo so I packed a beating up on storage and I've been living I have\n... cents so I actually wrote the book while I was in hotel rooms and are being bees and friends' houses because [noise] I just kind of have to face what it means to be in this kind of ...\nWhat is the future look like for you I mean uh uh do you think you'll be able to live out your days in America or do you think it's it's a sort of a likelihood that you'll end up getting deported at some point\nI don't know I really don't know but I have to be prepared for everything the book just came out I did the today show I've been just going through the the rounds and what's fascinating is so many of my colleagues in journalism the number one thing they asked me after they read the book is\nI just don't understand why you can't fix this thing but before we talk about any sort of policy of politics to get on the same page about what we're actually talking about right\nI Want to think that is in your diet for example if I just counted all the undocumented Asian undocumented block undocumented white people what do we want to do with them and the rule now is what do each community each county each state really wants to do with us so there's only twelve states that allow us to drive\nAnd I'm Sorry to say the Oregon it's no longer wanted them right so I I really don't know anymore what can happen in DC given how partisan and toxic it is what I Do know is every community has to decide who is welcome and how do they define American\nRight so our work is into that as a gay man I remember the time when Alan was on the cover of time when will and grace of number one talk show on television right before we actually passed same sex marriage as a law\nThe culture in which we talk about gay people had to change it is now thankfully culturally unacceptable to the anti gay in this country you say something on the immigrant not only did accept\nOne thing that somebody is listening to this interview right now out wherever they are in America who might want to try to change the way that we talk about there's no way we think about what's one thing somebody can do\nHas to start would you meaning how willing are you to be uncomfortable talking to you own relatives about this are you going to call your coworker out who says something bad about eagles\nRight leg at defining American we strongly believe in the gift of uncomfortable conversations that's mostly what the show is great but for me if you are not uncomfortable talking about this with someone else and you're actually not doing it right drink so\nGet comfortable with the discomfort of having real conversation about what happened is is right\nAnd that's why I think this book is going to really help because it's a clear deliberate two hundred page play by play of what it actually means to be this kind of abstract term I think in in the minds of a lot of people that live in this country it's this kind of blank place holder\nWord like immigration reform or illegal but now here's the story with a beginning\nMiddle and I hope a the kind of and that we all want for you that I think can can make that change\nWith a relative or a community or community member our school\nIf they could take a look at the book Oh thank you better hope but you know looks [laughter] I Love this country if I didn't I Would have already left I Love all the teachers that ever welcoming near I Love\nI Love that I'm from Mountain View California I Love that you know this is a country that always tries to figure out how to better itself um and I think we have to remind people that it actually a choice for us to stay right we choose to stay the question is what is your choice what are you gonna do Jose Antonio Vargas everyone\n[noise]\n\nAll right Jose [noise] we we couldn't let you leave quite yet we're talking this week on the show about fishing our fears and uh as you mentioned and as we were doing some research on you we learn that a fear that you have is going to therapy you apparently told NPR that you've never been to therapy before because you've always been a little bit scared of it because you watch Frasier as a kid\n[laughter] and so we were hoping that we could sort of help tackle your fear of\nIt's about both topics the segment we like to call let's get quiz the Gulf\nYou know [noise]\nHere's the veterans\nYou get a work 'cause uh we're going to give you a quote and you have to tell us if it's advice from the fictional Dr Frasier Crane or a real quote from an eminent therapist [laughter]\nOkay yeah sure\n[noise]\nIt may be an unwise man who doesn't learn from his own mistakes but it's an absolute idiots that doesn't learn from other people's\nHouse from the audience to\nWait is this something he would have been an episode\nOf these are either things that Dr Frasier Crane said during an episode of Frasier or it's something that was said\nBy an eminent psychotherapist but not Niles Crane [laughter]\nI feel comfortable asking you this because uh you ... you write about it can you take me back\nFacial weekend where the host of this show and I was scheduled to be a guest on this show yeah\nAnd you decided not today said [laughter]\n[laughter] right well and I didn't think I would've done hosting the show I just knew that I was having a massive today panic attack\nAnd that I couldn't do it and I mean I had I been hosting for nine years at that point and\nAnd I had never canceled a show um my wonderfully supportive brother\nI called him and he just kept saying you've got to cancel you have to cancel and I said oh there's all these people they're counting on me and and there's the whole staff and the audience and my brother is um he's a very straightforward person and he's a very kind person but\nAt the time it was just he looked at me he had to look on his face that said it is so adorable that you think you're that important\n[laughter]\nHe just looked at me and you know when people when someone tipped their head and looks at you and that's what he did he put a blender your heart takes a little\nBless your sweet little heart the world is not going to stop turning call your producer\nAnd what were the what was extraordinary about that moment as you well know was that you were going to be on the show the next day and the whole reason we were having you won with that you were this guy who was a podcast host and we thought you could fill in for me if I ever got sick and I honestly think that part of what happened\nWhen my brain going this is your chance this is your chance to get out of the situation\nThe things I eighty four for a number\nAnd it was an untenable situation and I called Robin ... is our producer at the time and I said\nAnd I called her with a problem in a solution and I said I Can't hosted let's ask loop to do it but what I didn't know that you weren't a massive bender that night\n[laughter] [noise]\nThe night before the show which meant that morning of the show I was massively hung over\nOf those things from like a like an old like Bob Hope movie\nThe person wakes up and they see three of everything [noise]\nOf those mornings and what I was looking at it was my cell phone and there was just a lot of missed calls from Portland\nYeah yeah you were Bob Hope drunk yeah um you know and I've I've been on book tour and I've been telling the story and what I always say to people was you hosted that night and I already written the whole script right like everything was done and you hosted that night and what I said to do what I say to people is\nSomething happened that was wonderful and horrible and that is that the show\nWas great and it was fine and Luke was fantastic and so I realized that this thing that I had helped him make could totally survive without me and that's great news and it's terrible news you know yeah\nYou know so I always thought that the show is the thing that made me maybe the only thing that may be interesting right because they didn't have a great self image and then this other thing is when everyone thinks you're really lucky it takes you a really long time to realize how miserable you are\nI'm Talking to Courtney ... writer extraordinary [noise]\n[noise] you describe\nYour personality is high and eroticism and blow in extra version which seems a like a bad fit for you or you know you've done up on stage of amazing singing voice you posted this show you're like how do you square those two parts of your personality\nIt's very difficult I mean I I struggle with neurotic them obviously but I also struggle with you know I started with a negative self image for a really long time and so when I realized with the audience for this thing that causes me so much anxiety but at the same time\nHearing their applause and their laughter was proof that I was an okay person you know and and I think that when I lost the hosting gig and I\nMe credit for them having a great time for three hours on a Saturday Night you know and somehow it was like that means that I'm worthy of something and you cannot get your self worth from four hundred drunk people\nThe terrible idea I'm going to do my damned us to see if I can make that [laughter] [noise] right [noise]\nSo you you you started writing this column and you started this really active process of of sort of taking on projects that were scary do you are pushed your comfort level or your boundaries 'em and you wrote about it and there's like adventures are kind of amazing when did you feel most out of your element in all these different things that you took on\nCuddling Polly Amory drugs you name it [laughter]\nI Would say I was most uncomfortable going to the professional Cutler my imagining that was\nBy far the most difficult thing for me I can you explain the professional color I mean it's sort of right there in the title yes but for folks that are familiar what what what ... what does this woman to address\nTheir name is Samantha has and she has a business called cuddle up to me and you pay a dollar a minute to cuddle her um she had a business out of her house for a long time but she was so successful that she opened up a storefront here in Portland\nAnd she is fifty six different positions that you can choose from but she really sort of as an impasse and kind of decides what you need\nAnd what it's like why would that one of the things that was really scary for you\nFor me I'm afraid to talk to strangers I don't like talking to strangers I never approach people in public um and so for me the idea of than cuddling with a stranger is far far worse but another reason it gave me a lot of trepidation was\nThat I saw the the the ocean of snark that came at her when she got a lot of media attention and I thought that people said things like that pathetic and you know are just terrible things about the people who needed her\nAnd the thing was I have been single the majority of my adult life and I had really like a decade where\nPeople weren't touching me and people who get touched on a regular basis they don't understand what it feels like\nTo knock it touched and what it does to your self image you start to believe that you don't deserve to be touched or loved and that feeling is so vulnerable and and so what gave me trepidation about it when I related to the people who needed her since ...\nThey put me as much as ... as I could have been when my entire body was a two by four you know like I Am so I turned into maybe a piece of ... cook spaghetti and so you know yeah but we titled for a while then she had me do these affirmation\nAnd wish I hate affirmation oh I hate them so much but but the one thing she made me to say you know I'm enough I'm amazing which I Know I Know it's new and I was fine with it I was like this is fine I Am enough right now uh I haven't paid my taxes for twenty twelve but that's not a big deal\nOut of the job of being the host of the show is ... [laughter]\nWhen I was like a been there\nAnd you know and I'm amazing and I'm like\nAmazing I did this number scared but then she got to I'm beautiful and I started crying and I realized oh that's the point of affirmation is to not necessarily point you to the things that you want to believe but point out the things that you know you don't believe by yourself because you can't say\nWe got to take a short break we're talking to Cornell ... her book is okay fine whatever the year I went from being afraid\nOf everything being afraid of most things this is why aren't the\nNext time I asked me another actor Diane Guerrero talked about her writing process and immigration activism\nI thought maybe my voice could be an asset um I Know what this feels like I Know what family separation is so I decided okay I'll race and thing in the news the needle in any way\nThe joy meals your eyes burn for NPR's our puzzles war games and trivia starting it too right here on the NPR News service of northwest public broadcasting\nIn a big thank you to everyone who supports northwest public broadcasting in a warm welcome to listeners became members with their first time donations on super Thursday\nNorthwest public broadcasting research program support from WFSU undergraduate education hosting authors Kelly and Zach winter Smith at the end you will come and reading invited lecture on Monday or cover twenty second seven PM and the cubs and your ballroom a couple of Wilson copies are there common reading book soon ish following the lecture which was open to the public\nWelcome back to live wire radio from PR I unload Burbank ... at the Alberta rose theater in Portland, Oregon [laughter]\nWe are talking about facing your fears this week and we have Courtney ... here writer\nWhatever the year I went from being afraid of everything to only being afraid of most things um do you think that you in in taking on all these challenges in pushing your your boundaries in front of your fears do you think that you've actually been able to sort of fundamentally change yourself as a person or how you move through the world", "show_name": "On the Media", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "14"}
