{"month": "10", "state": "WA", "station": "KWSU", "content": "Getting [noise]\nYou know I've been listening to lady on the\nRadio around WWE and why he [noise]\nAm jet up I'm Ron I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't [laughter] and uh in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode or contain some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no no no don't say that we have to say that we don't we ask you and so that tension exists throughout the show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we must but we've done is it is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with a you may wanna might wanna yeah\nAnyway the story comes to us from producers Simon after so let's start can we start in two thousand eight sure about what the song yes please check [laughter]\n\n\n\nSo ah December twenty seven a sunny Saturday morning or that this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of [laughter]\nBut the humble gathering of a a few dozen women and babies that right there are you there\nIs one of the organizers up the gathering Stephanie mirrors\nWhat are you calling for nursing\nNurse in has been like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would up one of those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise]\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that the small peaceful\nProtest would turn out to be this morning as faced off on faith fun one of\nThe opening shot Facebook triggered hordes now what would become a loud but do Facebook rockets\nGlobal\nBattle embattled state but today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the strings you recently heard about Russian interference in the election meddling or data breaches [noise] but but rather something that I think is a deeper than both of free speech [noise]\nViolence against roe kingdom what we can say and what we can't\nSay by twenty of what we can see and what we can see a black or white kids in front of me\nOn the Internet [noise]\n\nMr soccer America got to\nDo you object differently prioritize or sensors speech\n[noise] congresswoman or we don't [noise] Grover during a censoring speech but there are types\nWhat what really grabbed me was we're discovering that underneath all of this is an actual\nEight text document that dictates what I can say on\nFacebook digital document it's about fifty pages if you've printed off\nAnd diet in bullet points and it's been statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow which made me wonder like what are these rules\nHow were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really put it to the test so ah let's start back on that morning two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all [laughter]\nYou know building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room\nTrying to figure out what to do I'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch to just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nAnd now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook in place\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this isn't nearly two\nThousand scientists change this week in the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path my space time is now than a website in the U.S\nFacebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table\nEach of them in front of their own computer and things that come up onto their ... to Facebook\nAnd I'm like meaning like I use or something that I thought was wrong exactly like our reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards this cake chronic she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing\nAnd and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content\nAnd then [noise] that content along with an alert\nWould would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen most of what you were saying with either\nNaked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason why someone had report it because it was like a photo of uh\nThat computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it down and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your ... leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do with this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't know when you Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind it was\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that as one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry that that the guidelines were really one page long there are wondering how long and basically all just page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until [laughter]\nRise up fight for the rights that\nBreath anyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on a Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie mirrored those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough through Facebook\nSo to coincide with the life protest they just jumped typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status to\nThe title of our group a face breath leading it's not a team [noise] and it caught on social networking Web site and under fire for any policy on some women threatened leading their children to twelve thousand members participated and the media frequent started pouring in\nA bad thing is I did hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington Post interesting Dr phil\n[noise] it was a media storm and eventually perhaps as a result of our group in our effort Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules\nFor example by the end nudity was already not a lot on the site but they\nAt the time they they realized they had to start spelling out exactly what they meant\n... all of these people at Facebook were in charge of trying to define nudity\nSo I mean yeah the first cut out it was visible male and female genitalia and then visible female breast and then the question is well okay how much of a breast needs to be showing before it's Newt and the thing that we landed on was if you could see essentially the nipple and Ariel law than that's nudity\nFound out pretty quickly none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nThere's a lot of renting infamy happening\nDo you work in I mean like we just came out of there I Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like an ...\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk to me do you want to be named her you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that that's the only find you know I just go and victory I don't want to move up here\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to ah admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAttract prohibit any ... about ...\nMind there's several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worth of that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want\nTo I I signed up to monitor traffic I much\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you guys are so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year can jump to his desk every morning put on his head phones I\nLike I like big nor ... plenty\nCatch a case by case by case forty five ... every day it was just at lunch at a special image to\nFight five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case he\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every\nThree or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\n... ... if I can ... what kind of things did you see\nThe last ... I ... a ... to ... to extradite a\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nHad to explain to you know get squashed by attached to you know people ... like\n[noise] ...\nYear old girl I was having sex with an eight year old boy at that just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you did did it\nHe got himself thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nThat they were very specific like it is but I couldn't watch it was while I think it's ... ... S C I F heads were exploding like I have to walk away\nAnd I just I had to I I it's just it's too real [noise] I I saw that [noise]\nAh it's it's classic adjusted the\nDifferent moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nYou see all of the stuff\nThat you and I don't have to see because they are going around playing cleanup yeah what a job well yeah and and it's worth noting that are more and more just work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a Gore or terrorist propaganda\nOr that they're getting better automate that but yeah the uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks\nOf of other terrorists video or other gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nBut a moving on to our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on\nAnd that surrounding hate speech\nOh good moral that's coming out of there will be laughter really there will be comedians there will be joked comedians hey All right okay so

speech and we just want her mind you guys are they're just you're just tuning in ... episode contains graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we do warn you that you you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing to do with their kids in the room to set it up yeah okay back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook you're trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are Steyer and consistent and I would argue that there's balancing act was put to the test April Fifteen to twenty Thirteen strike\nAnd Carlin Rhonda ... sorry but my aunt had to make it up thank you I mean how can break we have some breaking news uh otherwise they wouldn't cut you off to abruptly Carlos\nMonday to Fifteen to twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure cooker bombs [noise]\nThrough the crowd near the finish line Boston there [noise]\nAnd you ask for it to begin to federal\nPeople are bringing into action\nOr just one man in a cowboy hat sees a spectator who who's been injured fix him I'll throw them in a wheelchair\nAnd they're pushing him through the the sort of ash cloud that there's a photographer there any snapped loose [noise]\nThe photos show the runner and the cowboy hat and these two other people pushing this man who uh is faced with action from all the debris and one of his legs is completely blown off\nAnd the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then sort of skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific\nFacebook employees are clustering around several deaths staring at the computer screens watching the news bring\nThis has occurred just in the last half\nHour or so I have memories of of watching some of the coverage chilling new images just released on the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo\nPublished on line and it wasn't long after that\nSomeone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the order sense here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly started going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it just images reading like wildfire across their platform is it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to their rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone and so by the rules to start or should obviously come down yep\nHowever have to ... says\nNo the other people are saying this is news worthy\nEssentially just photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which the media the receipts push back\nWell I was saying that what we pride ourselves on with not making those calls and\nThere are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvement\nWe made the guidelines for a moment like this ... the other side shoots back\nOh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines much have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down\nBut before they can pull the lever word starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... sent down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n\nDon't care what your guidelines say I don't care what you ...\nUm yeah that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher but they don't see maybe they have but it's a major news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah ... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like if Facebook is sort of collective scrap\nBook for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want\nOr yeah it is it now in news organization strength parents\nHere let me let me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nIn this question has been popping up a lot recently infected even came up this past April when soccer burglars testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher center\nAnd this is a\nView us as a tech company I guess the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you're responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right [noise] well I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that's incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built\nProducts basically soccer brick and others that the company arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where are they can't be held liable for much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what ... what really strikes me about all this is if you're you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound than white people find interesting more important what what people find newsworthy ... they'll give and I'll give you a you know give you a great example of this\nOr that having just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico and it's uh\nCamera and then a man with his face covered grabs her head pulled her head back and slices her head off right in front of the camera and this video starts being spread\nI Can't

... turkey says it is continuing its investigation into the killing\nYesterday the Saudi Government abandoned it earlier claim that it had no idea what happened to ... he was last seen after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month\nTurkish investigators said he was killed inside the cocktail it at that his body was mutilated the new Saudi version of events as a journalist was killed after a fight broke out between him an unnamed people inside the consulate\nNPR's Peter Kenyon has more from it simple\nThe Saturday acknowledgement ... died inside the consulate did little to satisfy critics who say the kingdom is still trying to deflect blame away from crown prince Mohammed bin Salman they note that the Saudis took more than two weeks to confirm what Turkish investigators have been saying all along and didn't allow authorities to search diplomatic buildings for ten days\nOfficials have also said the theory that a brawl broke out doesn't fit with the evidence that the Saudi forensics expert was sent to assemble the same day 'cause showed you arrived at the consulate\nIncredible he also said the fight and accidental death is just a theory that's being thrown out and he doesn't want to use arms sales to the Saudis as retribution\nFor a hundred and fifty million dollars a hundred and ten million of which is military order for this is equipment

Arabia is when it comes to suppressing dissent suppressing a media criticism so first of all is it fair to assume that the details that we've been getting so far from the Turkish media and other

now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me no I I have to ask do you think that race with a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this\nIt absolutely was I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother as it takes three three hundred and thirty pounds and it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think it has been shown that some offices\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to arrest him without harming him um it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrest from black men in particular versus arrest for white men that they clear racial disparity\nYou you know to do that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds of those ... those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were describing someone wouldn't you described those things you\nMight not have sampled do you know how tall Dylann Roof is do you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people that are there and so as these rare to have it as intimidating and particularly threatening\nIt's been reported that your brother struggled with some mental health issues with that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because believe people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that his mental health issues or a factor in that as well\nAnd I think here you see the impact of intersection nowadays though he is at the intersection of being a person of color black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show academy between police and people with mental illness\nSo I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who is clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is jak committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to before is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where ... privilege and power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected um to issue the poverty that aren't as connected as she does mental health in certain areas and connected cars race\nIn terms of how people reacted I haven't been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result as colleagues at Facebook who thought there was an important story and who um shouted veterans who story they wanted to be told\nThat about a a Kobe she's the sister of ... uh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the semi tail county sheriff's deputy she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she took it for her home and of course amplifying ... is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone a Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nLead you know I don't like that like [noise]\nWhy are you hearing\nThe\nVoice West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with mark ... how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we have an old ... edition of African Americans are materials\nStopped and I guess Philando Castile is kind of tipping iceberg for me\nIt's still end up the hill is an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nYes and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to\nAt least to find the behavior expectations of citizens and police officers and what's lost here\nIs that people thinking the legislation Jess focus on citizens will it doesn't it doesn't just focus on our video a video camera sets the stage for additional course content for both the citizen and also pollution police academies\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy\nWhat we've done is to find the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that the length of course is a minimum of two hours the video is just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students the tickets to appear to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose\nOf the video is as a primary you know if we need to go back and makes it makes it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we the fire behavior expectations police officers and citizens and the citizens know what their rights\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and picket who was cast in it you'll get fat I guess\nWhat I mean why is that irrelevant when this very issue that use that spark your concern here is an African American man and I can encounter with a person that looked like him if that's the source of the tense and why would you\nMeasure let me ask this question you can pick out and that's fine because anything that I Do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on it I Will but the objective\nWas to find a mechanism by which we could have ... behavior content\nFor everyone and I thought getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put their behavior expectations of citizens and make certain citizens\nKnow what their rights on I thought put that in schools and making the mandatory was a great place to put it also also driver's license courses and also the police department of policing\nWill ultimately save lives\nWell but the question I think some people might have is the question the conduct of the drivers or is the question the unconscious bias of the officers\nOthers combination of both how do we make certain that there is content that deals with that biased piece\nHow do we make certain that and police departments that they have psychological examinations that Fred out that um conscience bias or an edge to just try to erase as best possible the buyers I'd like to say that this is going to be the parents here because it's not it's not\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI'm Janine hurts with these headlines President Trump today

G.\nFrom battle a language apps that teaches real life conversations in a new language including Spanish French and German battles ten to Fifteen minute lessons are available in the app store or online at babble B a B B. E. L. dot com\nAnd from the listeners to support this NPR station [noise]\nIs all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin\nWe want to turn now to the conservative effort to remake the federal courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd while you've probably heard about the federal societies role and during that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC this week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group\nTargeting recent law school graduate who had secured clerk ships for federal judges\nIn exchange for participation and they all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the trainings\nThis week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now Adam thanks so much for joining us it's going to be here so what what the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut she spoke with some legal scholars who said that this raised ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong\nWith a seminar they may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar but there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learn secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic about having to make a promise\nThat whatever they learn will be used for and I'm going to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts are kind of indoctrination a law clerk is an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties on to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nThat it's a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice to\nThat yeah that that that's exactly right so it it's probably an affirmative good thing for law clerks than others\nTo learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction but not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nAll kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create pipelines fraternities sororities they all kind of create\nPipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at this they'd been particularly intentional at best\nThis represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench and heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy worth the fancy law schools the professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal\nSo they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far\nIn trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably fine but also to make the make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is\nNot fine and what does heritage say about this I Do know that when your piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually spending that program what else did they say\nThey have been very close mouthed about it I tried them repeatedly before and after\nThe article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see who is paying for it you know their materials said a generous donors were make news significant financial investment of each and every attendee they wouldn't say who the donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where\nAnd when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February they just issued a brief bland statement saying they were reevaluating it\nWhich suggests that perhaps they may try to reconstituted in a different form it's entirely possible is that um attack he covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be here\nFinally today we're going to head into the barbershop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their mind today we want to talk about how Hollywood is putting the opioid crisis front and center in London or button you shout\nLet me just say that we realize that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with it every day cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premiere episode of the Roseanne report this week and you might remember the ABC canceled the ... of the popular Ninety show\nAfter star Roseanne Barr tweeted racist comments and then the network decided to try a spin off called the Connors which mere at this week and ... we learned that spoiler alert the rows and character die by way of an opioid overdose\nAttack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery then it was just I'd be pro it's got to be wrong\nWe when I could talk about it so we called Sam ... he's the author of dreamland the true tale of America's opiate epidemic and he's joining us from Los Angeles via Skype Sam thanks so much for joining us\nPleasure to be here myself think you also joining us from NPR West in Culver City California is Jeff Yang he's a CNN contributor and columnist for the wall Street Journal online chef will come back to you as well always welcome to evacuate and we're going to start with you because critics had very different reactions some people thought it was very well done some people thought it avoided some of the kind of tough\nSocial commentary that made Roseanne Roseanne how did you see it\nYou know it's really interesting because anytime\nA sitcom has to actually address issues that are frankly a black can and dark and a\nLooming in a lot of waste in our society there's a tension between the comedy aspect of it and the the harshest the real world circumstances or that provide the inside right and in this case one of the things that was really strange to me is that\nOne of the excuses Roseanne gave when she did that sort of racist tweet that got her fired\nWas that she was on Ambien at the time that that you know medication and potentially lead to this behavioral change so there's a we're tension in some ways uh in in terms of what's on the screen and the reality of her behavior Medicaid or not in the real world is our culture guy though what did you think of the episode just as briefly as yeah\nI I you know it was it was actually I thought really fascinating I thought they did a really good job of a touching on the ways that people use humor sometimes to push back against the darkness and the presence of the absence of Roseanne was was powerful so uh I I thought they did a pretty good job actually addressing a very difficult\nTopic [laughter] I said I Know you're not a critic but you're deeply immersed in covering this crisis okay and I just wondered if you felt about it as a person who knows a lot about the reality of the situation [noise]", "show_name": "Live from Here", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day":
