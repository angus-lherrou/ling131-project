try\nThis one a Robert Krulwich and our producers Owen we'll or talk to writer Adam Gopnik about George Carlin twice George Carlin mentioned\nOh because Carl and it's a wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language you don't have the comedians of media\nThat guy is about the English language about little expressions we use we we all stay in the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time is one of his great subject I don't really seem to examine these expressions\nAnd all the more interesting because he was he didn't even have a high school education you know so it was not something that he got from like schooling and one of\nGOP next favorite curling versus I really like this one to just about how Carlin hated euphemism\nDon't like words that high the truth I don't like where's the conceal reality I don't like euphemisms an American English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality as Karlan was wonderful about things like that was about both the call and we have no\nAnd he was on so that that's the reason we use you fish and I just been through my father in law died four months ago and we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in\nIntensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught we just went your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely I mean she's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs to the hill\nPass out before he died and so\nAnd so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to decide something that you cannot disguise Carlin's real point was that it it like does\nOur reactions to it that actually has like a cabin negative fat and it gets worse with every generation has a whole bet it's about um shell shocked becoming PATS the you know he goes so goes it's in four different things\nIn the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shocked simple ... direct language to sell those shell shocked and then it became battles

to age levels now then it became post traumatic stress disorder [noise] still a syllabus but we've added a hyphen and then it became peachy as post traumatic stress disorder that pain is completely buried under jargon\nThis was Orwell notion that you could erase sensitivities if you bland it out the words so if you stop saying oh yeah we just tortured the guy if you say some\nFreedom interrogation or enhanced interrogation that makes a big difference in part of a ... saying it's like now that his pie TST we're not having the appropriate reaction to it I mean its\nShell shock I'll bet ya if we'd have still been calling a shell shocked some of those Vietnam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at the time\nEspecially at a town where the streets are a lot

V. and gee that's it\nBut he is the problem see like we humans were more than DNA we are these flashy teen piles of muscle and bone and all of that stuff all the stuff stuff of us comes from proceeding yeah\nWe have like a hundred thousand different proteins and our body different kinds of pertains to the question was like how how does all that get generated\nLike how did this for simple base has become the amino acids to become the hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us us\nHow do you make the transition people were thinking of this as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved and the first person who really think seriously\nAbout this was not a geneticist cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't that complicated this is just ... graffiti [noise] this is a code problem [noise]\n... thought okay I Know the DNA can hands for bases ATC and GE and ... days somehow create hundreds of thousands of protein so I just need to think\nOf a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA\nThe ACC Gigi ... go ahead [noise] [noise] how come the protein what\nWhat's simple toad could I Do to do that and just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out two sides I think that ourselves read our genes three bases at a time\nG. T. C. H. A. C. A. G. E. T.\nIn other words whatever it was it was reading the DNA and sell maybe it was reading it in triples not hair because if you had three or rather than to get my fingers lagging mathematically would give me more possibilities\nAnd that might put you on a path making all those hundreds\nOf thousands of protein get now this was just a guess but shortly after the double helix duo Watson and Crick\nAnd a group of other scientists worked it all out they they figured out how you get from\nPhysically get from DNA into proteins here's how it works and sort of inside the cell the DNA is sitting\nThere ... it was a set of molecules come along attached to it and zip it and I feel\nThis copies now made of ... which is like DNA very similar still in the basic sort of four letter format\n\nPresident Trump is hoping for warmer ties with an uneasy ally after North Carolina pastor Andrew Brunson was freed from prison\nWe feel much different about turkey today than we did yesterday\nFor Saturday October Thirteen this is all things considered [noise]\nI'm Shereen Marisol Meraji will get the latest from the White House and get more on a mysterious case of a missing Saudi journalist [noise]\nThere are in a really tough position if they can explain what happened to him\n[noise] plus we'll meet their Jones who takes on Nineteen character and one big theme in her one woman show I'm On a continuum\nOf women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture that's all coming up first means\nLive from NPR News in Culver City California I'm Janine Herb's the clean up from hurricane Michael continues across several states at least fourteen people have died but rescuers haven't reached some of the hardest hit areas if you're a school Lawrence is in Mexico Beach Florida\nOh doctors are buzzing overhead and you can hear the chirping of fire alarms inside homes or their running low on battery power here for several days [noise] from how did you see are scanning three four stories high and right next to the [noise]\nCinder block [noise] sort of outline where they're used to be a house rescue squad\nThey're starting a more extensive search of houses now that they were just giving a quick three hours to before and there are fears that the death toll could rise Quil Lawrence NPR News Mexico Beach Florida\nPresident Trump says he plans to coat Saudi king Solomon over the next twenty four hours to discuss the disappearance unlikely doubt the Washington Post journalist ... he was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nAnd as NPR's Tamara Keith reports that's complicating the U.S Saudi relationship talking to reporters at the White House President Trump acknowledged that it doesn't\nInformation and that's why he hasn't yet called the Saudi king to discuss it\nWe do know nobody knows right now the answer we're looking for the\nTurkish authorities say they have audio and video evidence that shaggy was tortured and murdered Trump says if ... has been killed in Saudi Arabia is proven responsible then there will be severe punishment\nAsk what that punishment should be Trump said there are many options but he doesn't want to stop sales of military equipment to the kingdom camera Keyes NPR News\nAnd President Trump is campaigning for Republican candidates in Richmond, Kentucky tonight a rally is scheduled to start at this hour Facebook has released more details about a recent security breach that exposed personal details of millions of users and ... she has more\nIn the last two weeks of September attackers exploited three bugs and Facebook's code to gain access to users accounts they didn't get any passwords but they didn't have to they were able to act just like they were logged in\nFacebook now says thirty million people had their accounts accessed about house had their name and email or phone number taken but for fourteen million the attackers view more including their gender religion birthday recent location check ins and search history [noise]\nFour hundred thousand people had their post their groups and lists of friends access to Facebook wouldn't discuss who carried out the attack or why citing an active FBI investigation Camille dominance ...

we're going to start the program today at the White House where President Trump welcome to American pastor Andrew Brunson\nFriends and had been detained in Turkey for two years for months President Trump and others in his administration has been working on his release today pastor Brunson arrived in the U.S and appeared in the oval office with President Trump\nI just want to congratulate you because you of galvanizes groceries\nAnd to talk more about how has released came about and what this means for the U.S turkey relationship we're joined now by NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith hate him hey can you start by describing the scene in the oval office this afternoon\nSo you had President Trump seated in the middle next to him a was a pastor Brunson and his family on the other side there were senators and members of Congress and secretary of state Mike Pompeo\nWant it to pray for President Trump and he got down on his knees late his hands on the president and prayed that that President Trump be given supernatural wisdom well what led up to this whole moment yet so pastor Brunson was arrested more than two years ago as part of a round up following a coup attempt on Turkish president\nRegimen type air to one uh he had been accused of espionage and aiding terrorists which the pastor denies to this day of course um there was a lot of lobbying from President Trump from all those members of Congress the state department and especially vice president Mike Pence worked a lot on this case\nUm Brunson was moved in July to house arrest\nThen that wasn't enough President Trump was not happy about it and in August he imposed sanctions on turkey to try to force the release a Bronx and um that released came on friday\nA and he arrived at joint base Andrews earlier today\nDoes this mean anything for the relationship between the U.S and turkey\nYou know these are two countries that are part of NATO I'm there has seemed to be a pretty good report between President Trump and president air to one uh though Trump set it on a number of occasions that this situation with pastor Brunson was hurting their relationship I'm\nIn the oval office today and also on Twitter President Trump insisted that there was no deal involved here uh in securing Brunson released a but he did say that it would likely improve the relationship between the two nations you know this comes at a time when the U.S and turkey\nAre trying to figure out how to navigate the disappearance and suspected murder of journalists drum all cause show ...\nUm he wrote for the Washington Post and was last seen walking into the Saudi consulate in as stumble up almost two weeks ago\nAnd we're going to talk more about that later in the program but first what are the domestic political implications of the Brunson released pastor Brunson\nCase was really important to evangelical Christians who took a keen interest in securing his released\nA and even jealous goals are a key part of President Trump's base and one other thing about this that stands out is that President Trump has really put a priority on freeing Americans who are held overseas it's an aspect of international relations that he's put a real emphasis on\n[noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from log men makers of go to meeting a collaboration meeting platform that comes equipped with teachers

headlines in a tight race for governor and Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp engine running against Stacey Abrams a Democrat who if elected could become the state's first black female governor\nActivists they're assuming can't because about fifty three thousand voter registration applications has been put on hold the majority of those applications belong to a black residents\nWe wanted to learn more about this that we call that my ... he's the government reporter for the Atlanta Journal constitution Mike welcome to the program thanks for having me All right so why were these voter applications put on hold\nGeorgia passed a law last year that's known as the exact match law and if your name or voter registration information doesn't exactly match or pretty closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays these potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia where did this come from it was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years to\nUm put voters on pending lists until they could be ... fully registered and then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously\nOver this law that resulted in a settlement in February of last year\nAnd very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into a state law and so now we're in round two where these civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp\nAgain but this time they're suing over something that's already passed into state law\nNow the secretary of state's office\nSays other states have this kind of law including Florida\nAnd in Florida and he weighs federal court upheld their law\nAnd activists are saying that dislike disproportionately affecting minority voters how have they made that case deal\nWell it is true um if you look at the list of he's fifty three thousand pending voters Seventy percent of them are African American if you add in other minority groups in particular routine does and Asians you get up to about eighty percent minorities that are pending\nDoes he have a history of getting involved with this kind of issue\nIt depends which side you talk to be\nHis opponents say that Brian ... is\nPart of this process that secretary of state who's in charge of elections and we have seen precincts close we have seen that there are these voters on pending wrist and\nWe have seen Georgia

[noise]\nWhat are you about Twenty years old age the use of my God are they go candies in my purse [laughter]\nAnd Sarah Jones with me in Studio welcome to the program\nThank you for having me and us I mean\nI Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify\nMost with all of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a ... there are a couple of ... types in here there are you know there's a a man who's objectify women with a former cop\nWho admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he says never on the clock though you know never went while I'm actually on the clock but yeah\nAnd you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different conversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worth in value are determined by my parents and my marketability\nI'm kind of engaging in one form of this same narrative so ... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOne of the things I'm discovering and performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in Kew NA or with social media\nAnd I found myself being really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about stripping as kind of a you know the sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have ... ...\nMore college where you have to you know kind of ... to burn more but who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and being a woman in a context that was\nObviously just as Texas as the rest of the culture but in hip hop and there was definitely this space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that\nI'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show to talk about these characters that human body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself and not person or whether they say to you\nMaybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent\n... can you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nI Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accent then you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman and the show\nShe's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people understand that I have a direct connection to them and the republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with her accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself\nBecause actually there's no indignity to having accent that English actually just means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love kind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so in the show and us how to do and went to the United nations schools you also comes from a mixed called her background so she was growing up with different people from different places from for so long but then when she came to India she was kind of walking out some of this material\nOn during the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex walk or prostitution ... sexual expectation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and he said but a good ... good job\nOr she is a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit so you know I really try to set my material with people from those community\nDoing this I'll say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nYeah well I think like so many of us in today's culture\nI come from a mixed upbringing experience my family was black and white I'm On my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a my character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interfaith guilt [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives the peoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of a pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like what what is it which is that you talk white you busy that I heard a lot of that\nAnd gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am\n[noise] that's Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah thanks so much\nThank you ... oh my pleasure our pressure\nAnd finally today we're going to take a listen to a pod cast I host along with Gene Demby called codes which is all about race and identity in America\nAnd in our most recent episode we talked about adoption specifically trans racial adoption\nMost adoptive parents in the U.S are white and a lot of them are adopting children who aren't as according to the Institute on family studies so we put out a call to those of you who are adopted we wanted to know how did adoption form your sense of racial identity and your sense of self and here's what she told us\nI spent the first of all the years in my life thinking that I was a little white girl and\nWhen I found out that it wasn't it wasn't just revelation it was an identity crisis\nSo really I think it's kind of a lack of identity that ties transnational adoptees together\nThe narrative about my adoption was released\nForeign by the white family I grew up with you told us you feel alone and want to know if there are other people like you out there\nYou asked us if you were a bunch of polls are those are yours and ours by trying to claim identity use that you weren't exposed to when you were growing up", "show_name": "Live from Here",
