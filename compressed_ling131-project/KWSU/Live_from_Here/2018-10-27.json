N. Y. [noise]\nThree two on hey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have any legal case well it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away it it gets under your skin this is Lisa where am I Am a law professor at Catholic university\nAt the Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna pharaoh who brought us this story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten\nYeah it it just made me\nNot knowing their to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSearching Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist one newspaper guy for the post aren't going to fall he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand and he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in a ... which is where the story begins\nThree men in a woman's go camping in the Adirondack pulled off the road a aside road off route thirty they made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two tenths and went to sleep for the night\nAnd then Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM to campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they signed up for this middle aged man peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer he had a door with a feather on a sun glasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he get the\nOther campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing a semi circle\nAnd then the mayor Ed Koch the gun and said listen or\nKilled before and I'll kill again [noise]\nUm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the what took him into the woods near a brook impair the two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of there which he pulled out some real\nBasically he had he had each them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied [noise] so after we had the four people tied he went back\nTo the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip dumb blue ski because the other three kids are spread out through the forest [noise] they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise]\nThen they heard filled with boys get really\nHigh and they knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nWhat was happening with having done whiskey and stuck and I have been times\nWhen this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman he took\nThe boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a\nDitch next to him to kind of monitor the situation I guess so Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter than our men come men that the other campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert locals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted done a killer and treatment\nLaying down in the debts and when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun just kind of stood up\nThe largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning in about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost is far up the road is you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in the state police standing by\nIt was the scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down our manpower into a moving for trolls men\nArmed with with all kinds of weapons rifle shotgun bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods say intentionally signed the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and that comes back with an ID the thirty seven year old Robert\nGary Rhoades Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward today she was an ex convict them in prison for rape seven years now armed with a thirty thirty\nRifle and nice and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday how do you feel at night when people got panic when you're all ah well one of the doors are short people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast I don't care that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left barbecue smoldering they left\nBehind coolers starts the guy down what happened was Guerra was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police following the lead and then he'd stolen car and hit that cited and me they're kind of closing in on it\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest summer\nThat day a conservation officer St ... blonde spotted\nGal [noise] three or ... something that aspect and scare started running\nThe black fire four times got him in the back the arm in the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they slog arrow and\nHe was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but\nThey took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\nThey\nPut 'em in an ambulance and they're rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him in the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional neither and for a girl\nThat the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case law professor lethal urban again is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording told the guy at the center of the conflict was a man named Frank our money frankly age aren't many brand I said a lawyer in Syracuse can never know how to pronounce her or money or urban that Mary Armani Frank's wife\nAnd are solid they use urban but it is er money\nA couple of months ago producers time an ad when I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York is our money's now in his eighties he's retired [noise]\nMy name is Frank our money and I was the attorney for Robert girl\nUm where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well we're just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go fight like standing up for the little guy and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defendants you're fighting the state and terrorists\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation but then he met Robert De Niro\nYeah bless your strong to take him out you need a forty five and a or to head the fear I mean this guy is dangerous and a lot of things are going to happen\nThis year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things wind won\nA schoolteacher headed south due to the child he sued the school and I talk to him out of it and then head on all of them will be represented but\nThen pretty quickly it gets dark Gareth charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then it got picked up for a blessing some you know encourage kids to very young girls age ...\nWe pick up where we left off the murder the manhunt and an August ninth than they ever got captured Frank gets a call from Garrett was\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nMay be as far as we can walk\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren a chemistry and Tom supervisor of Mariah at times because of that so that the road that goes to the miners are what do you have to their minds [noise] it was that sort of hilly area off the side of the road this a\nTrail of her own or you're just\nVery likely that day this hair issues to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills fairly feet never know leave and all the trees were black and I'm clarity skeletal I'm walking\nRight in the same area that are mania and this is the only way they could've came around here so\nHere we are in our Sunday suits recounts tragedy choose for is looking for\n[noise] expense and other powers looking [noise]\nWe found this when Arafat you see the air shaft there they\nFind this air shop to the gym with just a whole underground in a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the dumps into my office he carefully and just as good and he said yeah we don't want to slide down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank Armani lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft got a flashlight that he takes out and then do to help my feet and left the dominant in there and as Frank got lower down into the whole\nI could see here's\nThe shoe simply sneaker [noise]\nAnd and and like I said to myself this is a good does it\nEnd he yelled back up to ... get me outta here [noise] my backup\nDoes\nActually Dell gee found the other body ... she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her but our money wasn't there when the algae founder so what ensued was a very long struggle where the lawyers tried to figure out what\nOut what what are your options\nShirt so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor these are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we took her to know to keep the confidence is over wire under the current\nRules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality ... so you're not supposed to tell anybody except to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that as yet that can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up and even if they have hired\nDetectives and even if the local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there is no if if if people are already dead then you build the law in his\nShoe that's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role\nIn that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role in is to to play the part of the system in which you're the one\nWho stands up to the guy that everybody else hate even if everybody hates you even if maybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fight as hard as they can for the client\nThe lawyer is the agent of his client\nOnly only the agent or also citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double merger here and families seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens fray as to what each year building on on the side of tell just tell\nTale of course yes and I knew Mr hawk from blowing

P. P. dot org however over the radio tab then click schedule [noise]\nRadiolab continues snacks [noise]\n\nOkay hey I'm ... I'm I'm Roger I'm rubber ... which is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral\nSo you're surfing they found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what what's their next move wild so they decided to pre bird plea bargain to take this information to the prosecutor and say I have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes\nAnd in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my client to get ... into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give them a little and you're going to trigger\nWell that's kind of gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargain then that's a way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client\nSo report Jim Tracy again they called a meeting with Andrew McCabe investigator from the state police the duct tape and the district attorney armies office and when they met army ... search the briefcase was up to be a an investigator make sure they weren't wearing bug\nBecause they're paranoid there's going to be a wiretap or some sort of bug and then a Belgian presents the deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies\nI Want you to agree to put my client in a mental institution instead of sending them off the president and the prosecutor apparently very quickly put two and two together and immediately thought\nOh are you talking about Susan ... like these are the two girls that we're most concerned about we think they're alive\nAtticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association conference on professional responsibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them layers and they were there to watch on stage a featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that [noise] I don't think\nI Would hear or just was a lawyer the director's job [noise]\nUh [noise] I was a good lawyer [noise]\nSo I thought so art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and Dell gee did a good body is case\nTaught in law school across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what if people think what if what if what if people say so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand\nUp I agree um his duties to his client in our presents his client's best interest if you've been in the city\nBecause president can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what the lawyer she should be\n\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me\nBut eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan mother\nSusan was a girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend and she's who our money and don't you found in the mind you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it's that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught us the right way to do things and ethical class is totally and comprehensible company\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes\nIt was yes you are the only in talking to you that I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend\nBut what about the victim and I think that that should at least be an equal starting their mind if not a greater consideration\nThis was happening\nYes in only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing\nWe flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh when we were there sitting with the police men they received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call\nThat Danny's my daughter's boyfriend\nWhat his body was found and that's that's all we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just\nGetting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact I\nEven went so far as to contact a psychic fats how how important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli a lawyer\nMaybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of of horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway\nTo try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approached this it's with a lot\nOf sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain the I think the instinct to side with the family than to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate some of that experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I mean forty years later I'm Still I I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because it'll never go away as long as I live so\nI guess\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of 'em that stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan\nWell\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree has too much weight I we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University too difficult for us\nAnd Danny what's your boyfriend had best jets that summer and he had a full scholarship to her and he graduated just before so too and I'm sure the other two children had great future I had a very true\nAnd it's just horrible tragedy\n\n\nIt's a horrible to be in the position\n[noise] I mean how how do you relate losing your daughter you know [noise] what what excuses to protecting the person that killed her\nNo justification you couldn't just apply in my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it\nBut that's the way it is\n\n\n\n\nUm I'm going to get just a minute of silence I hear you [noise]\n\n\nCan you hear that\n[noise] water I think it's\nFrom deeper down in their ... and I

of the FBI and but besides that we don't know a whole lot about him\nCan you tell us any more about what type of weapon or weapons were used and how long it took to subdue him\nSure so at the scene there were three handguns and one of salt rifle recovered or\nOfficials said they they weren't sure if all of those were used in the shooting but they they were recovered at the scene and the whole uh the whole situation in to have lasted about twenty minutes\nOr hours entered the synagogue and uh that is where are the the shooting happened and then a officials say he walked out of the synagogue and was engaged by a police officer and uh there is a bit of a a ... a shooting exchanged there and then ... hours went back into the synagogue and they eventually recovered him\nAnd and before we conclude here can you tell us whether there were any security guards posted on the reason I mentioned that as a President Trump rejected the notion that this had anything to do with gun laws he said

following the shooting at the synagogue and Pittsburgh today we will have more later in the program but first let me tell you why we're in Philadelphia you may have hurt other colleagues from NPR on the road this week like this\nStates and counties we decided to come here because Pennsylvania the Keystone State went for President Trump and two thousand sixteen breaking a winning streak for Democrats that stretch back to Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Pennsylvania was supposed to be part of that and blue wall from Pennsylvania to Michigan to Wisconsin the Democrats thought with secure the White House for them and all of the states went for Trump on election night\nNow the Democrats are banking on a comeback here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house because we've been talking with candidates business owners students working folk people we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not\nAnd we've been asking all of them what's on what's on their minds this election year had help us understand what we've been hearing we asked WHYY Dave Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and thank you so much for hosting us and\nThanks to all the people who offered a pumpkin bread and cookie insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is great to have you all so nationally Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and Allen said I could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the politics of the state mean for the last six years Pennsylvania have had congressional maps that were pretty bizarrely shape and generally acknowledged to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats and Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis will challenge last year and a lawsuit that was aimed not a federal court where some of these gerrymandering suits have stalled but at the state court\nAnd in Pennsylvania the state Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map and unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion as controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre they're big theme is playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist or do you see that\nSure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can't say that naming off who will ...\nIf you have done or said anything controversial it will be exaggerated an amplified on television and hopes to to undermine you well\nOne of the reasons that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it had to attract an enormous amount of national attention it's drawn huge amounts of money it's been one of the most expensive campaign and the country and a lot of that has to do\nWith the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton it two thousand sixteen but what's also carried by a Republican congressman at this case Brian Fitzpatrick\nHe's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists named Scott while I was never run for office before and he's poured millions of dollars up his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nBecause it's an extraordinary you're not just the policies that are being twisted around and and turned toward the one percent on the corporations\nAnd away from the Ninety nine percent but just a moral tone of our country I've got three kids or to raise a kid in this atmosphere this influence coming from the White House\nIt's destructive of the fabric of our moral core in America and destructive of democracy the assault on the media the assault on the courts on the rule of law and the FBI our intelligence agencies on the very notion of truth itself\nIs under assault and I've never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen do you think the campaign here hinge upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and all very negative [laughter] so what do you think is the lynchpin of it here\nThe on a specific level the big issues here our health care and clean air and clean water we have local issues with water pollution from a military base and air pollution but the overarching issue\nThat ties all of us together is money in politics my opponent has taken a million dollars in corporate tax money I refused to take a dime\nHe's got seven and a half million dollars in superPAC contributions a huge amount of corporate money in this\nAnd I think people are fed up with that because that's what is blocking the people's business from getting done and you think people are noticing that when I explain this is why you're not getting clean air and clean water when you want reform of Wall Street predatory lending\nWhen you want gun control the amount of money that flows in from the big corporate special interests stops every single thing that the people want you know frankly the situation with money in politics is outrageous\nPhiladelphia is ridiculous nobody can raise Fifteen million dollars without going to the corporations and begging them and of course their money comes with expectations comes with strings attached and so that's how the candidates boats\nSo yes I Am blessed to be able to do some self funding here I don't know how anybody could unless they take corporate money so we have to fix that system you know the largest voting bloc in America that understand this problem is the people who don't vote at all\nThey are not crazy when they think that their vote their voice is going to be drowned out by the voice of the big special interests how big a factor as President Trump in your campaign is he's huge I mean I don't bring him up when I go door to door\nBut people blurt out that they want change they cannot stand the tone coming from Washington even Republicans not that they want to throw him overboard but they just hate the tone still he's\nNot on the ballot but is he on the ballot in a way I mean do you see your campaign in a way or the election and in a in a referendum\nOn Donald Trump it is becoming and largely through his own urging\nHe goes around the country saying vote for blank as a vote for me he is saying this is essentially a presidential election and of course interest is much higher in the presidential election and the reality is this is the first chance the voters in this district in everywhere in the country have to express their feelings about what they're seeing\nAnd the last thing I think anybody wants to see is Trump doing a victory lap around the rose garden on November seventh\nSo let me today Davis let me ask you about both at the things that's got lost just brought up first of all the money going into the race tell me more about that well Scott\nWallace has put at least eight million dollars of his own family fortune into the race probably more when the final tallies come in about eleven million dollars has gone into the race from outside superPACs most of that Republican superPACs to help fitzpatrick because he doesn't have the family money and all of it for negative aspect of it\nAnd what about the Trump factor we talked about that as it is that the president a factor in this race across the state\nFascinating yeah I mean when I talked to butters and ask them what are they thinking about the might mention jobs or taxes but pretty soon you get down to some version of I think the other side in this country has gone nuts and they have to be stopped and that really is about Trump or the feeling that that Trump has to be stopped or that those who\nScott Wallace is challenging the incumbent Republican Brian ... Patrick fitzpatrick is a former FBI agent the only form an FBI agent currently serving in the house but he's also been a vocal critic of President Trump on certain issues such as the way the president has handled the investigation into Russian interference in the two thousand sixteen elections\nAccomplishment is Patrick invited us to meet him at his parent's house in the suburb of ... town where he grew up as the youngest of eight siblings and despite being the beneficiary of a lot of these so called independent expenditures that they did was just talked about flowing into the race on his behalf it's Patrick said that he agreed with his Democratic opponent that there's too much money in politics\nI could not agree more that money in politics of the problem I was a supervising the FBI's political corruption unit in April of two thousand and one of the Citizens United decision came down ... my boss I got called up I had to speak to him about this issue of his question was what is this going to do door corruption cases that starts going increase the corruption\n\n\nI'm Janine hurts with these headlines authorities in Pittsburgh continue to search for a motive and the shooting at a synagogue this morning that left at least eleven people dead\nForty six year old Robert powers has been arrested authorities say he was injured and is hospitalized shootings being investigated as a hate crime\nDefense secretary Jim Mattis is in Bahrain attending an international conference on security he told a gathering that the killing of Saudi journalist ...

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the FBI is on the ground there helping to investigate the tragedy authorities are treating it as a hate crime NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas who's here with us now tell us more hello Brian either [noise]\nFirst of all what can you tell us about the gunman at this point [noise]\nWell we don't know a whole lot about 'em at this point has been identified\nGoing to look the special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Pittsburgh a man by the name of Bob Jones laid out a bit of that today a here's what he had to say about how this is going to move forward\nAnd over the next several days and weeks we will look at everything and the suspects life is home his vehicle these social media and his movements over the last several days\nAre Jones says officers recovered in assault rifle and three hand guns at the scene a when a agents are going to search is home they say that they'll take precautions in case there might be any sort of explosive devices there\nHe says the FBI does not believe at this point uh that the suspect had any accomplices or he was not known to law enforcement for today says uh and he also says that the suspects full motive at this point is unknown but then of course is something that the FBI is going to work to find out\nWhat the president has called this an anti Semitic act and authorities say that they are looking at this as a hate crime investigation what does that mean and what does that tell us\nWell first off yes attorney general Jeff Sessions has said in a statement that the Justice Department will file a hate crime or hate crimes and other criminal charges or in this case he says that there is no place for hatred and violence on the base of basis of religion\nOr the U.S attorney for the western district to Pennsylvania Scott Brady he says that prosecutors could file those charges as early as this evening but we're gonna have to wait and see what all those sort of charges are going to entail\nAnd can you tell us a bit more about what hate crime charges would mean\nRight in in some cases a federal hate crime charges would bring a stiffer sentence or to take into account that particular nature of of the crime in a case like this a former federal prosecutor tells me that it's likely wouldn't change that much\nBecause this sort of crime was eleven people killed uh the the sentence is likely to be significant anyways but federal hate crimes could bring into play a possibly the death penalty Pennsylvania does have a state death penalty although it hasn't been using in quite some time\nBut treating this shooting and prosecuting it as a federal hate crime does send a message of the seriousness of the crime and not the federal government treats it as such a you'll recall of course the case of Dylann Roof\nOf who was convicted in the killing of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston South Carolina the federal government in that case brought hate crime charges against him even though he was already facing state charges and ultimately a federal jury convicted him a and he uh he was sentenced to death\n[laughter] and it's freezing as you can to the degree that you know what happens next\nWell the FBI is just getting to work on this there's a large crime scene that will have to go through a half to collect evidence\nSocial media history there already accounts reportedly linked to him that appear to show a fair amount of anti Semitic sentiment a and the alleged shooter in this case it of course eleven in custody so possibly are looking to question him\nThat is NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan thank you so much for talking to us thank you\nAnd once again and we are broadcasting today from W H y y in Philadelphia that is where we were when we got the terrible news of the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning\nAnd that in a week when two people were killed in Kentucky apparently because of their race\nAnd pipe bombs were sent to a prominent figures apparently because of their political views\nBut even before those awful events we were hearing people across Pennsylvania tell us\nThey are frustrated with the tone of this country's public discourse the lack of civility they told us they hope for more unity and that the metrics that might have special resonance in Gettysburg the site of an ethics civil war battle in Eighteen sixty three one of the country's bloody is from within fifty thousand Americans were injured or killed over the course of three days\nBut now in two thousand Eighteen a group of residents there have been meeting up in a historic church to practice what others preach\nBringing people of different political views together it's called politics fact and stability Democrat car Thompson a former college professor founded the group and twenty Seventeen Darcy Meyer also a Democrat joined a group to her friendship with Tom sent and Republican Chad collie is also a member and he told me why he got involved\nIn twenty sixteen in previous years before that was very politically involved I was vice chairman of the Republican Party here locally during the twenty sixth in campaign a saw a lot of instability a lot of anger a lot of resentment and saw that coming to boiling point in many ways\nAnd uh it encouraged me to stop and think about what was going on in the nation and so I resigned from that and made a vow to myself to get more involved in the community and talking to people who were on the other side of the aisle\nIt sounds to me like this was something that was in you like I Need that you had I it's interesting that there are a number of\nNational political figures who have been calling for something like this players on cases in Ohio or maybe Joe Biden you could do the same argument ... former governor of Pennsylvania or sixty of homeland security\nBut you it sounds like that was something that was kind of in you and it was and thankfully car and came up with a structure for that ... what about you is this something\nThan a pretty staunch Democrat\nI that's where I live pretty much come down on on the left on most things call myself a progressive I never really thought about how important it was to bridge the divide until I got involved I think that\nRealizing that that there is valid points to be made on both sides and that there is a balance that we can find and has just on a real eye opening experience for me\nWhat did you and vision when you started this group like what were you hoping to accomplish\nI was hoping that we could come to understand each other more\nAnd I I'm very convinced as doors who just said that there are valid points on all sides like Darcy I I'm a very blue blue odor\nBut I think that the red voters have valid points that it will enrich all of us if we can listen to to each other it's sort of like the story of the blind men and the the elephant\nWhich um I don't know if you're familiar with the looked up locks book\nExpert political judgment in which he actually test the theory that the more you investigate various points of view the more likely you are to be correct in predicting what will happen in the future for example\nSo Darcy\nNot that you were saying I don't want to talk to do with people but um [laughter] what you know I'm hungry for this experience as others were what made you finally decide to come well what we're really was cars invitation and cars encouragement I got me to come to grow up\nAnd then it was the surprise at the civility has a conversation that made me stay I tend to be a fairly quiet person who doesn't express myself very well and a group situation and so\nI don't like the idea of going into a place where there's going to be arguing and fighting and and I feel like I'm going to just shut down I Will just shut down do this kind of environment where everybody is expected to have something to say really helped me and knowing that people were not going to argue with me or shut me down\nChat here's where I I have to impose upon our new friendship and put you on the spot sure because for a lot of people I think", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Live from Here", "city":
