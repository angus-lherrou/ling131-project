I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to\n[noise]\nGoing to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before and say something high [laughter]\n[laughter] okay I think it's good All right\nWhere we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking of start at the beginning yeah start getting health what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nThere is growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and killed when that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly aching and press how many people do is we killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire\nNear a case in Harrison than about John journals become\nSort of a national story\nI personally was having trouble and processing now like the number one\nThere a is a trendy one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply you know the problem is\nSo that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police for an itself in the\nPolice department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency ... and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete\nYou know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought\nLet's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nSo first study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country\nAnd Florida has wonderful public records loss\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places ... government bend sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida and\nThree hundred and eighty eight emails\nAsking for five years or so paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that should not for\nThis involves a year of work ... county police department is getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that involved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThing then put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of show that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times over the summer here to check it out yeah how many how many accidents you think you have sitting on us to probably five thousand pages a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me sit six feet tall we've had him broken\nDown by county but you can see uh [noise] so a or B county\n... Boynton Beach uh all the way through the alphabet and he basically just has a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers and spread across the entire desk and the combination of a use of force reports it's civil\nAnd media clippings the represent\nEight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and in six years time two thousand nine to two dozen fourteen [noise] so we did was\nYeah that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team didn't involve a an artist us packed Twitter chase [noise]\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people are hit by those poets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how that we can compile the data and build a data base and um [noise] you know hopefully draw some\nConclusions some lessons some solutions\nJust all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at will offer link to it from my website radio lab that are highly recommend [laughter]\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency to keep track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line and this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe said if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos that go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case huh we also broke these down into category\nAnd you said you know what you see like on the most basic level are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve among them the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is the case we're not taking the gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime in the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they called suicide by cop which is where somebody who's usually are mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people will cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThe news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nIt was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line and dealing with mental illness in this country [noise] but when it got to bend central question what do the number\nI think that a forty percent of people shot by police are black and that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics you know what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tell us much right now but the breakdown between fake ... for their same demographics and its without they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixteen numbers themselves don't really get you very far ... percent six ... he says one percent or more years just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to where we were in why we want to start\nThis methane gas comes from villages moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise]\nYou know I mean they're all written in this uh supplement investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call on this or to Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approach department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife that apartment to fight you know for every one of these [noise] every report because at least one human life someone was either you know more often than not gravely injured or killed [noise] uh so we have on the table that the investigation of the death [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one people who [noise]\n\nSo what do we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant boulders stock to follow wherever those stories might lead\nMatt guilty and then traveled around Florida and a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics you heard and today we're going to bring you one of those stories and if you're interested after this episode you can head to our website radiolab dark and you can hear part two of the series where we follow a total\nI think there'll be by in\n[noise]\nSo after the event ended at the community center crystal took a bunch of them are they all got in their cars and drove over to this

over to Christel House\n[noise]\nMid sized one story house into an end and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking Jews talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin where the kitchen cooking chicken\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like they bring with them you know their own stories these stories of creep up suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun [noise]\n\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together [noise]\nThere was some earth wind and fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing that I'm getting motel room again this is Natasha Clinton we started to fail for eight hours of\nSleep in each other bad on the couch you know a metric it becomes like a huge sleep over and reversal of policy for up to talk eight you know getting to know each other and some are the shows resources like therapy for I\nThink he's let in the past but there

probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight pays a three to one\nThree two one [noise]\nWe all started walking back up to the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just daring\nWith us and you know [noise]\nAccess to yeah yeah we haven't been I have\nBut what about that a very fine we've run out once a week

with the person you're trying to rest and communication with your fellow officers and those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek Derek Derek isn't\nJust a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name was in the face listen I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and

considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin Brett Kavanaugh is headed to the United States Supreme court this afternoon the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh on a fifty two forty eight vote one of the closest margins ever Kevin has been sworn in by chief justice Roberts in a private ceremony\nNPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow was in the Senate for the final vote and he's with us now from Capitol Hill Scott welcome thanks so much for joining us show the first of all set the scene for us for people who are not able to watch it\nYou know these votes are one of the most formal moments that never happened in the Senate Senator sit at their desk and vote one by one while the vice president presides so ads that what's happening person after person in the gallery interrupted with visceral personal protests strip mansion\n[noise]\n\nCircles who spent [noise] charging at arm's will restore order in the gallery so that's that's a woman yelling at Joe mansion that she was an assault or survivor that he's putting his personal politics ahead of her experience that happened over and over again another man yelled at Jeff Flake that he was a coward and all Thirteen people were removed from the gallery during the vote\nAnd I think that sums up this whole story and one scene in the Senate struggling with its formal responsibilities and made hyper partisanship an emotional set of circumstances and both parties retreating to their tribal basis that has all\nBeen so partisan and divisive um but even accounting for the theatrics county that people sometimes bring to politics got the other sense at this anger will linger in the Senate\nI think so uh senators from both parties are incredibly angry for very different reasons and just listen to some of today's concluding speeches Mazie Hirono Democrat from Hawaii says this is another case of a woman being ...\nThat could not see the truth of what Dr for I tried to counter\nAnd Republicans feel like this has been character assassination from day one here's John Cornyn\nI Am disappointed\nMore than I can say those who have unleashed these unjustified attacks on the judge and his family and disappointed than their lack of any empathy\nFor remorse for what they had put them through\nWell let's talk about that for a minute let's talk about the Republican view for him in his car because because many senators have said all along that they've found Christine positive for sincere and credible and yet they effectively discounted their testimony that they talk about\nThat they did Republican after Republican was making that same argument often and strikingly similar wording almost the exact same phrasing bet Ford was sincere that's a word that kept coming up\nThey said they believed that something happened to her but either that they didn't believe that Brett Kavanaugh was the one who assaulted her\nOr that they just didn't see any evidence backing for it up on that claim that was the final view from Susan Collins of Maine when she made that speech yesterday ensuring Kavanaugh would be appointed a confirmed to the court that there were no corroborating accounts more questions the not\nSo in the end we have the same result as Nineteen Ninety One when Anita Hill testified about Clarence Thomas a woman comes forward with allegations and the man she accused ends up on the Supreme

from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin as you've probably heard by now the Senate has voted to confirm DC circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAs you would likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh\nNow we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford the woman who told a Senate Judiciary committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her years ago when I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether Ford a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they have been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country has tremendous I'm not certain she has a sense of that yet there's the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but but certainly what she had done\nA has unleash something that is going to move the country in a better direction\nAnd have the courage to come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... ... what does professor Ford want to happen now with the banks you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and and it is now that the information be provided to the people making the decisions so that those making this decision can make an informed decision with all\nThe facts that's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she did want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get wasn't FBI investigation\nFBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford buttons Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information\nAnd so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting their vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect on both parties I made it there is some evidence that\nRepublicans are now much more interested in the midterms and they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what his doctor for think about that [noise]\nI think what she had done in in credibly important in that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and\nThis is going to be an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will because it has\nRaised a lot of passions and concerns among the American people and it's a debate we are going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat was Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before the final confirmation vote\n'em [noise]\nWeek Amazon announced a minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand workers starting on November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour it's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but as the new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider\nAmazon workers from across the country to find out their thoughts\nMy name is Emily buyers I'm forty three years old\nI work at Jefferson ville Indiana at at Amazon so on a day to day basis I Will work on a computer and just to make sure that our bends match up physically and virtually so I've been at this a film at center since it opened in about six years ago\nAnd I am making fourteen forty but after the pay raise goes into effect I'll be making her mouth roughly sixteen and I have a son who does travel ball and for me this means more sports equipment more opportunities to go to tournaments that kind of thing so for myself and my family\nI Would rather have the money on my paycheck now and the way the two years for my stocks to vast\nI don't want to get my name but I'm a Packer at a facility that center on the west coast and I've been doing it for about a year iron Thirteen Seventy five an hour and I will be earning Fifteen or five\nAn hour oh it's concerning us mainly is we're given a monthly bonus and when our holiday season comes around that bonus essentially doubles and we're worried about not getting or pay out and making less\nManning's first emerging is the worst things from us on for the worst in the ... century Miami I started working in the store\nIs a process and the company you received a merchandise [noise] to bring him venturing ours are making seven dollars for hours and now with the trees were going to be producing dollars an hour after November first\nBird side about it very hard to decode other provider narrow it can be too much harmony better quality ... with my family because I don't have to be looking for a full time job is going to change my life\nSo we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us think each who tell us a little bit more about how this Fifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work in our which Amazon employees are affected\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of they're just being fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour in addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will off to start at Fifteen\nThe points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with them you could hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses so particularly during the holiday season that you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does the company say about how the wage increase is a better deal\nRight so there have been a few reports and a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said we're really upset about the law specifically about the monthly bonuses\nAnd the stock options are a little bit more complicated essentially used to be that some employees would get vested in to the company and they would get the big massive bumped from stock two years later two years is a long time for somebody who works in a warehouse so the company on that front of the company says\nPretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for the stock options\nOn the monthly bonuses it's a little bit more complicated\nThe company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money with this Fifteen dollar minimum wage then you were\nBefore so I took part of the confusion might arise from the fact that this wage increase to the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees didn't know that it was coming any idea why why why did they announce it so suddenly and\nWhy no one is kind of known for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company um Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that the conversation at the top level was happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been a state of stories a highlighting some of the more um questionable activities at some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\nThere was that big a criticism that Amazon got when the company released their median income number\nThe median income was released at twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty six dollars this is just above poverty level for a family of four\nNow that is a worldwide number is what the company will point out that said this is the second most valuable company it is run by the world's wealthiest man so the contrast has been put in quite a bit of pressure for Amazon to to do something\nHere before we wrap up here part of the Amazon announcement also mentioned that the company plans to lobby for a higher federal minimum\nThat was one of the most important parts of their announcement at a very rare for a corporation especially for Amazon to take the kind of a very political stands and in this particular case I mean we're talking about federal minimum wage right now it's seven dollars and twenty five cents [noise] it is an extremely low amount\n\nI'm Janine

McDonald fatally CBD shut nearly four hundred people and all of those students were found to be justified and so there's this sense\nThat there's this one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat other police thing about this and other people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P than fraternal order of police who's that that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWell we'll just have some of the resident moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and starting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist\nBut defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with band I\nAh the officers that that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the fact that we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy but he's not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it's sad when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in the pockets of reporting on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these rest or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive policing practice or after the video was released to the shooting\nThere is a policy in practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd so and talking to activists who are pushing for police perform again they say this is one case\nThat we think some degree of justice was done but when we look at\nThe police department as a whole you know what his reform looked like you know what is it going to look like moving forward is a consent decree in the city is in the process of enacting a consent decree to reform the police department but isn't going to be effective because there have been promising the path\nThat the police department was going to be reformed there have been different panels for him to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so what's gonna happen from here [laughter]\n... she's the hostess sixteen shots at a podcast from WB easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune that's been following the trial of officer Jason Van Dyke and the shooting death of a crime McDonald's she was kind of to join us from WB easy chin thank you so much for talking\nWith human show\nNow we want to head into the barbershop to put a bow and it's incredibly divisive an emotional week in Washington DC the barber shop is where we gather interesting people to talk about what's in the news and what's on their mind so we're going to go back to the major story of the week the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd we've been hearing a lot from senators and spokes person is an activist but we wanted to see if we could broaden things out to hear other conversations\nAnd we thought who better to talk to the local radio calling hosts and journalist who hear directly from their audiences on a regular basis so we called Liz Redskins she's a reporter with Alaska Public radio who's been closely following one of the most closely watched senators Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski\nWho ultimately decided not to support the cabinet nominations the only Republican not to do so she's here with us from the studios welcome thanks

radio Carrie thank you so much for joining us Hi Michelle thank you and let me start by saying that nobody is pretending that this is scientific research but I did want to reach out to all of you because I Know that people your audience is reach out back to you and Kerry I'm going to start with you because you host a call in show and we pulled some tape from it let's just play a little bit of it here and it's\nThink that the Democrats are completely I used to be a Democrat I Will not be voting Democrat\nRather or just rather ... there's some really bad climate that we're in right now I I'm very dismayed with the choice of checking party of morals or character and also I think it was fairly obvious from proceedings that Kevin I wasn't totally truthful\nTo carry a ... as you can hear you're getting people from all across the political spectrum but I understand that you were actually telling us that the comments aren't falling neatly along the usual partisan lines tell us a little bit more\nExactly right or in the show that you're playing the comments from\nMy question to the audience was is what's going on with Brett Kavanaugh and the confirmation hearings motivating you as a vote or is it influencing the way you're thinking of some very competitive races in Minnesota\nAnd I you know I can usually predict\nHow the calls are going to come in what I Am saying is people are highly engaged and it really knowledgeable about what was happening\nAnd they were calling with some unexpected things to say I mean you hear that one caller saying I'm disappointed that it's all about party you hear the other caller saying I usually vote democratic this has turned me off and I think that's pretty representative\nOf the calls that I've been getting over the last couple of weeks about this people are really turned off\nThey were just joined honored by by the the barrel politics of this\nTruly what about you what are people tweeting you and same to you and social media and and and uh and elsewhere", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Live from Here", "city": "Pullman", "day": "06"}
