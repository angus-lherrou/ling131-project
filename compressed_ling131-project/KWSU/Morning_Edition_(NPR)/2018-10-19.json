some of the bill's provisions\nFinally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting\nBut even though when it comes to voter registration laws there is a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's oil carrying with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics and the government of work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration while other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal was All right here's our first listener question\nClaiming heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five however laws changed since the court granted black citizens' direct vote out of white citizen or seized barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial at first people staffing the POWs were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood but then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration and\nAs the century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote by the late Nineteen sir early twentieth century is a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machines\nWhat about the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens' well of\nBlack men were given the right to vote and the fifteenth amendment in Eighteen Seventy but at the Jim Crow laws and the south effectively\nStripped African Americans have their voting rights in terms of rights of course white women and black\nWomen couldn't vote nationally until the nineteenth amendment in Nineteen twenty but you know the slightest sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because they registrars had frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting All right we have a couple of\nAs a candidate for governor allowed to purge the voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state while he's a candidate\nBy them this is in reference to Georgia Republican

hold for minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nDo they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy pigment short and I live in Omaha Nebraska when I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me\nBecause I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office address how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWell they're complaining about it this has to do with the recent Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law does require a residential street address Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and pointing icy irony that the nation's original residents are being questioned

Vietnamese math they go to their customers are meeting these are our ... our diverse\nNow I realize my experience as an American very different from my dad\nAnd these generational differences extend into politics older Vietnamese Americans have tended to vote Republican many of them fled communism and they the Republican presidents from Reagan on as being tougher on communist leaders some younger people like ten term trend has been leaning more democratic and that is one reason\nThe party believe they can unseat the Republican incumbent here so when we went to visit the anthem train them we had heard that there were some political differences in her family though I'm not sure she herself new quite how stark they were\nHigh high\nShe invited us into her parents' home her kids were playing around with eating snacks and they were orbiting around the grandfather [laughter] how Tran is ... father he primarily speak Vietnamese and his everyday life including when he talk politics with his daughter\nShe's been backing Republican since he first started voting in Nineteen Ninety two and he told me he was certainly no fan of president bronco bomber who he said just wasn't tough enough on the world stage\nWhom are going to like him very much and and then what now I guess we're today we have Trump what do you think of Trump so far sofa\nIn this country if you're doing a good job what do you like what the unemployed to your loans uh-huh and the stock market in Brooklyn in Greece and so the economy is important to you yeah\nAnd this is this is um I open\nIt [laughter] I didn't realize how he he thought of trying to see how they talked about that so is this the first time you had a surprise that I'll have a conversation already other stuff that he does against the need yeah\nThe crackdown timeframe that the press on basic human rights women don't have the same right there and to see some of that happening now in America you know in some factions of government is scary because that was something that I never would imagine we will be in a situation where we have a prize said\nBasically calling to press the enemy of the people like we hear that from communist Vietnam so we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that would be reality here today\nCould you say that you're dead and yeah I'm just I just wonder why when Trump calls the media enemy of the people what your reaction to that\nMan you know I like all the calls and your doctor you\nKnow I'm not going to say from a swim time ... ... ... talk about what changes but they don't care about the two things you just heard her yeah CNN begins drum riff off to both team\nSo they're not they're biased yeah Fox News clearly a fire and I don't know if you're desert mountains of el ... they spend a lot to get a laugh or I'm Trump to Fox is like trying to you know make a phone [laughter]\nDo you think you think the media is too negative about Trump food\nIt's not fair to say that Russia interfered in through the election in this country mhm but when they know that\n[noise] why don't why shouldn't before the election [noise] the way until June ... elected and they might be an issue\nToo if if they find out that Trump worked with and the Russians where that would that bother you yeah but you don't you don't believe that yet [laughter]\nThey're doing proven that don't need to believe them you know do that\nBut I'm either at me I just don't know ... ... daughter all he believes\nThat the Mueller investigation should continue so that they have we have the facts I agree with that\nOr to somebody who ground yeah there are a lot of families who've been divided over their views of from what you hear like dinner conversations that yeah that go really badly in I mean people get it from the table yeah it I mean this is it doesn't seem to be happening in this\nYou know because I don't think our country should be torn apart because of one percent I clearly have strongly against you know what the president stands for but I also believe it's important to me\nNice to have these kind of conversation because they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad has a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother him because we have that freedom and that's why my parents let Vietnam to be here in the first place\nEverybody got to go to vote yes vote for tours and for future we thinking seemed like everybody should vote yeah\nAnd my father I didn't mention the any he um after the war he was a political prisoner ... banging on the other two years three years he was held in a political concentration camp I Know and I used\nTo do a re education and get him\nYeah we're the communist tri state or you know basically get him to change it thinking\nIt's powerful to hear you say that people should vote no man from mhm industry that you have\nYeah I just think we need a lot to protect our democracy\nDon't water bowl we would drummer right because the

postponed that after an attack that left to senior officials dead including a top police chief\nPamela constable covers Afghanistan for the Washington Post and she's on the line walking to the program\nI'm\nGlad to be with you I guess we should figure out what we're supposed to happen this weekend one of the original plan what's at stake and what's the campaigning bin Laden\n[noise] um the original plan was to have a very big nationwide election more than two thousand and five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament\nCandidates of all all flavors uh an philosophies ah there was lots of excitement about the election but also lots of concern and worry\nPartly because of threats by the column on which has now come true awe and partly widespread of widespread charges on that there was going to be massive\nSays a lot of enthusiasm but also a great deal of of worry a A N and an anxiety at the same time\nSo you've been reporting that in Kandahar Province of really large and important province the voting will be delayed for a week but this does raise a question what is possibly going to be any different in a week\n[noise] right and we don't know that uh obviously this is a a measure of taken on an emergency basis um just to to sort of calm things down I mean kind of hearts a very large province which is tough\nLost its police chase its intelligence tastes and its governor has been gravely wounded um there's a huge security vacuum people are very nervous and worried um so I think this is obviously a measure designed for short term relief of that\nI'm obviously decision will be made later on I I Would think and hope that that elections can be held there because it's a favorite populist lots and lots of voters um but let's let's see what happens tomorrow um let's see if there's violence elsewhere or not\nUm and to what extent that happens how how bad it is I suspect a generally speaking out they're going to be taking famous one day at a time here\nDoes it feel and the rest of the country with ... like a democratic process does do you feel like you're in the middle of a reelection campaign where the people's will might be expressed\nI Do it does ah it's been it's been a a a\nA nice experience so to speak out compared to\nPrevious elections here um you know record record numbers of candidates out and about a four hundred women are among the candidates was which is extraordinary a for a very traditional society like this one\nUp on the other hand candidates although they've been busy an active have not been doing a lot of public campaigning they've been proven that they've been cautious they've had inside events um it had a loudspeaker\nTrucks but you have not seen a massive public rallies\nA few have been held in the provinces and some of those have been attacked\nI'm so and and as you mentioned earlier hadn't hadn't candidates have been killed\nAnd well okay Pamela constable of the Washington
