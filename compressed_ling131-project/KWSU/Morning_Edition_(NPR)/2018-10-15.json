a wide ranging interview that aired on CBS last night with President Trump\nNPR's White House correspondent Ayesha Rascoe joins us now going good morning so Turkish investigators say a democracy Yogi was murdered in their country on the order of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin some on which would prove very complicated for President Trump who has sought to develop closer ties with him\nDid President Trump in this interview outlined what the severe punishment might be Saudi has proven to have been behind that\nShe did not uh and what he did do an outline what it will not be and that is it will not be any sanctions that limit a arms sales are banned arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nA and he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it it wouldn't be a good idea to go that route some lawmakers have caught for that action but he said that that is not\nA what he plans to do although he did say that he was very upset by this story and that he he said he will take strong\nAction and he at least open the possibility he said that it could be Saudi Arabia's top leadership so we just don't know what the consequences of that would be yeah so this was also and it's going to be the first time the president has really been pressed on climate change uh since he entered the White House\nWhat did he say he did it has his position changed at all he\nSaid he doesn't think it's a hoax the a and and he famously before he became president said it was a that that he believes climate change with the hope he\nSaid he doesn't think it's a hopes anymore but he still doesn't think it's manmade or it may not be manmade and he said if the climate is changing it may change back uh\nHe was really press them that's why he doesn't

Kentucky bourbon industry said they needed drank bourbon whiskey at the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world for resources at the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky with an alarm some show them I'm Michelle filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been ah we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six countries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr is it due to the point where it it's more than fifty percent of of the bigger players um but uh in the past few years you're probably global sales have been out facing\nYour domestic sales while and just to just be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over ...\nFrom the store to store but yes the I Would say they're international sales were starting to pay their domestic sales\nAnd the mid nineties what was the key free trade agreements they well an apt to any you agreements\nSo what if people thinking about here as those free trade agreements has become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens at this starts to escalate and that's the point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out\nWhat does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nUh we don't like the option is on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attack is no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs the consumer and hopefully you have people did you converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back\nA which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this then we don't like any of them\nStating the obvious to the state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot could ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand the ... winter so trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflicting feelings are we don't understand\nWhy would we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much uh uh come up as an\nIssue yet he made an issue like at election yeah it has come up I mean\nCongress and bar has been very helpful to us in the past few months he said the meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how does the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows will probably means Kentucky or he will note for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes uh\nAnd and he tells you understood exactly that is with the sushi could mean for us bourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called Burman thinks that I guess since the federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike you know highly David sandwich announced they can move some production overseas we can't do that\nWith bourbon you've got to make it here in America if he wants to like you better make Kentucky beginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been a I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all the scotch drinker so that we converted over the last few years\nThey were drinking before you know we might lose bar industry and if we lose them now than we might lose your for generation ferret\nGregory of Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage from hurricane Michael which had Florida's panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable roads and non functional phones and made life difficult for residents and rescue teams and for insurance adjuster\nWater just on the outskirts of ... miles across\nColony networks and the fried division of power hill a Florida homeowner's insurance company over the weekend he caught a cell phone and on near Panama City there were still places it wasn't safe for his team to travel\nFor a situation like that we're relying on aerial shots at a site or look at it\nAnd it wasn't just buildings that were devastated by the storm\nA lot of areas have lost a generation of timber poultry farms are hit pretty hard and the car industry is as devastated\nChris Chandler isn't adjuster with alpha insurance in Alabama he's been working in Houston county\nCaught was ready to be picked last week and a six to seven hundred mile per hour winds just blows it away but last April source of income as her livelihood\nEarly estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says the insurance companies will have substantial cost but Fitch also says the industry has quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so we had some good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now but communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler and Alabama says the damages upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your fingers and like everything\n... obviously that's not going to happen or you're you're you're talking to people to houses of destroyed all their belongings showed her pictures no amount of money is going to get an image back of your of your parents that are passed away to your child first birthday\nWhile some things are lost forever he says communities are already working together to start to rebuild can you know what I'm asking NPR News [noise]\nThis\nAnd they win back the house next month and that would create problems for the GM pi\nIf Republicans are unable to maintain their majority democratic rule will be very much in opposition to a Trump White house\nSo what's at stake for Republicans in the mid times you'll be hearing more at five thirty nine year old northwest public broadcasting\nAcross the country prison discipline on down harder on winning you can get written up for not closing your door you get written up or something on the phone without the mission and a low level infraction can have severe consequences like more time\nIt was bad because I live here I'm going to\nAn NPR investigation has afternoon on all things considered from NPR News\nI'm writing on the stations in northwest public broadcasting and on this Monday it's five Seventy\nI think there will be miserable and emboldened there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be emboldened because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same\nThing and something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know these consistently had forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's eighty or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we are dedicated to the electric re election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding gal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern that means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that eluded them over the past two years\nMara Liasson NPR News Washington\nAnd you just heard Newt Gingrich moments ago well there's a new profile of\nGingrich in the

and made him believe Trump could win the presidency\nAnd that's something Gingrich saw how a lot to do with how we see themselves the former speaker of the house made a name for himself by breaking a lot of political norms and refusing to compromise with the other side\nMuch like President Trump the Atlantic magazine's McKay cop and spent some time with Newt Gingrich recently for a profile he did it is called Newt Gingrich says You're welcome McKay coffins is in our studio this morning thanks for coming in thanks for having me so you went to spend some time with Newt Gingrich\nAnd he suggested suggested that you do still at the Philadelphia do\n[laughter] that's all right how come well he is a famous uh animal lover or news you know donated disease around the world he loves animals but I think also what became clear to me as I got there\nIs that she sees animals as useful metaphor is for him as we were kind of touring the zoo you as you know pointing out the lions and saying you know this is what the lions teach us about gender politics and this was what a crocodiles teach us about uh about the way that we should pursue change\nWhat was most interesting to me though at one point he was talking about chimpanzees or\nAnd kind of how how vicious they are or how aggressive they are\nAnd you know I said I didn't really know what to say so I started you know oh the the viciousness of the animal world and they kind of caught me off and was very stern and said it's not vicious it's natural right and and I think that he draws those parallels with how he abused politics and how you've used human affairs in general\nAnd he like him to themselves to other conservative leader he basically described to you for waves of contemporary conservative politics a Barry Goldwater responsible for one of 'em Reynolds\nTo the previous well she does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all these connected because you can make your case it philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal [laughter] which I think actually illustrates a broader point about\nThe politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal and nature partisan and nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's totally versus them President Trump it on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is the backstabbing duplicitous he and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable [laughter] uh was was rich as comfortable swimming in this one\nShe was I mean and a lot of ways he created the swamp said that Trump now says he's trying to drain right I'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that ... like most about Trump when you try to get him to talk about Trump is them or or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality\nAnd the larger than life style and how how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end no I mean where Democrats support the idea of what Trump has arrived in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions does Gingrich the all this as a long awaited political break through\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics have gotten more tribal and more vicious than have kind of shed a lot of these civilized and traits he thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and I and that's how he or she sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\nLike a ... of the Atlantic magazine his new profile of Newt Gingrich appears in this issue it is called Newt Gingrich says You're welcome McKay co op and thanks

democracy Yogi was murdered in their country on the order of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin some on which would prove very complicated for President Trump who has sought to develop closer ties with him\nDid President Trump in this interview outline what the severe punishment might be as Saudi has proven to have been behind than\nShe did not uh and what he did do it outlined what it will not be and that is it will not be any sanctions that limit a arms sales are banned arms so out of your abs\nAnd he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it wouldn't be a good idea to go that route some lawmakers have called for that action but he said that that is not\nA what he plans to do although he did say that he was very upset by this story and that he he said he will take\nStrong action and he at least open the possibility he said that it could be Saudi Arabia's top leadership so we just don't know what the consequences of

understandable\nIf executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need to drink bourbon whiskey as the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from Burma country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday we visited the town branch\nGregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nIn the same reasons why we have the world trade sources and the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon [noise]\nKentucky system lumps don't shelf that I'm just shoved filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world's best whiskey how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ten years you're you're probably are global sales have been out pacing\nYour domestic sales while and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over ...\nFrom the door to door but yes they I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global market has really increased ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what was the key free trade agreements they well a ... agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's the point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nUh we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase tests are taxes no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs the consumer and hopefully you have people you converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any of them\nStating the obvious as the state that voted for president Janette has voted for Republicans a lot to ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand that there are no winners or trade war and you know where we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why you know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you um ...\nIt has to come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he set up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring\nHow does the vice president response you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means Kentucky or he will not for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes ah in in he tells the understood exactly that this would this mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit and you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called Burman thinks that the federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirit tonight states\nUnlike Harley Davidson which announced they can move some production overseas we can't do that\nWith turban you've got to make it here in American if you want to sell you better make any concessions\nBeginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been a I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking from a price standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before\nYou know we might lose the bar industry and if we lose them now and then we might lose him for generations Sarah\nGregory Kentucky distillers

C. is the backstabbing duplicitous he and almost in the same grass he said I feel very comfortable to uh what was the Gingrich as comfortable swimming in this one\nHe was I mean a lot of ways he created the swamp said Trump now says he's trying to drain right I'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich like most about Trump when you try to get him to talk about Trump visited him or or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality\nAnd the larger than life style and how how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end no I mean where Democrats support the idea of what Trump has right in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institution that Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political breaks through\nYou know totally I think that it\nAnd I was kind of shed a lot of these civilized and trade she thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and I ... and that's how he or she sees the world and he's happy that have gone to where it is\nLike a ... of the Atlantic magazine his new profile of Newt Gingrich appears in this issue it is called Newt Gingrich says You're welcome McKay call them things much someone in thank you [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep and not northwest public broadcasting on Julie in colds now [noise]\nThe trial begins today in a lawsuit against Harvard University and the way it evaluates prospect she's the one thing that may come out at trial is the process harvest uses didn't use\nThe details are coming your way in just a couple\nOf minutes on the market place when you look at what state you [noise]", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "15"}
