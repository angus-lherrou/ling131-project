haven't seen a cavity all morning or hurt any man is the reason\nWe're looking for woodpeckers is that they are a poster animals for how scientists like gangs and has burger reimagining fire instead of seeing fires and negative thing that needs to be suppressed they are finding\nIt is essential to the wellbeing of many plants and animals for example burned forests may look barren to\nUs but from what eating insects in their predators they are a sleep waiting to happen\nGains marvels at how woodpeckers just seem to flock and\nOne thing we don't really know if there's got to be like some woodpecker hotline where they're like come on everybody there's a lot of food would get together\nAnd they're far from alone from Aspen to Morales from black bears to bees there's an incredible range of plants and animals that thrive in areas touched by fire one of the best known examples is the lodge pole pine which grows what's called sir rotten this cone\nAnd so every ... scale is held together by a drop of resin and it takes the heat of a fire to melt that residents cause ... skills to open up\nThe cone shed feeds the quickly grow into dense stands have young trees and the stands are one of the only hunting grounds for one of the country's most adorable and\nThreatened predators the\nCanada lynx okay so we're going to protest or a cat\nTo pretend we're a candidate link and what we want to find as our prize food and snowshoe hare\nThe crouching down stocks its way through the sixth French we can stay\nHere gas from us snowshoe hare so we know they've been here tells us just as good habitat for snowshoe hare and good habitat for links\nJust because these young pines are like a Goldilocks zone there just wrecked big enough to provide shelter for the bunnies with branches low enough for them to hide under\nBut it's the pines grow taller and their branches no longer touch the ground the bunnies and the links that hunt them have to go in search of new stance\n... explains that few northwest animals have about delivering thick unchanging forests instead most needed in a vault in clumps the mosaic of landscape to meet all their needs and the main driver behind that\nFifty years and history and take a look at a big landscape panorama what you would see is places that were burned yesterday places that were burned five years or ten years ago that create this Friday habitat but\nDecades of fire suppression of transformed that landscape\nWhere the forest as all grown up and blended there are some critters still making a living in that landscape but it has nowhere near the variety of the former landscape before it was a marginalized\nToday's the forests combined with the warming climate also set the stage for mega fires the result is to starkly contrasting landscapes and the dynamic far different from the one native animals involved with ... says the loss of that very habitat for creatures like the Canada lynx has been devastating\nLynch recovery is either made are are not here in this part of Washington this is the largest population in the lower forty eight states\nAnd it doesn't stop there fire has a crazy interaction with water by helping to thin out dense spreading forests it actually leads to more water flowing into wetlands and streams that encourages rich crude dining rooms for everything from year to fish\nNo one is advocating that we let all fires burn freely especially the human caused ones but the consensus is emerging that is crazy as it sounds we need to restore regular fire to the land to help our fellow
