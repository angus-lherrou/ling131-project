countries would still probably continue to see China as strong global actor ends protests ... neurons investor and all of those things\nBut independent analyst Wu ... says that China is having a harder time coming up with ideas that appeal to western audience says that's partly because ... says the Communist Party is publicly rejected universal values which it argues don't fit China\n... then then that China's leader publicly opposes everything from civil society to freedom and democracy that give some very little room to express themselves\nIf China has an alternative to what the west

David Greene and we're going to visit rocketing now it was once the capital of ISIS territory in Syria but it was captured nearly a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nOn the soccer stadium right in downtown rock and this is a stadium that ISIS used to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nHow is the city different than it was when you were there early in the years shortly after him was captured from ISIS\nFor Steve a rocket seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for the streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open it's kind of bustling in a way forward curious is the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIt's sort of a skeleton of a building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they said there were more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need for health officials say\nThey need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just\nFor the basic sort of water sewer electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYou know a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes you'll drive the street so look completely desolate from the damage from the IRS strikes ISIS blowing buildings up\nAnd you'll see your family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nThere are Syrian forces aligned with the United states controls that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself can run itself even though it is\nThemselves are setting up local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of that President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syria frightened\nThat was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder if the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa such as bomb removal and also education programs\nAnd that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars to the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with their basic needs reliving resentment will grow people become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq\nAnd other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass round so um there's a concern that\nISIS could continue to come back if the rebuilding effort doesn't continue\nNPR's Tom Bowman is in Iraq and Syria thanks very much Tom your workers do [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Draine and I'm Rachel Martin and I'm not covered by casting

territory in Syria but it was captured nearly a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nOn the soccer stadium right in downtown rock and this is the stadium that ISIS used to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that\nNow the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now how is the city different than it was when you were there early in the years shortly after him was captured from ISIS\nSteve Rogers seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for the streets are pretty clear clean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open is kind of bustling\nIn a way so it's curious is the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIs sort of a skeleton of a building and a lot of rubble just above the shops\nAnd they said there were more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need for health officials say they need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just\nFor the basic sort of water sewer electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYou are a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes you'll drive the streets so look completely desolate from the damage from the\nThe city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states it controls that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves are sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syrians frightened\nThat was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in rock or searches bomb removal but also education programs\nAnd that really worry a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars\nTo the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with the basic needs for a living resentment will grow people become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit\nAnd they still have money to pass around so um there's a concern that\nISIS could continue to come back if this rebuilding effort doesn't continue\nNPR's Tom Bowman is in Rocco Syria thanks very much time You're
