morning a court in Turkey has released a pastor from North Carolina who had been held under house arrest the case of pastor Andrew Brunson has been a priority of the Trump Administration and the subject of repeated talks\nAnd attempted high level deals between the U.S and turkey\nRuns in I Lived in Turkey for two decades and in two thousand and sixteen he was arrested along with tens of thousands of other people after a coup attempt he spent most of that time in jail before being allowed house arrest in July\nAnd parents Peter Kenyon is in Istanbul Hi Peter I know I told my case this one what do we know about pastor Brunson and the charges against him\nHe's lived for a long time and his mirror and western Turkey's about fifty years old he ran a small evangelical church there but then as you noted in September twenty sixteen he was arrested charged with aiding terrorist groups are both Kurdish militants and\nDoing that Brunson was basically caught up in this massive purge\nOf air to once suspected enemies president ... to one of turkey and in fact he was held at first in jail and then and this year he was transferred of house arrest in late July he's always denied the charges a there's been speculation that turkey was hoping to trade Brunson for some Turks being held in us jails\nA Washington's been pushing for his release a basically ever since he was detained\nWhat the court today about why he was being released today\nWell the court actually issued a conviction or with a sentence of just over three years the prosecutor it asked for ten but at the same time the judge has ruled that Brunson shouldn't serve any more prison time than he already has a in part taking his health into consideration\nOf the court also lifted judicial controls on Brunson that means restrictions on his movements have been lifted and he is now free\nTo leave the country are you know there were thoughts this might have happened earlier this year the White House thought they had a deal after President Trump spoke with the Turkey's president uh but at that point he was only moved from prison to house arrest and that upset the White House pressure's been ratcheting up ever since\nThere's been sanctions back and forth and there's no doubt that with the shaky economy here turkey really wanted to put this dispute behind them\nI mean the interesting things here is how involved President Trump and vice president Pence and secretary of state my palm pale have all been in please why one such a big priority for them\nWell or the administration's well known for a close ties to the evangelical Christian community in the U.S certainly a\nVice president Pence secretary state Mike Pompeo a well known devout Christians uh this is sure to pleased that part of Trump's constituency are also on the plus side for the U.S they're not actually trading anyone for Brunson it was a matter of putting on sanctions and they'll lifting them\nUh but I have to say this decision is also a big relief for turkey and president ... uh he's struggling to hold the economy together the\nCurrency is way down the inflation is soaring these sanctions from America on aluminum and steel and a cabinet ministers have added to the economic pain [noise] um and now turkey has every expectation that those punitive measures will now be eased er lifted wants pastor Brunson
