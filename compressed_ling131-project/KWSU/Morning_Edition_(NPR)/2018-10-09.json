police well\nWhen she talks about the husbands and fathers who've disappeared in China what does she mean\nTook office in twenty Thirteen and its neared hundreds of thousands of officials both on the

China uses Interpol under amongst presidents he was starting to raise some red flags earlier this year China attempted to issue a red notice that's an international alert for wanted person\nFor an exile weaker activists leaders are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with among is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over into international organizations\nReally interesting stuff NPR's Rob Schmitz joined us from Shanghai thanks Rob banks do\n\nAcross the United states more criminal courts are turning to video proceedings this isn't an effort to save time and money that that happens some public defenders and

in front of the screen and just to you sir no sir you know you couldn't say anything\nDavidson says when you're in the same room at the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them and he's noticed there's a greater chance to listen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared and video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nA shortage plenty to the judge what happened they told me to record\nSoon after Davidson was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison\nWhere Rosalie joy says she hears stories like David since all the time she's with the national legal aid and

already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process you are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction\nAnd as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom for my client unless my client stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase bail amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for

MORNING EDITION from NPR News good morning I'm David Greene and I'm Noel King until recently the head of Interpol the international police organization based in France\nWith a man named among Hong way he's from China but in a stunning move China's government detained mom put him under investigation and now he has resigned from Interpol I talk to NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz and ask them what do we know about my mum\nAlways sixty four years old he served in the vice minister of public security bureau which is China's national police in twenty sixteen\nHe became the first Chinese had of Interpol in his lecture was a big victory for China's government which under leader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate and extradited Chinese officials at it deems corrupt would escape China\nAs it turns out among themselves is now under investigation by China's orders for corruption\nWhat exactly are they investigating him for\nWe'll try to government hasn't released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how it to the attention unfolded have come from his wife grace among on September twenty fifth\nThe day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by in a mood to even nice to just in that she was in danger a week later she reported it\nShe said we had to go to the half of them will make children on them all the wind in\nChildren's husband and father and her name may no longer disappear\nAnd as you can hear in that tape now while she's crying during this part of the video with their back turn to the camera because she's received threats and is under protection by French police\nWell when she talks about the husbands and fathers who disappeared in China what does she mean\nWell she's talking about the government anti corruption campaign was launched by seeking paying immediately after he took office in twenty Thirteen and its neared hundreds of thousands of FIFA officials both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party\nIn fact the man who appointed mobile home way to vice minister of public security was Julia ... conga highest ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this campaign Joe was a former member of the poll up you're standing committee the group of seven men who rules China he was China's security czar before he was sent to prison for life and twenty Fifteen\nRob by removing them from the presidency of Interpol loses a lot of sway within that organization that much is clear what I mean for Interpol well even\nBefore this happened China's use of Interpol under amongst presidents he was starting to raise some red flags earlier this year China attempted to issue a red notice that's an international alert for wanted person\nFor an exile weaker active is ... years are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with among is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over into international organizations\nReally interesting stuff NPR's Rob Schmitz joined us from Shanghai thanks Rob thanks do\n\nAcross the United states more criminal courts are turning to video proceeding since in an effort to save time and money that that happens some public defenders and others in the criminal justice system are questioning whether the rights of those accused are being affected by this technology from Illinois newsroom in Urbana league games reports\nToday like most days thousands of defendants will show up in criminal court for their first appearance in front of a judge it's likely that\n... likes that system he's in Lewis ten in rural west central Illinois he demonstrates what his deputies used to have to do\nThey would have shackles on some other stuff we're going to be half of war or taking\nCare of their belts\nAre going to be trained together and you're walking down the line it's kind of like a three legged race\nStandard says the video system they now use freeze up more of his officers for patrol and he argues that the convenience of the system is better for everyone\nSo we can take them to put them in front of a video camera the judge has access to the video camera in our conversation just like we are now but there's just a video screen\nBut Charles Davis and says it's just not the same Davidson is sixty eight years old and a recovering heroin user who was in and out of jails and prisons in Illinois for over two decades he finds the video process both off putting and demeaning\nWhen I first went to the radio according to his below my because wasn't everybody to get up and go in front of the screen to you sir no sir you know you couldn't ...\nTo Davidson said when you're in the same room at the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them and he's noticed there was a greater chance to listen to what you have to say he said the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nA shortage glued to the judge what happened they told me to record\nSoon after Davidson was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison [noise]\nLawyer Rosalie joy says she hears stories like David since all the time she's with the national legal aid and defender association and says the increasing use of video court had some defense attorneys concerned that alienates the accused from those deciding their fate\nEven before the proceedings began you already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process you are treated as\nThe least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction and as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom for my client unless my clients and shoulder to shoulder to me\nThere's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase bail amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public on the prosecution side many defend video court for its costs\nThat's unfair to defendants for NPR News I'm only gain in Urbana, Illinois [noise]\n\nThis is NPR News for\nA year after Harvey Weinstein
