called a short pulse amplification this is a technique that allows you to take a pulse of laser light and make it more powerful and that was a real problem early on in the development at the laser or you know lasers were developed decades ago but then\nThey sort of got brighter and brighter and then they stalled out and this technique really allowed them to grow brighter still and that helped them find many applications\nOkay we're going to talk about the applications in a moment but I Do want to ask how big a deal as it to see strictly to see her name attached to the Nobel Prize in

you can manipulate very very small things are really tiny particles when you're ... individual Adams even wow and so what are the practical applications of the work of these three people\nWhile the optical tweezers are used in a variety of applications um for moving around small biological molecules proteins DNA things like that and also in physics it's used pretty widely\nUm and then the lasers

cats\nThe Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks\nThe Monday after the women's march\nSeriously what are these women gonna do not

well in part that anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protest it in ways that we understand correctly to ...

built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out our condemned it in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment\nI think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading thinkers of so many of our social movements in ways that have remain invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost

around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases have been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was Anita Hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq's\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained\nBut in fact all of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to

are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this was part of a long process social movements take a long time and the kind of anger that women

French scientist and Donna Strickland a Canadian both of whom did much of their work at the University of Rochester what does that work\nThey did something called a tricked pulse amplification this is a technique that allows you to take a pulse of laser light and make it more powerful and that was a real problem early on in the development at the laser or you know lasers were developed decades ago but then\nThey sort of got brighter and brighter and then they stalled out and this technique really allowed them to grow brighter still and that helped them find many applications\nOkay we're going to talk about the applications in a moment but I Do want to ask how big a deal is it to see Strickland to see her name attached to the Nobel Prize in physics\nWell this is only the third Nobel Prize in physics to go to a woman in the past hundred and Fifteen Years while at the last one was in Nineteen sixty three and so Donald strictly was asked about this in a press conference and even she seem a bit surprised\nBy that fact you say the woman ever getting that no prize in physics let's get comments on that\nOkay I might have been marketing\nBut it is true yeah there's only been a few others in Nineteen sixty three in Nineteen Ninety three and there are many good female physicists who has been widely held\nWere overlooked does surprise does this suggest a an advancement for women census is\nSay it's more like the Nobel Prize is trying to stay relevant that in the heart scientists especially ah Internet entrepreneur and started this new age we're in have started giving their own prices\nTo look for a Nobel Prize that prize was for three million dollars the Nobel or just for around a million new so you know I think the Nobel Prizes are falling behind the times and they recognize that and that's really interesting\nOkay there's a third Nobel Prize winner Arthur Ashe gun in his name Bell Labs in New Jersey the place where he did a much of his work um optical tweezers there's the phrase in front of my eyes here what an optical tweezers\nThey are actually exactly what they sound like which using lasers which is light to mold physical things objects wow and that actually works believe it or not light can exert a little bit of pressure and so\nIf you tuned to lasers just right you can manipulate very very small things are really tiny particles when you're having an individual Adams even wow and so what are the practical applications of the work of these three people\nWhile the optical tweezers are used in a variety of applications um for moving around small biological molecules proteins DNA things like that and also in physics it's used pretty widely [noise]\nUm and then the lasers are the main sort of public use most common uses laser eye surgery are tall simplification gets used to and laser eye surgery want this day changed\nThe lives of many people over the last many years and fortunately not mine so the glass okay All right Jeff thanks very much for your\nAh twenty twenty vision on the Nobel Prize in physics from NPR's Geoff Brumfiel right here on MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel\nI'm not broadcasting on the land right now [noise]\nThe marketplace morning report is ahead this morning at seven fifty one and a little bit later in the eight o'clock hour on your NPR classical music service MORNING EDITION continue with the story that on Monday President Trump touted a new free trade deal with Mexico and Canada\nThroughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA and today we have kept that\nPromise more on that agreement and White House trade with White House trained advisor Peter Navarro conversation it's at eight of sex after eight of sex that is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Pullman", "day": "02"}
