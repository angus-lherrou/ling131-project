Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as as cabinet under siege a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard let's\nGo back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of that\nAssault even under the law standard of proof she concluded quote a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this cases even weaker than that Dr Ford identified\nOther witnesses to the event so knows witnesses either refuted or allegations or fail to wreak corroborate them\nFor the reasons discuss all I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor could bring this case based upon the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy their preponderance of evidence standard end quote\nWe have thoroughly investigated judge Kavanaugh's background\nIn addition to the prior six FBI fall feel feel background investigations were the interviews of nearly a hundred and fifty people who are known judge Kevin on his entire life\nThe committee also separately and thoroughly investigated every credible allegations that we received are more than twenty committee staff members have more night and day over the last many weeks tracking down virtually all leads and at the request of undecided members\nThe FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week\nThe FBI interviewed can more people related to the latest credible sexual assault allegations and the FBI confirmed what we Senate investigators already concluded that is is there is nothing in the supplemental FBI background investigation report that we didn't already know\nThese on corroborated accusations have been on equipment slates and repeatedly rejected by\nA judge Kavanaugh and neither the Judiciary Committee or the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations there also is no contemporaneous contemporaneous evidence\nPrior FBI investigations are conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service nothing and investigator including career FBI special agents does ever be good enough\nTo satisfy Democrat leaderships in Washington who staked out opposition\nTo judge Kavanaugh before he was even nominate there is simply no reason then to the judge Kavanaugh a seat on the Supreme Court on the basis of the evidence presented it was the Democratic strategy used against judge Kavanaugh\nHas made one thing clear they will never be satisfied no matter how fair answer all the process is thirty one years ago\nThe Senate Democrats treatment as Robert Bork\nTheir playbook remains the same for the left wing advice and consent has become\nSort of listening to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa this is special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some voices from the United States Senate as they prepare to vote\nOn the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court to vote again today is to end debate the formal vote to actually confirm or not\nWould probably be sometime tomorrow we just heard a reference there to Robert Bork a man who was a nominated to the Supreme Court by president Ronald Reagan in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd ultimately rejected after a campaign by Democrats who said that his views were extreme Charles Grassley argues that essentially the same thing is happening now that Brett Kavanaugh's being pork too which is the way the conservatives refer to this Nina Totenberg is that a fair comparison\nWell I actually don't think it's a fair comparison I'm Robert barks nomination has been a sore point for Republicans now ever since it happened ever since he was defeated\nAnd there's been a lot of academic studies now of the confirmation process and how Bork ferrets and the fact is that Bork went into his confirmation hearings with the votes to easily be confirmed\nA liberal interest did have some ads against him and they were chump change compared to what the money that's spent today I mean I think they mainly aired in Washington D. C. that they would get written about by the likes to be in me um but\nHe had very strong views and quite as it turned out in the view of many Americans and their senators extreme views\nBecause Kavanaugh has pulled his punches quite deliberately are not quite said what does for us because\nActually correct so for for example said he's sticking to his huge it's a one person one vote decision was wrong Kavanaugh\nOr would not really express his views on almost anything he he would always say that Supreme Court precedent um I I as a judge had to follow the Supreme Court precedent or things like that so\nThey're they're not hurting let me stop you there because Charles Grassley has managed to speech and now Dianne Feinstein the equivalent Democrat on the Judiciary Committee has to be drawn to remark was as some of them they\nWere over Ninety percent of its record has been hidden from the public and the Senate\nNever before have we had a nominee display such flagrant partisanship and open hostility at a hearing\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away from a vote in the United States Senate to end the debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that hurt all the final votes would likely be sometime tomorrow\nSenators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios in who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nTherefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republican especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend could vinyl say okay\nFine I'll end debate that I'm not going to vote for this guy\nAnd it sounds like if there's four key votes this has got to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most ah let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to living her closing argument let's listen to her\n[noise]\nUp okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact\nSo we're now going to hear or in their entire already over the next few minutes from two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had\nThe other senator we'll hear from is the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central to the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell\nSteer to President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch to confirmation it is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes needed Totenberg is with us here in the you know what's on your mind\nWell you know Mitch McConnell is not what you would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing that final cleanup hit for their sides\nBut don't be fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he\nHas done amazing things for a matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this was true he negotiated with vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nI you know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there a guy he's the appointment he's\nBeen marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that it can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days in Brockton what's the scene like this morning\nWell Steve there are some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the day is still young [noise] ah there is a group of speakers that are standing up to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away a\nThey have had a number of people come up and share their stories a lot of people who have survived a\nSexual assaults will trauma and the sharing the story is basically saying we cannot put a Supreme Court you cannot elevate someone to the Supreme Court who's been accused of such crime wrap it up and down to what\nThey're saying his if one of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in the last several days well we'll talk talk about that a little bit more on mom and apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\nStored in chapters in the long history of the federal\nSelected judge Kavanaugh\nFrom the list of names pre approved by hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest as a trifling concern compared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care and achieving a partisan majority on the Supreme Court\n... worse than when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee\nShielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public just guarding decades of bipartisan precedent\nAnd warning norms of trans parents the end of fairness and finally the dam broke under the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh\nCommitted a sexual assault\nIn twenty and Eighteen so Republican majority conduct at a hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings in Nineteen Ninety One\nLook fair by comparison in this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side\nNo independent investigation of the fact to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel to put a witness Dr Ford on trial [noise]\nOnly at the eleventh hour urging a breakaway members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly to a one week investigation of the allegations\nAn investigation which was then severely circa ... by the White House our Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man but nothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for delay\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control of when nominees are brought to the floor leader McConnell could have moved this nominee two weeks ago\nOne week ago Democrats had nothing no say and don't\nWhen it comes to comes to the floor\nBut in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward because he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats for moving forward\nWhen it comes to complaining about the leg\nGarland Republicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign or the politics the personal destruction with this nomination in reality again they're using Democrats as a strongman\nBecause what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward\nHer conscience there and our Republican friends are are Republican friends accusing Dr Ford and her deeply held memories of what happened to work\nOf a smear campaign are they using doctor for the smear campaign of engaging in the politics of personal destruction because that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony and then trying to blame Democrats [noise]\nI don't blame them they have a flawed nominee\nThey don't want to focus on the nominee when future Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw on no lessons from the Senate's conduct here let them look back on this chapter\nHas the shameful combination of the scorched\nEarth politics practice by the hard right in America\nPeople who will stop at nothing to entrench an advantage on our nation's courts let the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh\nBe recorded as a sorry epilogue\nOf Justice Scalia's seat the AIG know many at the end of bipartisan cooperation and consultation on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices\nFor whom or Senate Republican leaders willing to discard\nAll semblance of fairness to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh\nCertainly a product of an elite education\nBut also someone with hard right\nConservative jurisprudence far far away from what the average Americans\nBelieve why most Democrats opposed examination at the outset\nFields like ancient history now but let us not forget that most importantly we strongly disagree with a number of judge Kavanaugh\nWell qualified judge show our highest court\nNot any more out after all this United States Senate will also be making a statement within the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence\nOr will reaffirm that in the United states of America\nEveryone is innocent until proven guilty will either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient\nAnd signal that media bullying\nThe mob can attack\nAnd the Senate cash all set up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation will still define\nWill either give notice\nIt totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough to destroy on Americans live\nOr will declare that our society cannot must not will not set the bar so low show madam\nPresident today is a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well\nThe ideals of justice that have served our nation\nSo well for so long for on full display\nSo let's get back in ... through the choice moments that the Senate and the American people have been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle\nOf the last two weeks the very not\nJudge Kavanaugh was announces the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare that just nominate would pave the way to turn it\nHis audience\nCrowds of are allowed protesters still filling out in the blanks on they're picking sides there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination I was a great\nMoral struggle\nIn which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil\nOr you're fighting against a more recently\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit\nHe deserve less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagreed with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\nMore recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great confidence offering\nHis expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties\nThat was incredibly enlightening\nBeer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings\nAt play until of course a number of judge Kavanaugh last night studying stripe earlier this week\nShe'll stop and consider the snap shot the absurdity the absurdity the indebtedness say this\nIs our approach to confirming a Supreme Court justice\nThis is the Senate contribution to public discourse [noise]\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process would be about\nDelay obstruct and ... and before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce they'd made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation\nMere hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated my friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated it was clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means necessary\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing could get most Democrats are considered is nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction and so called\nResistance until the final vote was called for a fair wage\nAre parts played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here there were excuses for delay those fell flat there were ... destruction to judge\nUsual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice happened every time\nHospitals that went on\nHospital Navarro people hospital workers tram old tricks same old playbook but here's the problem\nThe old players weren't working the distortions were being liberated drowned out\nBy the facts\nSenators received an reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination that for every previous Supreme Court nomination combined [noise]\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve year record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court\nThree hundred plus a pen which we are sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts was nothing like the character [noise]\nNothing like the character\nSo is there a matter of president they owe taxes weren't working one going to get the job done\nThe resistance demanded more try something new they said well we all know what happened next I'm corroborated allegations of the most sensitive most serious or were quickly sharpen\nAnd a political weapon\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and coughing up to the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nInto the press\nFor chairman Grassley admittedly sat out on a sober focus search for the truth the committee collected testimony organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh\nFBI investigation\nBy and embarrassed that are the facts the actual facts\nProved to be straightforward\nNo corroborating evidence not not\nWas produced a support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh\nWell that wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after all we sort of get it by now\nWhen the very FBI investigation for which they'd been clamoring turned up no new evidence\nThe Democrats move the goal post yeah again\nI Believe the latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid now let's do this\nBecause individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand about nearly forty year old allegations\nWeren't treated as a central witnesses let me say that again\nThe latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid\nBecause individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand\nAbout nearly forty year old allegations\nWeren't treated as essential witnesses never mind that they didn't actually witnessed anything they didn't want us any time [noise]\nSo let's be clear madam president these are not witnesses these are people supposedly in possession of here say\nThey'll say first heard thirty five years after the suppose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUm and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe Manchin\nA at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live a vote is in is it fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so and do you see that's right or you can't have a firm sense of how the final vote goes until they banged the gas\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assumed that they know who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice age here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference what we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay de telegraphed really even when he made the compromise of ...\nAnd Chris Coons Delaware as he got into Delaware went and checked to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for ... cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report the Senate\nHas only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing amongst themselves and they have been a and it ruins at art it in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nA that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench you would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the the bench in a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this confirmation process is generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to death\nOn the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been who've been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking only we only had ... senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is the correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia who we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin that's right\nBrett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is key procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination or you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabin all along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski boating now Joe mansion isn't a really tough spot here he's one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote in the Democrat\nAnd he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you were going to see a lot of liberal blowback on mentioned in the final month\nOf he's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate to test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us this is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally they're not quite final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex component has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate\nMarco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program a Steve could be with him so what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell and you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and\nIs that frankly you know I think was looking for something\nTo get them to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been a doozy has them gap has allowed the service has shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that you know really arrows if it'd be in part because of of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have a when I think is just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of ... in that a parent gain and enthusiasm right now we're on a months out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters as ... and that was the challenge for us going into the ... it's why the out of power party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are gonna be more amped up then the people\nThat are kind of fat and happy but now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen in the way that the Democrats from the Republicans perspective have basically engaged in in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking\nConservativism Republicans as a whole and Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to to succeed is just sort of the nail on the coffin in terms of locking down for a look at it is yes\nAlex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because it was probably almost certainly be after the election\nI'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually was something different that Republicans were determined to have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as you termed it for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishment to run on\nWhile I think the process is the process and in a while I understand that Democrats would like to draw this out forever because they don't want to fill the seat with the Trump appointee from a Republican perspective we wanted\nWe wanted to have a a a another plenty on the bench last week so that they could be there for the start of the the new Supreme Court session\nSo I think part of it is driven by the Supreme Court counter part of it is driven by the fact that we don't want to have a nominee just hanging out there and definitely while the character assassination continues\nAnd then yes I Do think part of it is the the political factor\nWhich is there's an opening on the Supreme Court if we can put it another try\nBase just like tax reform I should get deliverable for our base I think if you're a Republican voter who has mixed feelings about Trump's personality as frankly I Do you look at these results over the last few years between tax reform but we're done with judges", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "05"}
