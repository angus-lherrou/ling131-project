Halloween costumes\nAnd the controversy on the outside of New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and who doesn't want Diana she went to an around her one day I I don't know how like that got raised about Harlow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the money David ... okay so this is not the first time that making Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she is in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nProbably and can't watch at home than it and just as white as it was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comment\nWill these aren't ah the only examples um there are number I remember back in twenty eight and the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claim that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group ... group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a sea started criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period focusing on it as though was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal strategist for about ten minutes to she felt was feeling to take it a sufficiently seriously\nUh one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the ... a former LA up a

thing she welcomed among show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged who her remarks about uh what she felt was the acceptability of blackface\nNBC's nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole thing about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something and how to make and Kelly's collie and their attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor ah of any made of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which\nIs really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the weight and that we can handle these comments say something bigger about the way networks in companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\n[noise] well it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know direction at times very slow of major news organizations to me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuse her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received a very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News you just play some popular colleagues and that her ratings themselves were mediocre\nAnd that even before all this happened uh she'd been discussing with a network

I'm a ... on a long tradition that anti Semitism\nWhere George finance or a portrayed as the shadowy Ficre through manipulate the politicians and therefore I think it's a pretty good indication of that tradition\n[noise] well what the people in his native hungry think of Soros\n[noise] he was a hero early on in the transition away from communism things have tonnes more recently because of the anti migration populist nationalism that has taken over the country\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of several books in a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations thank you so much to\nPresident Trump is headed to Charlotte North Carolina today to rally supporters for Republican congressional candidate mark Harris\nHarris it's gotten a tight race in a former Republican strongholds against Democrat Dan McCready NPR's Kelsey Snell has more on how major shift in North Carolina politics mirror changes across America\nFor more than fifty years voters in the ninth congressional district in North Carolina have been any Republican Congress\nBut things are changing this year Harris a conservative Baptist minister is slipping in the polls behind mccready a Democrat and former marine David ... a professor of political science at Meredith College says the Trump rally is a sign that Republicans have to fight harder than there used to\nThe fact that President Trump is coming in um it was a sign that they still see that raises winnable it would have been inconceivable two decades ago for a Republican president\nAnd other countries are flocking to jobs in places like Raleigh Durham and Charlotte young generations of farmers are doing it too he says like the rest of America Democrats in North Carolina dominate the cities and suburbs but things change the further out you've got\nYour work at the political finds that I mean you can almost see other county line the shift between the Democratic signs were on one father county live and you move into another county more rural county and all of a sudden it's strong country\nThe line is it's so clear in other areas like Polk County where the view of the political trend line depends on who you ask\nCounty commissioner ... says the area is about sixty percent Republican but he's the only elected Democrats and well you see just party dominating in statewide offices in the future that doesn't mean the entire state is turning blue\nWearable hundred ... a legislative for sub or very rule which for him to go much more Republican\nCounty Republican chairman ... says rural Republican voters like Trump\nI'm seeing a trend where there's a movement away from the Democratic party\nTo the Republican Party just because there is a lot of dissatisfaction with what has been going on at the national level\nTrump's rally could be the clothing pitch for Republicans who wants to keep at least the ninth congressional district from turning blue Kelsey Snell NPR News county North Carolina\n[noise] this is NPR News\nI'm tired of family worked at the same auto plant in Michigan until it closed during the recession what somebody [noise] like losing your life now with unemployment near record lows what does the recovery look like to them\nLike a fantasy world or something and I'm Ari Shapiro in Michigan views of the economy and the midterms this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News\nAri Shapiro and Tom cocaine later today on your drive home for all things considered here on end up at U.

NBC's Today show anchor Megan Kelly caused outrage with some on air remarks about Halloween costumes\nAnd the controversy on the outskirts of New York with ... as she dressed in Diana Ross and who doesn't want the animal she wants to look like they on around her one day I I don't know how like that got raised about Harlow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup and itchy appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David ... okay so this is not the first time that making Kelly has made controversial comments about race he or she is in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all you can watch at home than it just is white she says it was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments\n[noise] well these aren't the only examples of their number I remember back in Twenty years and the span of Jesus comments back from\nAnd twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group black hate group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period focusing on it as though it was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal

a farm in on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about ah the question of are African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited thing she welcomed them on the show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged Hoover remarks about ah which she felt was the acceptability a blackface\nNBC's nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole thing about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something important making Kelly's colleague an attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American incurred uh of any meat of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which\nIs really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder did the way the network at handle these comments say something bigger about the way networks and companies are are Tyler I tolerating racialized or racist comments\n[noise] well it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know the reaction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuse her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News ... just play some popular collies and that her ratings themselves were mediocre\nAnd that even before all this happened uh she's been discussing with a network another role there because she needed to get out of that show now the show's gone and she's a negotiating her
