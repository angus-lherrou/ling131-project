if\nThat's not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to a climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are Moe level it out to control the world Jeffrey her for historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a person gets paid by sorrows or somebody\nThat from a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism it seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Jeffrey her far used that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti\nIn general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nThe the ... do you ever see the elite\nWhen people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent ... whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in law are Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people\nKnow so then what's the connection\nHe wants to win\nHe has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that his base in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guys semi school might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they can find other people that share their views and urged them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of an anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when

looking to get costumes we want to be where they are you know what it is a very delicate balance for small business like ours the cost of doing business can be quite high so we have to make very good and thought out choices\nPicky says in the past they've opened as many as eat pop up shops but this year they only have one he says they're facing more retail competition and getting squeezed by more expensive short term rent many landlords used to shine short term races but Steve Short with commercial real estate service Jay allows says that view appears to be changing\nI definitely think it's a benefit um it really allows a landlord to activate the storefront in activating storefront in any way is always a good thing Halloween shops you know they're fun they're positive they're engaging they attract families\nIn shorts notes that pop ups aren't jak holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model to sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stores may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect the model is New York based storefront think of it like the air being bea of commercials spaces CEO Mohammed oh wash says everyone using pop ups from small Internet retailers to large companies like Facebook\nWhich is you know so the push coming from ... to regret we walked in the bus which on that and we've seen a lot of celebrities in like fingers and commerce function for their own brand\nHe says record labels have even set up pop up centered around a specific artist or watched as as recently as five years ago many landlords would rather sit on a vacant property for a year then entertain a short term lease but now he says more are seeing the upside of getting rent from a pop up store\nYou're changing their traditional model for long term is and you're listening to buy a space which he's getting booked every day or every week\nHe says in some cases the pop up into turns into a permanent tenet\nThere is absolutely no duct right now the short term is in your long term\nWhen it comes to pop ups landlords can charge higher rent in some cases making that more attractive than long term retail leases NPR News I'm Suzie on Chicago [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nHundreds

last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are Moe level it out to control the world Jeffrey her story at at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to our surrounding asylum gets paid by sorrows or somebody\nThat from a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean the President Trump is promoting anti Semitism it seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel but Jeffrey her fired used that any promotion of conspiracy theories\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory\nThe Jews run the world purpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element to sense is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nThe the ... do you ever see the elite\nWhen people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent it whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in law are Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know so then what's the connection he wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how\nTo appeal to the resentments and hatred that his base and you can order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then he's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual anti Semite school might have been very isolated but now have these platforms with they can find other people that share their views and urged them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of an anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply\nOver the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year
