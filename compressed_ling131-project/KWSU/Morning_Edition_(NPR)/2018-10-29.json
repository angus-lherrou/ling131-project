MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm David Greene Brazil has elected a new president John ... and our own and he is from the far right [noise]\nThere were celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro the continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain failed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he'll take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy\nBecause they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and the union for the restoration of national pride I think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate financial and Daschle so comprehensively\nI should say the most amount of himself insists the survival of the democracy is not an issue here last night he again and promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted\nOff was he read out parts of the constitution to reporters\nAbout the need for the future president to respect to the judge had to remind him and people that people really do about the constitution and what it said yes and I think that underlines the extent to which these he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget it\nThe damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt for example his Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not at home and\nHe's really on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any racism I don't believe that I think he really put die\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said that does have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to that ... it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David I'm sick of robberies and the sky high murder rate yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil new president NPR's Philip Reeves reporting on that election in Rio thanks\nYou're welcome now we have more of a lot of social media site where the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect reportedly posted anti Semitic attacks\nBefore walking into the tree of life synagogue with for weapons Robert Bowers apparently got fired up with words he reportedly used gab which calls itself an alternative to Twitter and its popular among the far right Here's NPR's Jasmine Garsd\nIs a site that proudly promotes free speech at first I didn't let anyone say anything but it's been controversial critics have called it a whole for anti Semite and white nationalist\nRobert Ballard with a user before allegedly going on a killing spree he posted about the Hebrew immigrant aid society\nA group that supports refugees he said the group quote likes to bring invaders not kill our people I Can't sit by and watch people get slaughtered screw your optics ongoing in Andrew tour by is the CEO of ...\nIn an interview with NPR he defended the plant\nWhat would you expect us to do what I was like for you you you want us to censor anybody that says the phrase ongoing in that what you're proposing hair wide running from the ... and here's the thing the answer is a bad speech or hate speech however you want to define that is more speech and always will be\nWhen this online free speech become a threat this isn't the first time the issue has come up in social media just last week it came to light that the men accused of sending explosive devices to prominent Democrats and the media had a history of threatening tweets\nTour but says gab follows strict rules including notes wraps she says he created gap because he's someone no room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nWhen there are thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone to kill Donald Trump thing they're going to kill Donald Trump expressing hate\nToward white people towards Christian towards minorities who may on now keep weren't Donald Trump or they allow hate to be spewed at certain groups and certain people\nSo where is the line between free speech and inciting violence\nI think the line is we're free speech become a threat\nKelly McBride is a senior vice president at the Poynter Institute for media studies she says ... is prioritizing free speech above all other constitutional values\nAnd that is not necessarily what our constitutional famers intended right they didn't want the government curbing free speech\nNor did they want citizens to be responsible with their speech she says\nLast year Google band gaps up apple rejected it and Microsoft terminated its agreement with that last month just in the last twenty four hours at least two Web hosting platforms have suspended gab CEO Andrew ...\nIs not backing down we're not going anywhere\n... says gap condemns the shooting but he thinks it's now being targeted unfairly over the weekend the social media site was filled with anger some of it directed at the Jewish community Jasmine Garsd NPR News\nSo that was over the weekend and then last night gab released a statement saying it would be accessible for a period as a transition to a new

...\nGood morning David so significant moment here medical speaking of the nation about her decision what what is your saying [noise]\nShe she sounded very steady and she looked a little sad but she said that she started before she was not born chancellor\nA that it has been a daily honor but also a daily challenge to serve as a chancellor for the past Thirteen Years and as head of her party for the last Eighteen but that it was time to to move decide to listen to what citizens had to say uh and and that is that they have a lack of faith in her government on and so she's stepping aside to make room for the next generation\nY feel like I'm you and I have talked um countless times about medical and some of the challenges and calling her times embattled I mean she and her government has been in trouble since she was welcoming refugees to Germany in large numbers back in\nTwenty Fifteen rights away the wise why we arrive at this moment now with different well there's been a

if you will\nTry and she's been so central to European politics it's hard to imagine European politics without her I mean what what is the reaction so far this this is\nWell the ah the stocks have gone down I mean this is something that's definitely going to send a a very strong ripple effect across Europe people or are they knew this was coming but again she had never announced that until today so this is going to make it very difficult for Brussels for example to push through a its plans to try and integrate the union more\nUh this is probably not going to help the the breakfast situation does negotiate that are going on I mean she is the strongest leader there and she's also been someone who's helped forge consensus and she's in an incredibly weaken position now even though technically what she's saying is this isn't going to happen until twenty Twenty one you know she's not going to seek reelection until in twenty Twenty one and that she's\nBasically go to remain in power until uh until then but it and she's a lame duck at this point\nIn any talk of who are likely successor might be\nWell even though she hasn't really said who is she wants on what what political

charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patients being left with to pay out of pocket so the mass scale doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she

nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level but you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital system in the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think\n... look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy tests\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the piece that that thirty five dollars per se is normal in the bay area\nWell in other places they might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks

talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here I think\nTo democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you government Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they get in for the restoration of
