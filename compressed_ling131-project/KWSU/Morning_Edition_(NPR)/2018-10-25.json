some of yesterday's\nDramatic losses when Wall Street opens this morning most Asian markets were down overnight the Nikkei hang saying but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable which was unexpected because\nChina's stock market has fallen thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob\nLearning to well I was thirty percent drop for China stock market sounds pretty darned bad what's going on\n[noise] we'll try this kind of me has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble and through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from\nAn economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflect that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have as big an impact on the economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans\nAre invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nLet me ask you about China's currency the UN is edits weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\nWell it's interesting hearing well is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast China is doing a\nSo if China should get out of the way and start managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these tests that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chain to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out text\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes block chain that technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about ... but at the recent global climate action summit and San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers people were talking about how he can help mitigate climate change in all sorts of\nLand agriculture\nOil to frustration\nOur sometime in ... climate change coalition he came to the conferences spread awareness about ... [noise] so what does\nThat change or distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology [noise]\nOkay [noise] think of it like the ... is like\nAn accounting book everyone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank but instead on the computers of everyone on the block chain\nTransparency as its main advantage ... tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to ending human trafficking and now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate\nAnd he called ... nor is a black chained based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credits systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let the amendment more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nAnd then the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley jak wish it was that easy because a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those\nIs that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution\nThat things that takes climate change are going to be really hard\nLike getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars to pollute the call I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot news things at either proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and started talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBlushing could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt doesn't say Ken kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem from the Neshoba ...\nWith the clock ticking on climate change max and there's no time to waste sorting facts from [noise]\nFor NPR News I'm Sam [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nThe Democratic nominee for governor in Illinois have contributed more money to his own campaign any any other candidate in history and the owners don't\nReally isn't for them any more money in Illinois politics classical latest on suspicious packages prominent Democrat this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News I'm\nTrying to turn all things considered later today with Tom cocaine heroin in ... it's five twenty nine I'm sue Enron now laugh and is that faith in a moment including reach known in [noise]\nMy kids ask questions all the time some may even be a little pet for you to answer but there is help from real scientists kids can ask Dr universe about science history geography health and just about anything that makes them Syria half dot the universe it ended up the U.

New York has found three people guilty of fraud\nThey were convicted yesterday of paying tens of thousands of dollars to the families of top flight basketball recruits one of those convicted James

Rick Pitino was forced out of a job over all this but he was not even brought on trial\nNow joining us to talk about this case and what the NC double a can do to clean up corruption and college athletics is Washington Post sports commentator Kevin Blackistone also a familiar voice on our program Heather Kevin hey how're you doing to I'm good thank you so what does all this mean for college basketball as a whole what happened yesterday you know I'm not sure I mean\nAnything for college basketball um in in total because what happened here was a pretty isolated incident um but what it does is it exposes the recruiting practices have been going on in a big time college athletics and football and particularly in basketball\nFor as long as I can remember and that is basically channeling of money from a one source\nUm to the families of talent um to ensure that that talent goes to a particular school\nAnd what has happened over the years that the uh manufacturers of of basketball shoes Adidas a Nike or those those uh operations\nHas gotten people in the middle of them um to help transfer that money so that will surprise here is that in his men criminalize or by the federal government as opposed to be policed by uh the NC double A. is and it's been done for years\nAnd it used to be that the worst thing that would happen in this situation is that a someone would be banned from the NC double a coach who was who was caught um funneling money or or some middle man now\nBehind bars which is uh what these are the three men are facing\nWhat you have these three men facing that you'd say um but I Wonder your colleague at the Washington Post Sally Jenkins ruined recently that the real defended here should be a university but the universities are actually considered victims and all of this did you say at the same way that she does\nI I don't see it that way but that was the way that the federal government decided to get involved in is basically they said that the ... universes were being defrauded 'em by the system\nOr because by funneling this money um two players are are players families um these people knew that they were making these players in eligible\nUnder NC double a rules and therefore that at some point\nIt would all be found out and they wouldn't be allowed to play to the university that he'd given them scholarships and therefore they had to fraud at the University of of value which is that a very strange thing to me because I still don't know\nHow that's fraud I mean universities or the University of basketball programs than football programs are still going to get these talented players under they're very um a low level of remuneration a for athletic talented brings them um tend to a million dollars in revenue every year\nWhich speaks to what you said if there's something that uh this is just a drop in the bucket in terms of potential real change here it really is Kevin Blackistone sports columnist for the

a rough day yesterday the Dow was trading up about point eight percent this hour\nBut I don't think the market volatility we've been seeing in the past couple of weeks is not over NPR's Yuki Noguchi joins us now to discuss some of these markets swings can morning Yuki good morning I'm\nAlready so many choppy October yesterday markets closed down and the Dow innocent pie basically erased all their gains for the year what has been going on\nIt's because investors are conflicted and one of their biggest underlying concerns is the global economy you know how the trade war will play out and how higher terrorists might affect it might affect U.S companies\nAre you're starting to see some of that already a caterpillar which makes farm equipment and\nThree am which is a huge conglomerate that makes everything from sponges to car parts ah this we talked about how that starting to affect their bottom line now on the plus side the economy and labor market are and have been chugging along so there are no clear indications that that's going to hit a wall\nOr some companies are beating expectations\nAnd although interest rates are heading up there still historically low\nAll right so some good factors some bad factors one of those sectors that's been hardest hit in recent days if the tech sector yesterday the NASDAQ which is made up all of a lot of tech stocks I had one of the worst days in seven years and this morning we should say it is trading up but what is going on in the technology sector [noise]\nApple this summer or you might recall became the first company to reach a trillion dollars in market value so basically textbooks have already risen very high end of a lot further to fall on and when you have a ... few companies talking as you saw this week about week sales or miss profits\nOn that makes investors nervous but perhaps the stocks are overvalued and tech is a great example actually of how\nThe volatility kind of spreads around the world yesterday you had some us tech firms including Texas Instruments and\nAT and T. reporting some weaker earnings which then prompted you Asian tech stocks including Sony and Sampson to fall overnight\nBut then by the morning you had stronger results out of European tech firms and send U.S companies including Microsoft and Twitter this morning and not helping shore up some of those losses so it kind of good contagion they're eating nerve wracking though to see the markets lose like six hundred points in a day\nAnd analysts say this could continue for a while really quickly why is that it's largely because we don't have clarity on some of the questions that I outlined at the outset where's the global economy headed how much of a trade war it's going to affect companies and until investors feel they have a clearer picture on that\nYou are likely to see strong reactions to any kind of news that could be interpreted as a significant development and we'll get another chance a later today with

participating in cap and trade carbon credits systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment and then the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch\nYou want to make the whole climate change problem just go away\nSo do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was just that easy because the researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those\nIs that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution the things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nThe call I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and started talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nSays blushing could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company has planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block chain will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt doesn't say can kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place a solution that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something as horrible\nA clock ticking on climate change democracy there is no time to waste sorting facts from
