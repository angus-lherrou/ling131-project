bitter in case there was an emergency and mad is when she found a gecko on the touch screen of an office phone making outgoing\nCalls by tapping its feet some joke that the gecko was telling everyone in the recent call history he could save the money on car insurance It's MORNING edition and this is northwest public broadcasting\nKeeping the Columbia River safe is at the core several public meetings scheduled for Seattle and Portland next week and it all has to do with the decisions being made hundreds of miles away and the deserted Hanford correspondent and it came tackled this question how do you keep a mostly empty radioactive waste tanks safe\nFor hundreds thousands even a million years\nFifty six million gallons of radioactive waste and Hanford it's stored in aging underground tanks from World war two and the Cold War\nIt's all not far from the Columbia River these waste tanks that Hanford are huge some of them could fit a three storey house inside there are a hundred and Seventy seven tanks altogether and most of them are single shelves or have a single whole\nMany of these tanks have leaked radioactive waste into the soil like at least a million gallons worth but some the federal government has been able to pretty much empty transferring the waste into slightly sturdier tanks\nSo now the question is how can the feds close these emptied out tanks for the long haul like keep them safe for thousands of years\nHere's the federal government's plan fill up the empty tanks with route and build a rain proof cap over them to protect them from moisture\nIdea is if you keep the water away the remaining waste we'll just sit there and won't move\nThe only problem the board is very concerned about the level of contamination that will remain on the site that Susan ... the chair of the Hanford advisory board the hand as it's\nAnd vice let's spend says when the federal government cleans out those tanks they aren't that clean really there will be about Seventy thousand gallons of waste laughed and just one group of tanks called the sea from\nThe federal government wants to crowd over that and we're also concerned about the fact that we're not sure that ... they put in there will actually mixed with the waste and become a solid impenetrable waste for him\nSo that it won't leak in to the water table Oregon and Washington state officials are also worried they say the federal government is looking at to narrow slice of Hanford when it calculates its total chemical and radioactive waste risk to the Columbia River\nThe states in the feds are counting all the other ways to Hanford like the stuff that leaked out of the tanks already\nAnd other scary waste sites like pets or the government just used to pour radioactive liquids into the desert and all of that waste has created plumes of contamination that continually move toward the aquifer in Columbia River that's the total load\nIf you leave waste behind on site you weren't adding to that eventual burden on the ground water under Hanford and ultimately the Columbia River\nThat's just bright he helps watch over Hanford clean up for the state of Oregon and the state is very invested in what happens at hand for an answer the Columbia\nAnother issue grounding is a really permanent and measure its like concrete it's likely those massive blocks would remain in place maybe forever or at least for thousands of years hundreds of generations from now that's how long it would take for the radioactive waste to cool down from\nOregon's bright says it's really hard to plan for a million years of climate change civilization change and things we just don't know\nThere are the things we know and then to borrow from Donald Rumsfeld there are the unknown unknowns that we need to make sure we're managing overtime\nThis decision is important what's done at the farm might be the template for all the other tank farms of Hanford on a scale of a million years bright says it's the things we don't
