from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin good morning President Trump has jumped back into the fight over his Supreme Court nominee at a rally last night in Mississippi he outright mocked the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford who is accused nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault\nI was wondering how did you get home I don't remember how did you remember when I don't remember\nEarlier in the day in front of reporters the president worried aloud about the upshot of the Kavanaugh hearings\nVery very young men and do what do you feel you're dropping but you may not be guilty of\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell says he plans a vote of the full Senate this week on the Kavanaugh's nomination NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell is in the studio with us this morning I Can't pay their\nSo President Trump clearly believes that politicizing the Kavanaugh hearing is a good idea based on his comments last night to Republican leaders agree Republican leaders are still trying to convince undecided Republicans and even some Democrats to vote for Kavanaugh and this\nKind of conversation is kind of the exact opposite of what they are trying to do and I think she'll probably also point out that the president has made clear that he takes this personally that he and he has a personal connection with allegations and he says what he believes to be false allegations of sexual misconduct and that is playing a role in the way that he's responding\nTo all of this and Republicans it took great pains to not criticized Christine Blasey Ford even going so far as to say she's credible right\nThey have gone they're gone out of their way to create a paper trail and to kind of make\nThe case that they are listening to forward and they're going through all of the appropriate steps of having the FBI investigation supplemental investigation into these accusations so that they can say that this isn't political but I talked to a lot of senators who worry that the concept and the conversation about sexual assault is becoming political as a result of this hearing\nOne of those people was Bob Corker who's retiring bombs from Tennessee Republican he's clashed with the president in the past but he seems pretty uncomfortable and this is what he said\nI Know a lot about sexual\nAssault that we don't care about that is ridiculous\nThat's the way of saying for trade and and\nYou know it's a shame now that was part of a longer more extended conversation with Corker about his real fears that this is a moment that will be hard to come back from

you know from the vent decision be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winners presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate to an athlete and you know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test tube basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic in trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold appalled that a quote somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display use of the virus\nBodies that is what Gregory Winter dad he took phage display and applied it to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know developed enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved in two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease\nSo you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer we heard yesterday from a NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel Z\nOr ... or actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular price to yeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean Francis Arnold is only the fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years\nUm the prize can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people

difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in that case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom Trump blaze said you could do an actual criminal investigation and the case that just Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but that doesn't mean

Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep let's recall the Supreme Court battle before the one we're living through no judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week\nThem federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork America there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork\nThe Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that it's being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics at the government work hike okay I see here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee fell to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process and that and how does it affect their legacy or not well\nOut of a hundred and sixty three nominations the presidents of center the Senate hundred and twenty five uh been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo always telling me that it's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they're just go right\nOnly about a dozen have been rejected but the first\nWas in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain and then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas after chief also failed in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected fence Rutledge\nBut by the way he was also the first appeared before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of her question was interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like this\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resign from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after\nWork a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because he had to legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until he took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that causes it to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you're moving Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted him off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him up\nSo this nastiness it's hardly knew um but then the Senate failed to go along and that pretty much ended the idea of removing adjusted for political reasons and\nThat leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth or Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now\nIs so what was the result or whatever with these lifetime appointment swell lots of judicial plans and various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age summit boat\nA there been talk of an Eighteen year term limits were Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere\nThat would require a change in the law or the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much thank you it's commentator Cokie Roberts and you can ask Cokie your questions about our politics with the government

directly to the public\nBut this is where Dr redlin or has some qualms especially says when it comes to this president\nWe showed her to think that the president might be using such as for political purposes or to create a diversion itself the presidency was under threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real shot I it'd be so one thing about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing of the system known as wireless emergency alerts or W E bay\nThe suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nThey say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes and it wants to turn people cell phone\nBaseless background briefing for reporters a senior FEMA official conceded while there is no opting out of the alert system is very well governed and you would not have a situation where the president would just wake up one morning as the official put it\nAn attempt to send a personal message and besides has Twitter for that Brian

healthcare and science and technology leadership brown dot edu slash NPR and from Americans for the art\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm students get and I'm Rachel Martin it is Nobel Prize week so far no bells have been handed out for physics and medicine and today's chemistry the royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the winters in Stockholm\nComing up you have to go talk to me and how does all this stuff up to ... to let you go north from the vent D.C shouldn't be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winters presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate to ask you to know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the word is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia\nAnd Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her\nSo the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution\nAnd so basically the idea is they took the principles of Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test tube basically you know developing new types of chemicals and enzymes by inserting elements\nYou know using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold appalled that a quote somewhat arrogant approach and so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve the performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it\nAnd then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses the virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and applied to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness and too important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved in two thousand and two and it targets a rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease\nSo you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer we heard yesterday from of NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel\nAre ... are actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular press two yeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean Francis Arnold is only a fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years\nI'm surprised can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know it's a little bit um archaic in this day and age but I think they're trying to keep up I NPR's\nNell Greenfieldboyce with the news that the Nobel Prize for chemistry thanks so much
