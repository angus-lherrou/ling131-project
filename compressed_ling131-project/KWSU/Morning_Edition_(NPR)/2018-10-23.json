put in the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage their relations for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nThey will have great influence in drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group tried to give Democrats influence after twenty Twenty one of the problem that your tried to address\nOh we're trying to deal with a problem a partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering or we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got\nIn the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to represent the the people\nLet's be blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that is slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focused building up their bench\nNo I don't think I Would criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state\nTo make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table and twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty eight team the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen if it will be serving for your terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that we want to have one twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing\nAnd the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a hundred for over thirty million dollars and we are distributing the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting lens so governors always matter\nA state legislators matter but in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor or the state secretary of state um they matter in certain places um Supreme Court justices will matter so in North Carolina we're supporting and eat earls or who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so\nHard for Rebecca ... who won he Wisconsin Supreme courts he\nArgued campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you look at the the the laws as they have\nBeen written look at our constitution as it has been written look at the state constitution says they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally a ... and I think ensure a a a fair process\nOne other thing attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech major mature ripped off a famous remark by Michelle Obama when\nThey go low [noise] they\nGo low we did what did you mean what I meant ... ... ... ... in that remark was that uh\nSee that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that and all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that is something to be expressed through votes through protest through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate\n[noise] well I certainly think votes through protests um I I must say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them\nLawmakers in Indian restaurants going to go into their homes um you know I I'd be going after them I'm at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out today after the Trump inauguration and it was very powerful when young people marched here\nIn Washington to ask for more I sing gun safety measures\nThose are the kinds of ways I think in which the people should or should express themselves\nAttorney general holder thanks so much and I think you [noise]\nAll right Steve the negative millions lottery it's up to one point six billion dollar billion billion with a B they drying

of coworkers together and forming an office pool what about that\nOne in three hundred million is the famous twenty three hundred million um they're both astronomical so the odds are basically the same\nJason curl under the lawyer who represents jackpot winters and he says if your office pool does somehow when that is not necessarily good\nThere could be a lot of problems with office pools\nYeah sometimes not everybody knows who's in the group or an hour which could lead to some awkward conversations if you were to win and that's not all\nLived in Bob where people used to play in a group a long time ago and then somebody wanted a single and then the group went after them said no we were always playing together\nVery awkward but curling is not entirely against office pools\nWell you know I understand why people do it 'cause hey you know you'll feel terrible if your office wins and you didn't contribute just because you didn't like those I Would never say not to

which has been arguing that these laws should be resolved based on internal documents emails memos they've already released for these lawsuits about the citizenship question and not on any questioning of commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\nThe plaintiffs in these lawsuits really want to question how secretary Wilbur Ross because they think that these documents are not sufficient that there have been inconsistencies in a relative's testimony to Congress about why and when he added the citizenship question\nAnd the plaintiffs want to use a deposition uh questioning of Ross in order to get more evidence is law preparation for a trial\nThat is expected to begin on November fifth in New York could be the first trial of the six lawsuits around the country\nAnd at this point the troubled

Court is allowing additional document requests but again we have to see what the administration does next in their next expected requesting Supreme Court and what they asked the Supreme Court to do a before a trial starts\nAnd honestly when can we expect to find out like the the final fate of the citizenship question\nUltimately these this legal battle is expected to be argued in front of the

we want to do is having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw lines that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to represent the people\nLet's be blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat bond that is slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President
