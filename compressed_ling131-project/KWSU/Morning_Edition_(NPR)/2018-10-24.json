Inskeep\nRepublicans want to preserve their power and this fall state elections Democrats want to take some of that power away\nYou know the old in the\nA faith based in front of the midterm elections you know we trained as a candidate would win but we didn't do myself democratic\nChairman Tom for as is working on the Nevada governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning\nFor years Republicans have dominated governors offices in legislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw district lines for future elections Samarra future national leaders according to the Republican overseas his party's efforts\nThere part farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments half\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group is the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWell when you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense so when you have an environment that the historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the ...\nAren't there several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even changed the chamber yes\nYou have a one seat majorities in Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and the number of other states are quite close further compounding\nAh what you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats change hands ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up on the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys won the dry you got the drawing even though you've lost a lot of ground in the election how much\nAnd so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber one of them being Wisconsin in two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appear to have a big majority in votes and you had Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing of district lines that's where that came from right [noise] well\nI Would raise a couple of points on that first and foremost the system we've designed has to have local representative that people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that a state wide tonal somehow should be apportioned out two representatives either fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level um you've seen Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as it as it relates to a personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful understand their district can advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nView at a wave election in two thousand dead on that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand eight team well\nCertainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if they're a winding up for our wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district that Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win a\nIn local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parts\nInstalling a a a master architect at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue a in a more conservative philosophy wants to just use that power out to the localities That's Matt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee after historic\nFlooding in Austin, Texas that cities one million residents have been told to boil their drinking water most was shelved number

[noise] so you can probably guess what happened\nNext and I'm ...\nPlanning yesterday Maggie Chapman was one of a bunch of shoppers at a supermarket wheeling out bottles of water supply had improving the day before when shells were bear after stores started to limit how many\nBottles people could buy it just inconvenient at this point but I keep thinking about you know just ... that we use water I hadn't even thought about\nWhat kinds of things some restaurants are close to cafes aren't serving so you meet a lot of people desperate for coffee and on a more serious note the city of San Antonio sensible water tank or to help keep the local jail supplied with drinking water and the city of Austin worried about maintaining water pressure in a system\nWe've been providing water for a hundred years is it never happened to us is blowing our mind to\nBreak moved there is is the director of the city's water utility he said after all that silk load water treatment has said he'd system of pipes and reservoirs started to lose pressure\nIf he loses too much pressure that said he won't be able to spray water from hoses to fight fire and water pipes risks getting contaminated as microorganisms sneak into a hole and openings they wouldn't normally access\nThe good news is there is that is that water conservation is working people in Austin or using last more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control is how much water we use we can't control the weather but we can control that aspect of it\nHe says if conservation continues and the weather cooperates things could start returning to normal by this weekend if heavy rain kick up\nMore silt and the river could last day on that [noise] for NPR News I'm mostly shell in Austin [noise]\nAnd this is NPR News\nAnd health care and her family unlike him I'll take on the big drug companies to reduce prices candidates are playing to their voters we are seeing them take on health care more head on in part because\nThe owners are so concerned that health care in the mid term in the afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise] and that's later today with Tom cocaine\nHeroin N.
