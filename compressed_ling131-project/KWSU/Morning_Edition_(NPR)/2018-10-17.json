are still on the street when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's at more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its undercut the mile or hugging incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way the story about about social media on about how you present the ... level really engage with heart but will make people reach into their pocket and think that the individual but taking a small step or making a difference\nSo who is Katie mylar why did she start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who had alone but grown in doing various forms of gift committed to help\nAnd then from there she continued their relationship with the country and she started up a charity first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management gets you\nKnow and ... has been very clear in her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia like an army Macintosh John tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who was fundamental in starting up of disorganization he was he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also being part of the vigilante groups which is a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was doing an adequate it can be abused when these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment girls thought he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie my lawyer and he was using that power\nAccording to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power according to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and and when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nGet Katie minor the founder of the organization now what are you doing [noise]\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail if they switch also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with him but she's conceded in an interview\nBut that same year and twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nSays that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get to\n... recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that but he was a good man\nIraq did she did trial in a hung jury and after that if it were a field that she had HIV rain [noise]\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors that was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports and to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents\nWas many many girls I'm are potentially at risk not as important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually we're going to bring a case they were to be tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlining the peace keeping my other at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization which responsible for that\nSays you know where are your schools were at school so you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even in her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this city that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the Chinese leadership to there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of darkness nation it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nIn Liberia gone out of the organization to operate schools\nWell the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up with an organization like the local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf [noise]\nUm and then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community had the sense of\nA lot of people had a feeling that something's gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has not stopped a full investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case [noise]\nUm and

Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ... she had thousands of social media followers they're my little tell stories about life in West point which in a slum in Liberia's capital\nStories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go on a street selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girls are still on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story before we get\nRight what ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its ... had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts bubble make people reach into their pocket and think that they individually by taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie my other why did she started their organization\nKitty mothers women from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of\nYeah community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on on evangelical internship and then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of non profit management catchy\nNo and kicked him ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start disorganization on the ground in Liberia or an army Macintosh Johnson calico about him [noise]\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of disorganization he was he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing ... it'd be nice girls\nWas heavily involved in the recruitment of girls that he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie my lawyer and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his scope of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he\nHe was doing [noise]\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with him but she's conceded in an interview but that same year in twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife\nWho says that she said something on the lines of you know I told her that she loves the children but she didn't didn't really get that\nMy my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think is rumors but Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves when they said that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested did trial it was a hung jury and after that road field that she had HIV right [noise]\n... was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who have contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also at the court documents and organizations internal documents\nWas many many girls and more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who had super willing to bring a case they will be tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlining the peace ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for that says\nYou know where are your schools were the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this study is that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had from the charities leadership that there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this size you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of darkness nation it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to\nTo sexual abuse within an institution and any other context\nIn Liberia still allowed the organization to operate schools there well the story\nDo you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community you have the sense of\nA lot of people have the feeling that something going wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has not stuff flew investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we had both a process for credit than these organizations have we hold them accountable they're looking into whether they Chevy its policy was was followed and the school\nThat was Finley young for pro public I
