opportunity but that depends on exactly where in America you live it's often said that you can predict the future as as many kids by finding other dip code where they grow up\nAnd online data to all being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are on the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dries chatty has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you were virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but you\nSee that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard\nLaw to improve those thoughts so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program\nIt works a lot like a Google Map you can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income ladder of what are the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of the publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope\nCitizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nFounded moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids\nSo the focus is on helping low performing areas improve Charlotte North Carolina has gotten a head start on this effort back in twenty fourteen shed he and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents\nIf you knew anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\nOphelia ... brown a prominent Charlotte physician says that ranking ran counter to Charlotte image of itself as a thriving banking center with an expanding high tech sector and a city that's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\nOut what surprised that we had done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty so I saw\nWhat she saw was a segregated city where a low income black residents especially face it a little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem the group identified early childhood development\nCollege and career readiness family stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhance upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle and now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at us to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs\nAnd affordable housing so I have that here right now it's just kind of care math median income in Charlotte\nAnd a lot of Williams from the Jedi team is demonstrating the opportunity outlets for a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte and clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward mobility if it's green or blue it has higher opportunity\nFor the outcomes for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank\nBarnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg schools he says the tool has already exceeded his expectations\nI think the key thing that has happened is\nThat the fathers for the Carolinas have brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to\nAct on these data I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration in the community partnership\nEffort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at such field middle school it's located in a majority white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte but assistant principal Eric ... says the ...\nPoint five percent are African American four percent are white\nIt's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student body that's largely minority\nThat's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility James e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced\nFor now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographics you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now but we're in the coming years at a change of started to live life the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThis hedge field neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park Ford says that might surprise some people\nWe may as soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man this social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord said the opportunity ... should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us from making really smart really intentional decision so that twenty Thirty years we could look and say yet that was the right call\nCharlotte is already taking significant steps in that direction\nMecklenburg county which encompasses Charlotte has committed to providing pre K for all children the

discoveries have led to a revolution in cancer treatment\nThe Nobel family how high the to warn the a tooth often a Nobel Prize you all the ... going to James Holmes who ...\nThese two scientists invented a new kind of cancer treatment called immune checkpoint inhibitors with us in the studio to tell us more NPR science correspondent Richard Harris and Richard good morning so who are these two winters\nWell the prices being shared of course by James Allison he's a Seventy year old biologist who's now with the empty Anderson Cancer center in Houston and by ... at Kyoto University in Japan he's Seventy six now you know how some years the Nobel Prize comes as a complete surprise ... not this year these names are on just about everybody shortly\nOK so not such a big shock uh but what exactly did these two scientists do\nWell I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties who was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer so\nThey came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if he could release the brakes may be the immune system would be more effective and attacking cancer and that indeed turned out to be the case his observations led to infect what's been called the revolution in cancer treatment\nIt would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have heard that we've talked about them a fair amount on our air and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers in the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alice and the other scientists who's winning this word ... how do you have any you know that him a hundred and work independently of Jim Allison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules\nAnd ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nWhen example one of these drugs that you may have heard about is a drug called ... nuts that goes on a attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and in some ways they're more effective target\nFascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about cancer care\nWell before the scientist made their discoveries cancer treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and the whole world of immunotherapy is known really the driving force behind drug development these\nDays right I mean we hear a lot about immunotherapy how effective are these new therapy that is what has one really wants to know ...\nAnd that's it and evolving issue in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies a failed\nAnd some people have had remarkable recovery remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint inhibitor to treat melanoma in his recovery was spectacular but it's also the case that they are not the cure for most of the patient to take these drugs\nOf researchers are now working on combinations are combining checkpoint inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy or to improve outcomes\nTo very exciting area of cancer research but clearly there's a lot more to do this is not the end of the ...\nScience correspondents Richard Harris with us Nobel winners thank

host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option\nThese are a niche product always have been\nThat's done badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many is more affordable than other products with them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college\nBut during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days now the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage\n[noise] more than ... eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option instead\nOf remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nWho think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for something\nFind that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage that's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost a little at Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on time\nAnd they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care\nAnd generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that deductible has met people have something called health insurance but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options are look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out\nThe government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people Alison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your health comes from exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening tests

only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard water improve those thoughts so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like a Google Map\nYou can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage

might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood Ford says the opportunity at least should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us to try and make it really

you know how some years the Nobel Prize comes it's a complete surprise but not this year the unions are on just about everybody shortly\nOK so not such a big shock uh but what exactly did these two scientists do well\nI'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties who was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer cells and they came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if he could release the brakes may be the immune system would be more effective in attacks\nCancer treatment it would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have heard now that we've talked about them a fair amount on our air and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers and the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alice and the other scientists who's winning this word touch school how do\nYou have any now that him a hundred work independently of Jim Alison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing and his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one in ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nOne example one of these drugs that you may have heard about is a drug called ... true to nuts that goes on attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and in some ways they're more effective target\nFascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about cancer care\nWell before the scientist made their discoveries cancer treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and the whole world of immunotherapy is now really the driving force behind drug development\nThese days right I mean we hear a lot about him you know therapy how effective are these new therapy that's what everyone really wants to know ...\nAnd that's it and evolving issue in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies a failed\nAnd some people have had remarkable recovery remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint inhibitor to treat melanoma in this recovery was spectacular but it's also the case that they are not the cure for most of the patient to take these drugs\nOf researchers are now working on combinations are combining checkpoint inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy or to improve outcomes\nTo very exciting area of cancer research but clearly there's a lot more to do this is not the end of\nThe story of science correspondents Richard Harris with us Nobel winners thank you so much my pleasure It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep in northwest
