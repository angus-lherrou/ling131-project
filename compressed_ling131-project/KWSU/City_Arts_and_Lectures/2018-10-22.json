I wasn't offered a whole lot of things I didn't turn down a whole lot of things but um I was lucky enough at once I got into the motion picture business which took me a while I'm at least one\nScript would come to me um every year but in most cases they they were something that I was glad to do but then there was some real ... like [noise]\nWhat was I thinking probably I was thinking I needed to earn some money so I had so I had to do it you know like beyond the site and then if you like that\nNo no no\nWell as you write in your wonderful book which I could not recommend more in pieces Sally is new memoir which is ... book you write about\nHow gauge it in the flying not in a way got you branded as a TV I forget it only ran one sees them for it I'm flying on rent for three seasons so you've done for years about kind of work and it took awhile for some folks who say oh she's not just applying digital I mean she can do is\nYou know in my heart I'll always be assigned kitchen\nThree sitcoms series science three TV series by the time I was twenty five years so I was really you know indelibly on they do not call us we'll call you list right up at the top and I'm\nCertainly it in pieces that when the book and the reason I even talk about those I'm curious if my life and that was that the movement of my career I'm is because I needed to look at my own a habitual\nPatterns my own handed down um history that has taken me a lifetime to understand and the beginnings of my work and my uh career worth so much a part of\nMe becoming I'm not an actor but me\nWell I mean it's interesting that a lot of the book I mean why this was not just the standard showbiz memoir a lot of the book is devoted to those early years because as you just as you say it's really it's a it's a coming of age or it's a it's a personal evolution story as much as it is a you know\nA a showbiz more really is not that at all and and we were talking a bit for 'em you set out to write this book not really knowing where it was going you started writing but six seven years ago\nYeah it took me seven years and I I wrote it I'm without really having a notion or a clear idea that I was going to publish that are that I Would have the\nTo publish it um I've ruined it for myself because I needed to find out something that I didn't know and um I\nI I think I had been ... with it you know evolved thing with it for for a long time because I was always taking writing classes at you know you at UCLA Extension\nOr I'm going to writers workshops over like during the weekends and writing things in in little snippets of this would comes flying out of my head\nUm but when my mother passed away I felt an urgency to find something that I didn't know where it was I didn't I had thought I'd done all the things that we're supposed to do I have the conversations we heal the wounds if there were any what's done we did such a good job\nBut something was deeply disquieting and it wasn't that I was just grieving that too but\nPull out all of the pieces and lay him on the table and put them together and see if I could understand a story that he didn't know before and and and to do that I had to learn the craft\nBecause it was in learning the craft of acting that I was really able to find pieces of myself and ... ...\n... one of the things I'm really glad we're able to include is and I'm Glad I got some applause ... the uh the mini series you did in back in Nineteen Seventy six and you say in the ... was the first time you had a glimpse of what it meant to be inside a character\nAnd us there's actually a line in civil about that character being a piece of the ... it's a multiple personalities story so what if you talk a little bit about that moment and how that started to maybe open you up both as an actor and I thought it was a person who's well [noise]\nWell let's see how far back that I have to take back some\nUm my childhood was complicated to say the least and I had developed a kind of mechanism kind of survival mechanism that um when when things got too overwhelming to me I sense pieces of myself\nThat were overwhelmed with emotion and with you know things I didn't understand I sent them what I read in the bed in the book I Would send it outside to tree that I can see\nIt get to see this tree outside the window when times that we're very dangerous and frightening to me as a child eight nine ten eleven twelve and I can I Would watch the tree and it was ... it was a sycamore and the leaves would wrestle it sounded like rushing water\nAnd part of me would be in the room and most of me was out there\nSo I developed this and it wasn't that I was civil I wasn't\nBut I didn't the only time I could feel all connected with all of the parts of myself\nWas when I found a stage when I was twelve years old and all of a sudden I was the person I could hear I think the problem was gone\nI didn't want to be dressed as a ... [noise]\n\nI didn't necessarily want to be running around naked but I didn't want to be done after the\nThe halfway to position [laughter]\nSo I I\nTurned it down and turned it down and my step father came over and said if I if I didn't do it um they had called him and if I didn't do it might never work again\nAnd I went oh really and I got scared so\nWas the beginning of of learning that every time I made a decision because I was scared it it wasn't the right one um [noise] and I felt defeated from day one I uh\nIn sixty six I didn't know what the question was um and maybe I maybe I Would have been all of this would have been bubbling up anyway because I'm becoming a young adult and whatever complicated childhood I had was confusing me and just coming out I don't know\nBut it does it manifest itself and in eating disorders and um you know just didn't I then I then\nI went to a doctor and he put me on diets pills because of that at the time they could do that and they were like this big just straight Dexedrine en route okay now we're\nEverybody says\nOh why did he somebody tell me about that\nBut then when I hands were shaking so bad in a scene that I couldn't lift up a cup of tea in the scene because I looked like I was really not doing well I and I found myself drinking a cup of tea holding this author and the cop together\n[noise] and the the nuns were going that's an interesting way of doing that so\nWas always something that stepped in and stopped me from going down these and you know clips and so one day towards the end of the first year I'm just trying to charge through this\nAnd all of a sudden I'm standing in the mother superior to office and all the other nuns are around one of those normal scenes and all the ... nuns around and we're talking about\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\nAll of a sudden\nI put my hands and my face and I just folded I'd just folded up\nAnd in in my head down in my lab I started whispering please let me go home please let me go home please let me go home and he kept trying trying to stop a voice inside my had said get up get up get up just\nPop up and go well I don't know what that was it was weird [laughter] I couldn't do it I couldn't\nMake myself get up I just sat there saying he's let me go home please let me go home and all of a sudden I felt this arm on his hands you know pull up my arm not not like he was trying to pull me I'm pull my hands away or you know try to talk to me it was it was kind of a\nSupport like pulling me up and I heard this voice not loud but a voice that you didn't argue with say\nAnd she she led me I had my hands doing my face 'cause I was too embarrassed and to see how horrified everybody must have been um ... and she let me towards the big sliding doors that open to the sound stage and I could\nHear the Hong Kong is a thing rolled open\nAnd and she pushed me down I got him some vehicle that I never I never looked at the driver all the way home I was to mortified and then he took me home and I I think I was home the next day I come to work\nLike everybody how are you off you know everything's fine they just ate that hotdog I should have done you know and it\n[noise] and then towards the end of that day Madeline pulled me into the back\nI'm into a dark corner in a corner and the sound stage and stuff to a piece of paper in my hand and she said the address is very close and you can you can come Tuesday after work\nI Will need to there is the actors studio ... do you know what it is and I said well you know\nThinking and not so much that I really know what it was but I kind of heard about it and she said I Will not take no for an answer so I met her there\nAnd it was really um the beginning of a huge change in my life because I could then begin to\nHear myself again 'cause if I could get to the work I Would be All right it was when the war was taken away from me that I began to drown and um and then I started working at least offered very intensely and\nI desperately wanted to learn a craft\nAnd initially he was quite taken with you he was it it seems like another\nYou know of another act of Providence would deliver you're going to but it did not entirely go that way with the stress or did it really didn't it didn't\nWas like he had it all planned out but um he was really I'm I'm a magnificent teacher but he could be a little crops\nHe could be rough and he could be and you know what we would sit in the ... and watch other teams and sometimes you know you you feel the other actors go oh my God oh my God how to recover from that you know when when he would talk to some people and he from the get go\nWith me he was in credibly um supportive and um\nI was one of his you know chosen one or something and um\nSo I and I started eventually when the none was over I thank God I [laughter] I started I'm going\nTo his then the ... Institute was he had and his wife and I had started so that I could work with him more intensely I think it was three times a week they were um just him teaching and doing um extended exercises with just with ... and and it was an extraordinary time\nAnd then one day\nAs I'm also so striving to lose\nMy career on because it's going nowhere unless I make it go somewhere and I told myself that I could never blame the them the them the industry the the the unfairness of it all the the\nThe something it it could never be that if I wasn't worried want it to be it had to be because I wasn't\nGood enough and that's when I got good enough\nThat would just change and it was just you know\nShe forward so slowly and one day I was doing a scene I'm friendly at the Institute and you were supposed to\nUm be generous enough to win another actor asked you to be in a scene with that even though it was something you did not want to do in a million ... million years you just did it anyway and did your best because you were supposed to participate with your fellow students\nAnd I had done that with some and not to sue Daphne to to play in a in a two character play called a whore in the ... player I think it is and of course I was not the horn [noise]\nI was it was supposed to be like the two sides of the same person um and one of them was like the Marilyn Monroe is character and one of them was the none issue carrots [noise] which one she wanted me to fight [noise]\nAnd so automatically I didn't want to do it but I ... you know I was you know we're going to do the best they could and but it was about but I wasn't\nReally taking it seriously and I and by then I was kind of hockey I was kind of shirt myself with lead well you know\nDifferent new fancy footwork here and a little you know a fair and I'll\nBe just you know that's all everybody with that and I'm\nLee first talk\nBut the ... when you work at the actors studio what you after you do a senior supposed to say you know when ... or ... or whoever the moderator is you're supposed to talk about what you were working on because it's never finished product it's always a work in progress secretly working on very specific aspects of a character\nI'm there and sometimes they seem so obscure I ... I Would want to say that the actors were a little more reasonable thing to be working on but what whatever you know um\nAnd he asked my fellow after what he was working on and she said something and he was very he seems very generous and so he turned to me and and before you even ask me what I was working and he says when are you going to stop this [noise]\nAnd it was a huge we went into a huge\nFight 'em ... no one ever talked actively but some things just clicked some some\nJust didn't turn in what's affectionate and so as a child I needed that kind of affection but how terrified\nAnd so the danger was always connected with love from me stumped man he was literally arrest battery so you know it's taken it takes me it's taken me a lifetime to figure out\nHow I can just connect those two because wait a minute that's done those two don't really go together Sally you can still have a relationship with somebody and not feel in danger on the line\n[noise] while the other big figure of course in this in this triangulation is your mother who and what she knew or didn't know during during the course of the Senate and it's very moving the way you write at the end about\nYou're coming to some accommodation with her about that not necessarily a complete it's not all sweetness and light what happens between your mother but you do you love your mother\nDeeply um and then the complex way that the mothers and daughters sometimes is particularly when there's abuse happening I'm the mother knew something but didn't know it all it's it's really quite\nUm it's quite extraordinary and I just I Wonder if if as you were writing it did you know all of these things before you could I mean did you discover knows when the writing\nI discovered in the writing I discovered so much in the writing and it was hard to do is hard to get a it was hard to move away from it became you know addicted to it I'm ... and I\n... you know I Would have it in my pockets and my shoes they had because I didn't want to be away from it and I'd be drawn a way to go to work and do other things which was probably a good idea and I come back and it would be sort of fresh\nBut I I the big ingredients the big things I was looking for I didn't discover until I made myself go back and look at it I made myself read my journals that\nYou know only like Fifteen Years prior to this and I wrote it down it happened I wrote it down and completely ... from my brain and yet something in me knew I needed to write it down and it was only in doing that that I went\nWait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait one minute and went and found a journal and went and got when\nOh my God and\nCould peace some things together that we're in pieces [laughter] um [noise]\nAnd I understand um and I think ultimately what I was looking for was what I felt about my mother um I did not want to feel\nUm that she had left\nAnd ah [noise] um\nThat she wouldn't taught me first I needed to haunt me and then I I thought do I am I feeling angry I don't know\nAnd then ultimately I'm at the very end when I'd done all of this for seven years and I was sitting with my youngest son Sam I'm who is the only one who I'd let read ...\n... actually I Would read it to him as I was putting the last chapter trying to figure out what how it fit together and they said\nFamily did I Do all of this what is this a oh what did I learn I've just I've looked for something and I all the time and I still don't know what it was\nAnd he said oh my God I don't see how different you are then you were seven years ago how differently you feel about yourself\nAnd I\nWent oh God\nYes you're right I Do and that really is the end of the book it's the last understanding of it that I write I'm about my mother and um\n[noise] I realized that they didn't need her to haunt me uh I'm fine without her and that\nSomeday she will come and get me [noise]\nLet me just switch gears old them ask you about some of the people that you've worked with over the years when you're close to what you mentioned Joanne Woodward and so yes talk a little bit about what the I mean it's such a [noise] the two of you it's just ... yeah and I was just really mark will tell me about working with with her on on the well\nShe um and I was lucky enough to later work with her fence phenomenal husband Paul I mean they were this this\nThey um she was a real actor that's really all she cared about she never cared about you know being famous or looking really pretty or she just wanted to work get me to the work and she boy did she know how to work\nAnd she was just dead on and there was no um there was no ego involved it was always about the scene and um I've been lucky enough to work with a few people like that\nBut um I think Joanne Joanne really was the first and um you know she just was one of the few people in my life really you know sit here take my hand I got it\nShe just was at a gym now you do in ... in in ... it's really is a great or it's just a great\nYou know this Jewish classic Jewish guy from New York and and the character that you play that there's real chemistry is a sort of a cliche but there's something more than ... physics storm Audrey me to do if you what what was it like working with with him when\nHe was you know he's again a wonderful guy and a wonderful actor\nBut I think the chemistry that you see between run and I it's really I'm already written I ... um and what can you know played through Ron I'm because ... was came into my life than it was such a huge influence in my life from then on um\n[noise] and so it's it's interesting um that\nHe's so I'm ... wrap himself around a ... a performance and and um and a production but he's never eaten it doesn't take over it or anything but\nUm I think the the Enron and I really loved working with each other but\nI was seeing Marty when I Lived in Iran um my how I adored him\nWas was he the most influential director for you what you say\nI guess you know absolutely no evidence even though I've been lucky enough to work with some wonderful directors but he it was the role in and how we and how he um enabled me and he had come from the actors studio\nAnd and I'm the same way that you know they he he was close friends with Lee and\n... van and all that and he had a language that I understood and I didn't have to decipher his language to into my own um\nTo to play chess games with each other and see if we get out maneuver each other you know and um I don't know that I ever really quite\nAgain ... ...\n[noise] uh when Lincoln the possible of Lincoln came up you that determination as you've been talking about really went into high gear you are determined to get that part and originally Liam Neeson was\nWas cast in the role and you went after you've really lobbying Spielberg that you wanted to play this role and it looked like it might slip out of your hands on by God you weren't going to let it happen so you are you sort of pretty much insisted on it for him I'm Daniel\nDay Lewis of course famously you know stays in character ... what was it like\nFor you working with that with remarkable actor who has that particular well see\nI ... I left that I mean that's perfect for me I left that um I Would you know in my own little way um I always stay in character but I Would always hide it because I never felt I had the power to be\nDaniel Day Lewis and to take over and say everybody's got to follow these rules you know and\nSo everybody follow the rolls around ... character but he lives alone [noise]\nUm and you know and and and I and he's he's a phenomenal guy um but he he made it so that when we came on the SAT\nThere were no cruel around it was all set up so you didn't you didn't ever 'em ramble\nIn in in ... and and and feel the contemporary world around you you know the crew wasn't allowed to come up and said you see that television thing unless I never you were just in this world\nOf the White House and I'm ... and Daniel sort of demanded that he and Steven it's decided that and and um\nThat's what everybody else in the cast conform to that\nThey did a lot of a lot of actors but complain they complained to me I don't think they combine to Danielle and it was all I can I can wear my tennis shoes on the phone [laughter] you know [laughter] but I\nJust loved it I mean that's there it is that said that is the you know the the totality of it how deep we can you commit to this to being this other character and I love the fact that he does that what\nWas it a little more like stage acting because the crew was sort of kept at a distance that was there a sense of what's or the ... to being on the ... with a different way or another they're they're they're certainly", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "22"}
