[noise]\nAnd [noise]\nYou know Kevin voice or as a regular guest on the daily and when he's not a guest on the daily which feels like a lot um you are calling us at the time as you were a writer at large at the New York times magazine and\nHow do you describe your ...\nAh I cover like the worst people on the Internet [noise]\nLike I don't know I I feel like I'm you know unlike dirty jobs when they have those guys who like put on wet suits and dive down into the tanks of sewage unplug the sewers [laughter] so I got to me but like on a computer [laughter]\nUm [laughter] but on a computer um and\nThe funny thing about you people don't know is it before you were even a columnist before even got at the time he wrote two books and the first of those books have like a pretty wild premise and I want to remind people about what that was [noise]\nYes so when I was in college I uh didn't sign up for a study abroad program instead I went um undercover at Jerry Falwell Liberty University\nAny uh and the other one does any liberty alumni out there\nThat I didn't I didn't think so um [noise] ah\nAnyway so I don't know you're not even jealous no no no no I I grew up in a sort of very liberal Quaker House and I'm not the oatmeal Nazi oatmeal we get a lot of that your your ah your understanding of their duty or um [noise]\nBut I I wanted to experience life on the other side and see this was during the tail end of the Bush years um the George W. Bush and I wanted to kind of see what the religious right was doing now obviously liberty is like you know Trump gave the commencement address there last year it's become sort of a big\nUm Republican or operatives machine um but back then it was still run by the senior Jerry Falwell who's since died and it was it was uh\nAnd singing and the church choir and things like that and how undercover worry people now that you were writing a book no no I I transferred there as if I was like you know just a student and I I I went to to brown which is sort of like the opposite of of\nThe book was called like from from from brown to liberty yeah it ... it was like um which which actually they had a very funny reaction to the liberty 'cause like I said they would say where'd you come from and I would say\nThat you know I I went to brown and they said my God I'm so sorry [laughter] it must be awful there how do you how did you do that they have seemed I was like an evangelical trapped\nI'm so we had fun in a liberal you want you to college with ... yeah um then you've got around to that one [noise]\nUm [noise] I'm In San Francisco do I mean these schools are lifted applause [laughter]\nYes yes\nFeeling it started to start to feel the me going back and looking at your resume that at the idea of ... of of putting yourself in a sort of ... to you at least an exotic world and just kind of bearing herself and it is you're calling card and the most recent version of that\nAs as listeners the daily now has been immersing herself profoundly in building the darkest corners of the Web I mean as you said you're a beat is kind of prefer perversion of on the Internet\nYou know I'm I'm interested in extremes I'm interested in people who choose to live very differently than I Do and um and part of what we've seen happen over the past several years is that the Internet and social media has has really given voice to extremist and I'm I'm very interested in how that happens\nAnd what kinds of things they choose to do and where they congregate so I'm I have you know every day I wake up and I turned on my computer and I I have like a whole running list of like awful for Chan a sub board than reading threads that I'd check and then I check my email after that [laughter]\nAfter you take a shot back I mean I wasn't even why we put together this particular cast of characters on stage and it's because we're very much want to do is to blame the essential elements of what it is to make the daily and so here on stage tonight you have the three ... atomic elements of the show you have\nYour dashing host may [noise]\nUm [noise] you have [noise]\n\nUm\nYou have your ear you're in trouble\nUm [noise] and\nAnd and forget that we're going to draw back the curtain on on of course the tech industry but also how ... how we make the daily and the reality is that when you drop back the curtain on the daily it's not always so perfect and highly produced or even pretty\nAnd I say that because you may remember this if you listen to the first couple of weeks of the show I don't come from the world of audio I don't I have no experience with a little audio\nI mean in reality I Do not deserve to be an audio ... I did not come from the world I'm not one of you and um [noise] and when the show started I encountered a tremendous difficulty actually just doing the work of of being an audio host my voice was much higher than it is now we can talk about how that changed\nAnd I read audio rip your best in Seattle and I call it um and and I genuinely struggle with just the the basic of like saying we'll be called the billboard of the top of the show from the New York times and today and the and all that stuff and and I could not do it and we would be in the studio for hours yeah trying to make it work [noise]\nIt's yeah it's just so normal I didn't think that would be a joke that but [laughter]\nIt does kind of a story that became kind of like took on mythic quality is on the team whenever someone would joined the team I Would tell them of the night before the daily launched and all the producers were packed in the studio with Michael and we spent an hour trying to get him to say the date with enough ... that it could\nCould you could launch the daily and it would feel like we were taking on this moment with enough ... and we and we spent an hour to each producer trying their hand at at coaching hand like\nJust below words lower land this way and we we actually have\nThe last Fifteen seconds of this of this hour and\nA for you thank you Wednesday February first It's Wednesday anyway it's It's Wednesday February first\nSo they were sort of advocating for just a more so I I'm trying to remember what role does the discord play in the actual\nUnite the Right rally and ultimately I guess the violence that occurred I mean how directly do you feel like a site like this conversation is like those that you're listening to and we just heard and a contributing to what happens there\nWasn't any space where people are able to gather in sort of semi private or private areas is gonna be prone to this I mean it's not I don't think this is disgraceful\nUm but I think after that after our story ran after the the podcast came out they didn't crack down on these guys and and ban a lot of the biggest for clusters of extremists from the server since then you know it's more popped up but they're keeping a closer eye on it now and you ended up interviewing\nPeople in this group in this disorder but yeah I I called up\nAnd I was at the rally and he's a big Internet I'm All right presents and um yeah we had a very interesting conversation\nI Want to play this clip of you're talking to the white nationalist because I think it does something really important in explaining why we created the daily and why the show is what it is which is\nIt creates a real transparency around reporting and storytelling and one of the things we don't talk about on the show is kind of how much the show is guided by what happened in the presidential election and the feeling that a lot of it had on a few hundred I definitely had that\nJournalism is kind of failed us twenty sixteen and we had arrived at a point where\nReaders justify Li like didn't understand how we were getting our information and fell a little misled about the conclusions that that that they had drawn because of the reporting we did and and the daily is all about many listeners really understand how journalism half\nOf what it's like to be on the phone with somebody what it's like when Dianne Feinstein answers the phone or\nIn this case a white nationalist interrogate you and and I want to play that because I think it helps people understand what journals and actually sounds like [noise]\nHow do you want to ask you a question you sort of stopped and said well can I ask you a question for the personal [noise] what race are you [noise]\nThe you stand my profile look Hispanic them and\nI'm not as [noise] oh you're white or Jewish was the question [noise] well if you're white than a than a few years there'll be part of this group [noise] okay All right how's it going to\nMean basically basically trying to ... you end up saying something ... and this was like the kind of story that would never that that would never make it into a print version probably but that we would I Would ... you know my colleagues at the bar or that would come up in conversation I I Love that about\nIt sort of what the reporter's notebook element of the day and that's what's so fun as we get to write are straight for the paper and then bring all of the kind of extra material in and make it you know come alive in audio\nAnd we only have that clip because he was actually recordings you so I think it's important to understand that it wasn't like you were recording conversations necessarily fear it I think you were doing some kind of fact checking with him and it's kind of thing\nNo and I this is sort of crazy to me that like you are in in your regular reporting life\nAre find yourself in these kinds of there'll be trap where your sources are trying to cap CEO or or like corner you know so that you say something that could potentially be damning for your career\nYeah and I always have to be on the lookout for that I mean are there are a lot of people with strong feelings about the New York times positively or negatively and we've we've learned that you know there are people who will try to plant false stories who will try to trick us we'll try to catch us doing something so it's just it just makes you more cautious and the reporter I think\nI Wonder how much time you spend thinking about the dangers of amplifying this kind of journalism I mean you send your day in this world\nAnd then you write about it and then you come on a daily and we're all collectively putting a lot of energy and time and print and audio into essentially giving these people need to be a bigger platform and I wonder how you travel with\nYeah it's something that I think about a lot and I obviously you know we don't want to be a megaphone for people with extreme or sort of dangerous views on the other hand I'm\nAs with this court like a lot of times are reporting on this is the thing that brings the existence of these communities into people's awareness\nAnd in some cases actually leave the platforms themselves to kind of crack down on them so even though we may be amplifying like one specific set of people it can lead to you know major overhaul and change it at these platforms which can then sort of like\nIt'd be a net good more the quality of the conversation but I also think like that's kind of I when I get to watch a lot like how can you amplify\nThings like Q A non or things that might remain on the fringes\nAnd I guess my answer is that these people have platforms I mean there there are people like Alex Jones and others have enormous\nInternet platforms they they sort of um you know sometimes they're bigger than ours and so I think in that case we can sort of service like a translator or a corrective interest explaining to people sort of what's happening who's involved and what um what the nature of the conversation is\nHow how much did a\nSites like Facebook Twitter you to how much of a rule that they play in taking what you are experiencing underscored\nPermission and hate speech and sort of extremist content moves through the Internet there's like sort of a well established\nPath for it goes from like you know this quarter for channel that goes to read it and that goes to Twitter and then it goes to Facebook and YouTube\nUm so that's pretty familiar I think that ... ... right now what some of these companies are grappling with this kind of like how do we interrupt that chain\nOr like how do we make it so that the stuff doesn't I'm getting millions of eyeballs on it but it's hard great like these people are crafting a few shut them down one place they move to another place I'm with a different name so a lot of the servers that that got deleted from discord after Charlottesville are now back up with with other names\nUm and if you're part of the kind of like a whack a mole game it's it's pretty much sort of it's hard to win where are these guys now [noise]\nUm they some of them are are still on to score they've also moved into um groups on what's that they've moved in to um they moved down to read it they're they're sort of spread out a little more than they used to be outside of centralized where you have five thousand people in one group but they have sort of smaller pockets of that\nAnd one of the things you've done so well on a daily is explain how much accountability or non accountability\nHas occurred when it comes to the big social media companies that have been number comes from both burdened by that and in some people's minds complicit in its amplification so\nYou kind of made a sub beat it and your job of explaining to the world what Facebook\nEspecially has been doing when it comes to this and\nMy favorite episodes of the daily and I never expected them to be even listen I'm all\nFor the congressional hearing involving or something yeah those are fun they didn't want a lot of stuff I don't even watch all five hours of it but you\nPeople don't watch congressional hearing like I like I I'm not a I Would not news before the daily and you I wouldn't have dreamed of wanting to watch a congressional hearing and I think one of the things that is so powerful that like you as a as a narrator on the daily is that\nYou can make it fun in a way that like I'm sort of I I can be can be tricked into watch into watching a congressional hearing [noise]\nAnd and and and this hearing just the context to remember what happened was they took it was going to be this\nThis moment where we were going to have\nA we were going to have Congress really holding\nBut the but this moment where they they could really they could ask Mark Zuckerberg anything and it was going to like we're all sort of waiting to see what it would be and you as a narrator was so fun 'cause we saw\nI'll just let you hear it and therefore you consider mud personally identifiable date on the companies do not mind is that is [noise]\nNo senator actually the first line of our terms of service say that you control in on the information and content that you put on Facebook\nAnd so it felt a little like a five hour tech support call\n[laughter] don't like trying to explain to someone very patiently how their iPhone weren't\nWhat to do if it's on the fringe there will always be a version of Facebook got his ... is our mission to try to help connect everyone around the world to bring the world closer together in order to do that we believe that when you talk for a service that everyone can afford and we're committed to doing it on our\nDoes turn the dial on on sort of that kind of viral contests that actually having a little bit harder time these days and getting the kind of audience that they once had and they're starting to experiment with other types of stories\nBecause of the outrage machine doesn't work as quite as well as they used to\nI'm\nKevin has been a very serious discussion it's been kind of heavy most daily discussions are kind of heavy Patty and I think before we even think about\nTurning to our saviors in the audience for you and I we want to have lightened things up just to touch the patch [noise]\nOne of the things about making a new show with a new host to hasn't been an audio is that you learn their verbal and as I'm sure you on now Michael ... has a pretty recognizable verbal attack\n[noise]\nThat comes in any form it's a it's quite polarizing people feel many different ways about it you guys get like a lot of emails about the ... yeah [noise]\nWe do we get at least one or two a week about the ...\nI have a pretty I have a somewhat of noxious reply to the people who don't like it would you like type ... H\nM M M M M M\nIt's not just at the producer that you've done that email every time feels like you're saying the same joke over and over again\nSo work I used to sell the ring tone though like you know [laughter]\nAnd what's interesting about it in ... it's like oh you are to kill it and why this weird take I have I mean let's talk about why I actually do the right which is um when you're a journalist and you're on the phone with somebody and they're they're just sort of drawing on and on or saying wonderful thing\nThere aren't that many ways of affirming them or\nMaking them think you're still listening [noise]\nYou can do a lot of things without agreeing thing you can just\nYou've been talking with your mother ... [noise]\nReally more about the fact that it's about it's about the fact that you can be talking to someone that you don't agree with you and they can be saying something that you don't want to affirm but you want to say I hear you and you want the audience you know they are still there\nAnd the and I think a lot of say right yeah yeah and when we talk to people but saying that sounds like you're actually two white nationalist do I sound like you're a Birmingham I I feel\nVery firm personally when I go on that when I go to the daily I mean it's like a better now are the guys you make me sound very far it's just an hour yeah and and and I get a lot of affirming ... and I feel like I honestly I shouldn't be like paying your co pay for [laughter]\nA good experience I I Hope everyone in the through Sunday had the chance to be affirmed by these guys [noise]\nOpen ... there was something that any brown you Mays yeah waiting to them yes and we're wondering if anyone's birthday tonight\nThey British\nYesterday that's pretty good okay this one for you we have a birthday\n[noise]\n\nSo uh\n[noise] if there is an explanation it was my birthday it was every day and anti brown made [noise] well\nI didn't have to change any of the pictures of the [noise]\nYou just\nIn the right pitches it's I just took one interview and took all the ... I keep that one out of\nThe good\nYou know [laughter]\nIn the in the drop box but it's just like a folder of now there is no there is now there is but I I loved ones are like\n... [noise]\nMy favorite [noise]\nAnd I'm not no way we're going to turn to you and I\nWe are and before we do that I Want to thank you both coming all the way out here to be\n\n[noise] I've come to life and the question [noise]\nHi I'm just kind of\nWorked well with the last question I was wondering when you described a slow news day what if a lot is happening in the world and I love how you do the same thing where you're like here's where else what else happens today how do you prioritize what story you tell on any given day so in the morning so a number of the team goes to\nThe nine thirty which is also called the front page meeting where they discuss what is coming that day I'm what you expect maybe we're expecting someone to resign or expecting this hearing to happen is going to do an announcement owned by the way the science desk has this interesting feature that's coming out\nAnd like the ... and the magazine is going to release this profile\nUm and and we we leave there with like a ... with a rough outline of of of what what we want to cover\nAnd I think when we think about a story that is a daily story I'm at is a is a story for the daily it has to be a news event that you either must on you have to understand something complicated in order to understand what's happening in this moment it's such a development in the mall or investigation that\nWe've you know we're adding a detail to a store we've told a bunch of times we put that in the what we call the headlines at the end of the show\nBut if it's something where you're like oh man this is complicated this changes the way that I understand something or we need to tell the story of this person before we like that so that you can understand the department of education and this new development we will we will devote a show to that\nAnd there are times where we don't want to do it but we have to blow up the show because because Donald Trump was our president because news happens\nAnd and we resist for hours where we're kind of like\nOh no no no no nothing we can make a headline\nAnd this happened this happened a few weeks ago where we were making the series on family separations divided with Caitlin Dickerson end any Corey all\nAnd we had three days planned and we had the the stories were made by ... by two of my colleagues and um and\nAfter the first day there was the the Manafort\nAnd Cohen guilty pleas and and and conviction and we didn't want to cover it because we had this thing planned and a member of the mass had who is one of the most senior editor at the whole newspaper came down to the daily and was like listen [laughter]\nCan't you can't ignore that and we also like you know\nCover yeah and we decided as a rule we would never cover a presidential tweet as an episode because like there's just not enough\n[noise] ah [noise]\nNo I mean if you think about doing special like plot characters suspend morals fish like just like this was in Congress would who would who we are\nBut I Will say that there was a there was the day that that um the whole time it was made we we traveled at the same question of like your comment toll comment with me and they um we were talking about the idea of like how do we do an episode about a sentence\nAnd we all are like now like what are we going to say like it that's rude to bad like just you know it's like it's not that much to say about it until we until we realized that\nThere is like that there was a story that led up to that moment that like\nThere there had been these these two senators from across the aisle who were coming to terms office to\nPresent a bipartisan immigration deal and then out of the wings came all of these immigration hawks who are like super conservative and they were literally weren't walking into the oval office yes\nIn a surprise addition to the to the meeting and and they're with bringing Trump's ear and pulling in a new direction and and these two bipartisan senators are saying no no what about our deal and in this moment he sent this comment and it was in and that was the daily story and we were like okay we got to do it without an episode\nAnd and I I feel like when when we when we can can text July the tweet in that way where like the sweet matters because\nThose were the two thousand\nAre are in the day all the time I Am in the in the here's what else would you to know sense\nYeah yeah so\nI'm so one of my favorite parts of the daily is I'm kind of humanizing aspect\nThat gives to all these reporters that I get to read from it in print but then hearing the voice and things like that it's just a whole different elements I'm my question is how have those reporters who have been featured on the daily um how did they react\nTo that and new form or a new kind of medium of journalism and I know like for some of your here it's created this other level was kind of fame maybe very nice same I'm not sure but\nIt was like family\nI'm Wondering how to reporters react to that and then have the experience some of the same thing is that has that been", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "15"}
