I suppose less that it just putting the reader on trial\nAnd more that it is potentially enabling to read it to be aware of themselves in the process of reading um so it's less a judgment and more of a mirror and um and and that hopefully that is more useful position\nUm for us to scrutinize the suspicion within um in this time when we were told to be so suspicious and face up to the feelings that we tend not to hassle yeah yeah and also and also the ease with which I'm we can have an ... an artist constructed for us so\nI often tell people that you know a a multiple of Britain about looking fundamentalism called it a thriller\nAnd when I'm told this I say yes it's a thriller in which nothing really happened [noise]\nRight and um and the reason why it's a thriller is because we were all pretty thrilled before we began the book\nUm we live in a world that we imagined to be for them and so somebody gives a certain tonality if somebody gives us a few sketched images I'm a certain way of speaking um we conjure fourth yeah or the thriller from within us\nAnd uh and to me that's important because I'm a ... you know\nIt may be that we live in the world that is much less unsafe that when you imagine I'm a and a dollar eagerness to imagine it's an safety is in fact the biggest danger that we that we face from\nThe political situation has given us a tradition in which you an eye on the possessing types may strike fear in the hearts of how will that mean we looked like potential threat\nI mean I I I I'm reminded\nThat guy and I suddenly put on about six inches of hiding\nA hundred pounds of muscle you know and I had to come into the flea threatening a person who must be difficulties screened and occasionally hold off aircraft when they're already on the runway I'm uh in that sense it's quite empowering but um [laughter]\nBut uh you know ah\nYou should be careful what you wish for us [laughter]\nYeah I used to get stiffed fetch Everytime I Pretend to Japan's gonna happen\nTo you dress appropriately and this is the thing that you a certain point you to think how are you going to respond to this you know uh what reading material you carry you know what a a\nYou know what kind of what will you reveal yes um and this I think it's actually a very important because now we live in the world where are we haven't recently we've been told that a\nA agents will have the right to inspect your computer or your mobile phone I'm at the border and such a deeply private things right do you have your your children's photographs you have\nYour love letters you have um pictures of people who passed away you know you're in a most personal life and these places and we're saying that somebody who\nNot because there's some sort of probable cause or court sanctioned a reason but because they simply take a dislike too you can read much about in the ... I'm a suddenly we begin to experience what the consequences of\nUm of this empowerment uh uh this this granting of dangerous power to those who have not asked to be granted that power because they don't perceive themselves as being dangerous [noise]\nUm this empowerment of all of us into potential villains\nA has resulted in a circumstance where we will be forced to censor the way we wish we live our lives we won't be able to carry out children's photographs with us we won't carry 'em I Love letters and we won't carry we'll have a black phone and a blank computer that travels with us\nAnd this is this is just the beginning and if we continue along this line eventually I like people in East Germany in the in the lives of others that wanted to fulfill um we will force to be forced to hide 'em up personal uh approached a lot\nPeople who've liked or retweeted um the piece of information now how'd you get that\nUm the way that human beings are designed is we are designed to privilege and prioritize and give a greater importance to threatening information [noise]\nUm so uh you know if there's a flash of orange behind the trees or we could say well it's probably not a tiger but we're we are designed to say that that might be a tiger because our ancestors who said it probably wasn't the tiger have all been eaten by tigers and\nAnd the genes have not been passed on to us those of us who are left um for the for the basis for\nYour street every day or for a year and a thousand people say hello but the cost of that you you will forget every single one of those fellows but one person who shouts of racist epithet a Jew you might remember for your entire life because that was a hostile frightening potentially threatening thing we privileges that information\nSo then you have a profit making sort of enterprise um that wants to our attention what do we give our intention to we give our attention to threats and\nSo what begins to occur is that we are presented with threats now um it's not that we just open the newspaper and encounter fetch which on the television but not because of our phones we are receiving disinformation about threats on new continuous basis\nThat is fundamentally destabilizing I think to the human organism it has created in this moment the sense that we are so menacing to each other\nUm that uh uh there's no way forward it has a crippling I'm a excess uh addiction um ah to threat perception\nUm which causes us to recoil\nFrom the future because the future is full of threats and would that enables a this recording from the future and pessimism would that enables is a kind of nostalgic politics\nAnd ... politics of spreading all over the world and this politics tells us don't look forward looking back let's make Islam great again you know let's make you know Britain raised again and you know I Believe in America that might be something like that also have um [noise]\nAnd so um and so we are presented with ... let's go back and we cannot do because time does not work in that way [noise] um that's the pernicious environment in which we find ourselves and so when you say you know that we know more about each other\nWe may know more about each other but we certainly are experiencing is a very heightened sense that we are threatening to each other [noise] um and I think that is completely misguided but also self fulfilling\n... there's also the the adoption at the screen and had I been in the car with you and your wife I'd have offered an even more useless suggestion for title\nWhich is the longing or the poignancy of cell phones reading that I thought part of what's going on in your book is that people in Pakistan, India everywhere and seeing images but the promised land and the problem lies the sitting this energy and then finding than others 'cause you think that you can see them that the company can touch them yes\nAdmits precisely right I mean in\nGot to say the ... fleet this city where they live which are descending into terrible violence and the novel obey the laws of physics as we understand them for the most part with one slight exception which is that in the novel these black doors have begun to open\nAnd and he's black and doors um for example the door to a bathroom here in San Francisco or to your closet one day it becomes an opaque black rectangle and if you push yourself to that you find yourself no longer in uh San Francisco but in Kyoto or the whole or or ... or some other place far away\nAnd then people begin to move through these and then ... billions of people move and the next several centuries of migration of code within a year or two [noise]\nUm so as far as cell phones are concerned you know the black doors is supposed to do the magical realism oh this is some you know science fiction um you know perhaps uh but uh I think that the prevalence of these small black doors that we carry with us these little black rectangles which has the screen of our phones [noise]\nUm [noise] and that I except for you pick up I Know it doesn't have one I think almost everyone in this room I'm Will have one of these rectangles black rectangles it in the in the pocket or in the handbag or in their backpack\nOr a on the person I'm and these things called how to us you know like uh the ring calls out to a call them\nYou know my precious and uh it is a seminar tension and we sort of have some of your finger on your phone right now is that in the and the um you know you're experiencing this lord of the rings like a connection and and uh and the anxiety when we don't have a phone\nWith us but what is the phone make possible\nThe phone is a portal through which our consciousness depart from the geographic location about body\nThat is what the phone is when my children send me a video what they've done today um and I look at that video I Am seeing Pakistan and I'm thinking about the whole\nBut equally I could be reading an article about Japan or about India um about a Brazil or about you know efforts to colonize Mars or the\nFictional history of West heroes and I will be in these places\nAnd so um [noise] this is the will of going into and and for me the notion that well if this is what technology is doing is is it is sort of obliterate in a um\nA worthwhile imagining what if I bought this could go through um isn't that where we're sort of headed and and then that enables or what you're talking about this this\nMan except there's so many bad it's not ... and so that pull it off to countries that will never ... yes and as you were saying that well the the [noise]\nUm this is what remains to be seen so the porters are not being created the question is what we do when the people come uh I think it will not be the case that people will choose not to come now that people can see they will come the question is what do we have on the other side of the dome um [noise]\nNow ah I tend to think that human history is over time I'm a journey towards greater equality and so we have seen that I'm In this country a hundred and fifty years ago\nA African American people were ah legally ah deemed to be slaves um\nLess than a century ago women couldn't vote but now we believe that people have would be called different races or which is itself an interesting concept but that's just use that people have different races are equal\nPeople have different genders are equal or people of different or no religious belief should be treated equally gay people in straight people should be treated equally\nUm it seems to me a utterly unsustainable that we should believe in these qualities and we should all the same time say\nI'm the child born in San Francisco and a child born in Sao paolo should have fundamentally different entitlements to where they can live and what kind of life that can enjoy the child in Mogadishu in Milwaukee should have fundamental because of the lottery of where they were born\nOne should stay in a place where they could be killed violently and have nothing to eat and the other should be able to live in a place that is safe and whatever because of what you know what is this principle\nUm and I think that in two or three hundred years to look back\nAt this moment in human history and think that we who prevented a refugees especially the migration um they will think that we are as barbaric as we imagine a slave holders were a hundred and fifty years ago and so um and so this is my view now\nWhen you say that OK well people can move the captain because we're stopping them right or you can move the container full of you know T shirts or from Asia to America for almost nothing you could move ...\n... is that the reason why all of these equality is built on each of the racial equality gender equality sexual orientation religious beliefs et cetera all built on each other is because it is impossible to deny equality and sustain the other qualities as hard to deny one [noise]\nSo what happens is in our process of saying well people are trying to come and we're going to stop them but yet we believe in human equality\nSomething has to give we have to admit that we don't actually believe income inequality and that's a slippery slope because what occurs is we we begin to construct society is capable of keeping migrants out\nThat requires a militarized borders that requires a ... police forces it requires complete surveillance of the population that requires um the undermining of democratic norms um it requires all of these things and these are the things that we're seeing around us um and the question will come\nOr do we hate the presence of these migrants and refugees more\nThan we hate living in the military and police states um if though that limited palate and police states but if not we will have to confront the reality that the kind of society that we could build that will keep these people out or not the kinds of site isn't any decent human being would choose to live in ...\nAnd on the one hand it speaks to you know something quite but not all that ... you know so that this is a stars version of the who the in the sun glasses\nOn the other hand it does speak to 'em something about the gays um and how the gaze of others does diminish our freedom in a sense um and how this was this one woman's reaction in particular context to that situation alternatively\nUm you know there's a woman who ah my my daughter was studying computer coding with [noise]\nAnd um and she came to the house and uh\nUh and she was a a cousin of mine a woman who runs in a AI a tech company I'm sort of interview the student and said oh she's the woman she's the one I think should teach your daughter but I assume cheated on the phone because someone came and her face was covered her head was covers and I thought I was a bit surprised\nUm Saddam and my daughter sort of found says in for her first computer code in class in my daughter's wearing the pink two two and a sort of tank top and sits down next to this teacher [noise]\nUm and it turns out that my daughter adores this teacher that's fifty just incredible fantastic\nAnd as I get to know this woman it turns out that this woman is you know a PHD student that you'd tutors on the side she supports not just herself but her sister's for elderly parents I'm just putting ourselves through this you know this doctorate and I mean she was just completely heroic a trailblazing you know a female figure and\nAnd so in many ways Nadia was something that I had to learn um bad a when a woman with something out of our own choice\nIt means what she intended\nAnd so and so what does it mean for not be on this mobile it's a bit ambiguous and um but I've met enough people now to recognize that uh it can sort of being really anything\nYeah and he began and you ended that onset by talking about ambiguity and Peter stay really with the reluctant fundamentalist you're talking about on set in that sense which essentially have to do with protection and preconception and all the things we for the what we don't understand whether it's the I Will pull romance\nAnd there's so many scenes in the book of tough guy at the book with you know moving into the age of uncertainty and when I put it down I thought this is a really melancholy book\nAs I've heard you talk about the future and what you were just saying the two hundred yes now this was even at that moment 'cause the world is moving in a positive direction I speak for a lot of\nHow do you see the show I you divided\nI think that the future contains both\nUm and it contains book and this is the sort of the duality of the future that the the the future is um it is both for each of us as individuals we will be extinguished we will cease to exist um the future contains tragedy at the level of individual\nBut yet it also contains rebirth and hope and optimism and beauty\nAnd its balancing those two things ride um how do we um uh an end in a sense one of the great failings and I think you know contemporary culture is all over the place\nIs I'm so much of our culture had been addressed to this question of you know the fact that the self and that to be a human being is to lose everything\nWe lose our childhood we lose our friends we lose our parents which is a lover we lose life and yet it is possible despises predicament to live a life that has so much beauty and so much connection and so much affection so much hope tenderness how do we do that [noise]\nNow [noise] um what I think it's occurred is that we have seen a victory you could say in cultural terms of of a kind of capitalist impulse\nWhich tells us that that self interest is the fundamental motivation of humanity and should be celebrated and she'll be elevated to the prime a position\nAbout self interest is very useful grades well if it is it is a productive thing it certainly is part of what can you know motivate us successful society\nExposed to the predicament that the self and I'm a society built entirely on self interest aside ... unbelievably terrified of the ending of the self [noise]\nUm and uh and and vulnerable to all kinds of perversion and so as the market basically settled into our anxieties because it's the markets not interested in having us less be less invested in the south\nUm and where so much of religion in the contemporary world is is deploying itself as a tribal affiliations system about group political dynamics as opposed to the individual or shared human\nA spiritual predicament um what kind of in limbo and so what what occurs is a profound sense of depression you know that that humanity is right now I think is engaged in a\nIn a kind of deep state of psychological depression and we see the manifestations of this everywhere so when a young child and Pakistan goes into a shopping mall with bombs strapped to their body and blow themselves up\nUm and kills twenty or thirty strangers and imagine that this could conceivably be considered a good death\nAnd when a young child in America goes into a school and shoots a dead thirty of them for years and then kill themselves and imagine that this could be a good death\nUm we have as a society utterly failed in addressing the question of what does constitute a good death we used to have ideas about this but now it seems to be that we are are so unwilling to engage I'm In this topic that we are on board\nAnd so I think it's worth looking across you know all of our collective wisdom as human beings all the stuff that we have known\nTo figure out you know what do we do about this\nAnd the truth is that there are things I'm Out of the melancholy of dusk there has always been a ... always been antidote\nI'm so for example you know you could imagine a kind of I'm a Buddhist or even Zen approach which would say that if one of routes once presence in the in this moment\nFully or end is aware and present in this moment the pasta begins to recede the future is revealed as a kind of illusion I'm at the moment expand to such a degree that are ... of the future moment diminishes or you could say that if you look at for example the ah the suit the tradition of ...\n... of somebody like Martin boob er and his eyes out a love based relational mysticism or similar traditions in so many other places but those things tell us is\nIf we love in the right way and strongly enough we transcend the self and the fact that the self and is less terrible and\nUm and what does this mean right this is all sort of high for looting stuff but like I've come to understand that I moved to Pakistan or my father for example is lost his brother recently lost his best friend recently [noise]\nUm and yet he speaks of the future and he says oh you know well are we going to get this bike paths sorted out so that would be knocking budget bicycle or you know we have to build this tree house because the kids are getting old enough to he's excited about these things in the future why because his love for his grandchildren has altered his ... his relationship to time\nTheir future is something that excites\nAnd each of us has has potential to have a kind of love which is not a possessive love and you know not the love of a I Love you so you are my wife or I own you\nBut ah the non possess a form of love which is not I love you because you make me less normally but I Love you which means I Want you to be less somebody because we can experienced is that too is an ... and there's so many others and so I think for me what's interesting is now to engage in a human conversation when we say look\nLet's take this stuff that's taken out of its specific religious non religious ethnic whatever traditions lead signed up a copy that everybody can participate in and let's begin to speak of it because not speaking of it has led us into horrific a state of of of crisis Mm [noise]\n\nAnd then the age of global conversation I've always found it a point of hopes that looming Islamic mystic than the best selling pirated America at twenty five yes he had some chance nation and sometimes misunderstanding\nBut I'm Still the sense that even a government span lost touch with individually ... able to learn from one another ... wider in our interests and the passions\nWhen you talk about your father and my mind just as I understand it and he came to to study in California and I'm guessing that your parents are in a way like my parents came here I'm into the to the American team their opportunity harder to find out swept or do you think the American dream can survive the American the on it [noise]\nDream and the American horror of all this court just write um America has has offered this is a vision which has been enormously attractive and an almost a productive\nAmericans also perpetrated unspeakable horrors\nIn the form of the treatment of the first migrants are to this continent I'm a you know the people we called Native Americans I'm In my own view because I think of no one is truly native I I think we're all migrants but if you imagine the first migrants who came thousands of years before and how they would treat", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "08"}
