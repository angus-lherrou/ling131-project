Hi I'm to me you're sort of an autonomous with New York in the seventies and eighties and that's where I happen to be from and I just I'm curious about what are your thoughts on sentimentality or is there anything that makes you sentimental and if so what ended up what are your thoughts in general about ...\n... is a very poisonous things\nIs a really bad thing ... that's why you have Donald Trump as a president you know this that it that it's the ...\nThe sound is is is truthfully about something that never existed\nOr I should say you know when we're actually on he ran for mayor the first time we don't see very many um political ads in New York especially for presidential elections because it's the most expensive media markets and because you know they're not going to trick New York into voting for Republican for president [noise] um [noise]\nBut we see local or political as and when Giuliani first ran for mayor\nI have seen people you know the the ads are almost exactly Trump as you know later years and I said why she's had for Giuliani basically he's saying vote for me and there'll be Nineteen fifty eight again and when you're was great\nYou know and it ... the thing that Trump does and that Trump did and you know it was who was a great for\nYou guys that was great for show was not great for anyone else New York in the seventies um too much to my astonishment I'm I Am constantly stopping the street by people in their twenties telling me they wish they lived in Europe in the seventies\nNow this is really not a good thing because I Know that when I was in my twenties I wasn't constantly thinking I Wish I Lived in Europe in the thirties you know [noise]\n\nIs the job of people who are young to do new things\nThey'll have for their own lives you know that's fine that's harmless you know that's just human nature\nUm but it's very bad for the culture for sure not just the society it is terrible for the culture that is why we have seen for the less than thirty five years this kind of round Robin of collages you know that you see an every single art form\nYou know I I went to a party for someone in their twenties is at a friend's kid um and I knew every single song they're playing now that's not right [noise]\nSo\nI mean when when people say it wasn't you're better in the seventies I made an effort to think what is it better when you're finished and nice 'cause I was in my twenties\nOr it was it actually better in the seventies you know this is very hard to tell because it wasn't a more fun in the seventies you know and I think well it was certainly more fun for me you know because I was in my twenties you know if you're not having more funding or twenties then you'd or in your sixties your if you don't have money you're twenty you're never going to have fun\nBeen saying that people do say thank you for coming I'll say You're welcome and they looked at me like you are so rude\n[noise] ... if you mentioned Billie like in the Senate is apparently there was\nThere was this time where they senators walked off arm in arm you know and some wonderful are of friendship I'm certainly must have been better than it is now I'm there that would certainly be better um you know there's constant talk about how partisan politics have become\nI mean is it in a way kind of funny I mean\nPolitics partisan politics it's redundant you know ... a part of it not the point of holidays that the ... um the problem with ... that that they're part of the problem with apologies to Republicans [noise]\nQuestions\nFrom the center of the balcony high high\nWould you please tell us a little bit about your participation in law and order [laughter] um\n[laughter] I Hope we are the what I please tell you or at least her um about my participation in law and order which was a TV show um where\nI played um either I'm a recurring part as an arraignment judge 'em I got this part by begging them\nTo give me the car [noise] um I I Know a democracy who played the police captain him and uh that that that I mentioned wall but who invented this thing and I should put me on the I I Love letter I still love law and order I Love it there is not the only thing\nI Know that other people find other ways we're allowed yoga buys you know [noise]\nI'm not the spy already might imagine but\nWhatever that usually get it done others like three\nYears that I've become the Dalai Lama\nBecome instantly relaxed and one of my biggest objections the president to\nTalk of their culture is why there is not a law and order channel [noise] the guys\nWe're going to give me this part as a real judge 'em and I had to go and audition for him\nAnd the producers sit there and I I did the audition and I knew I was horrible and the second I stopped I said look I Know it was really bad I said you know this person too big for me I'm don't give me this part give me an arraignment judge part because that's really ... by two sentences\nAnd the British had a friend actors don't say I Know I failed the audition so give me a different part I said I Know but I'm not an actor so I can say it so they didn't give me this part\nAnd it was fantastic because first of all you got to where the judicial robe\nWhich the law and order was done on film so it was just like shooting a movie show you know the work days even if you were on for two minutes or like you know twelve sixteen hours you'd be there forever um the Shaq and I would arrive I Would go to the wardrobe department put on my ... they would say Fran you don't have to put the robot now oh that's okay\nI don't I don't know [noise] and I remember\nThey shot it and in the studios which are on the river where they were judged started then to build now is finished unfortunately this past you know for people to like ride bicycles and skateboard and like like the whole city turned into some summer camp [noise]\nAnd I was outside smoking\nCigarettes where am I robe and this kid came ... down on a skateboard this kid with like a million tattoos and piercings and he saw me and he stopped like that and he said I didn't know there was a court here and I said there's a court everywhere\n[noise] ...\nI really love I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed being on law and order I I also\nReal uh every other judge on TV copied me because\nWhen you said at the bench which is the best she'd ever in any room in the world you know you sit there you're hired then everyone else of real comfortable chair and you have a gamble [noise]\nAnd because the gavel is there I took to like Bain Capital\nAnd I instantly got dozens of letters from lawyers and judges many from judges you are not supposed to gamble you're not ... by the way to judge you are not supposed to go unless there is an outburst or something in the courtroom um however now every single television judge ...\n[noise] and she just in or is this double thing you cannot gamble and [noise] I Can't tell you what a plus\n[noise]\nThis is from the back of the center of the orchestra I said I ... I I remember seeing and you ah sorry 'cuse me I remember seeing you on the documentary Paris has burning and I wanted to know what you thought about route Paul and the directing becoming more popular [noise] I apparently in Paris was burning which I think\nWas made like twenty five year I mean it was a really long time ago um I'd forgotten about it is apparently been revived I'm at because lots of people who are young talk about this movie um [noise] uh\nI I Know we're Paul I mean I've actually met ripple it is a TV show right\nThe drag say whatever you know that it's like a contest for Dr Wayne which is now on television I\nMean this is the kind of thing that used to be like a very covert thing because it was against the law\nSo it was very covert it was extremely different and now it's on television and this was apparently the most progress we can hope for but in the seventies for instance uh sometimes I Would be at a party or someplace and someone would come in with drag and I would always say how'd you get your 'cause you could not walk on the street like that you'd be arrested\nYou could not be on the shopping like that you know only candy could do that because people thought that she was a girl\nShe didn't really look like a girl but it never occurred to anyone that a man with a look like that\nYou know should there was an upside to this repression by the way I'm which is that you know she could walk around like that um I Know that now it's like a it's so interesting that we live in a country I think this is a very popular TV show\nUm which means that many many people in the country like this and think it's fine and it's okay and they still vote for Donald Trump\nShow you know these things or you know are not always how they look you know there's just not always a sign of you know being pro Russian I'm at\nThe ... parents just burning was about um [noise] I Can't see what it's called them these contests\nVoting rights to those ... things I used to go to them\nOn they were ... they were had tactically interesting because they're completely invented\nYou do that and I remembered that when I did interview for Paris's burning 'em a lot of people that we're talking about that then you know imagine to me what was interesting about it was that it was mistaken at that time for some kind of a humanism what'd you have the\nNot the desire to be rebellious you know you don't have to be rebellious should everyone already hate you show that I think there's just things that people don't really understand about this show is interesting to me that it ended up it's like a popular network television show 'em and I was very popular I don't\nThink that real voting exist anymore there's no way that it could be good who could afford to rent those places\n... I'd\nI'd love to know your take on the me too movement\nOkay she's left it on my take on me too movement because you think that might have some contrary opinion like that idea or um [noise]\nThis is one of these things that I have found somebody be surprising you know I never imagined this would happen not necessarily in years because being a woman was the shame from like IV [noise] until like six months ago\n[noise] so naturally\nIt never occurred to me this one ever change\nYou know and so it it really changed I mean the first\nYou know I don't know the first dozen guys who got caught I Know every single one of them personally every single one of them and if you told me one minute before that these guys would be gone\nI Would never believed in a million years now in a\nMillion years now I have to say I mean like Harvey for instance I think it was the first one I'm a new heart rate for a million years I Know a million stories about already I Believe every single one of them but I never heard these rape story I never heard this violence George I never heard them\nBe and that is because you know it's one thing like ... I'm going to get a partner movie which by the way that the definition for that would always have been the movie business um [noise]\nThe but the the ... the violence and read I never heard that I heard a million stories about Charlie Rose I never heard the stories about the insurance you know I never heard the stories chairs and how I feel I Believe every single woman proved to me she's lying [noise]\nShowed\nMe a movie of her life or you know the judge and the reason I Believe this is because I Am a woman but really more importantly I was a girl\nYou know and I truly believe that even the best men and I believe that my friends who are men are the best men because otherwise they wouldn't be my friends I mean I wouldn't be their friend is more show even", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "city": "Pullman", "day": "29"}
