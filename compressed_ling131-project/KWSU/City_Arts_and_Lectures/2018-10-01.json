[laughter]\n\nAlso a small time gone up or crook\nAnd as the depletes us funds on his journey across the country he also becomes a ...\nI've just tell you all the you know she'll ever really need to know especially if you're interested in finding [noise]\n\nSorry ... people have asked me why did you write a book about a hedge fund guy you know why not your usual Russian losers [laughter] why not write about yourself more uh in the past decade I became aware of the fact that a large number of the friends I had come of age with the Manhattan were gone\nDisplaced by rising costs to Berlin or\nAbu Dhabi or the eagle rock part of LA are the mid Hudson Valley are my friends many of whom were below alumni of fibers in high school in Oberlin College college college college uh\nWorked as writers and graphic designers academics and journalists the heart of what used to be called the creative middle class but they were all gone and as I Walk down the now unfamiliar streets of my city eyeing a new breed of closely shaved athletic individuals I kept wondering who are these people you know\nUpon closer inspection I discovered that they mostly worked for banks or hedge funds are private equity firms now\nI'd met only a handful of bankers in my life but around twenty twelve I decided that my next novel would be about finance since there was no one else left in Manhattan to write about [noise] and I realized pretty early on in my research that people in finance often had a different view of reality than most of the people that previously known\nAn older currency trader Adam ... not going to mention UPS by name I'm kidding wasn't UPS or a complaint to me all the struggles of the middle class [noise]\nAnd he said because I Am the middle class and I said well how do you define the middle class and he said you know just people struggling just earning between two and four million dollars a year [laughter]\nSo when it was time to cobble together a character like Barry Coleman who actually makes a lot more than four million dollars a year\nI kept thinking back to all the wonderful diluted people I've met along the way somebody with you a chapter from successive just introduced you briefly to bury Cohen this scene is sending Atlanta it's about midway through the book buried gets off the bus in the middle of this journey and did that says ... Jeff park\nWho we actually fired from its hedge fund at one point he's also run out of money he's left New York with nothing but a roller board full of watcher because he collects watches some people do that\nUm [noise] and he had to get rid of his credit cards so he's in Atlanta to beg Jeff part for a little bit of a bridge\nOkay [laughter]\nJust hurts living room was a palatial as the entrance to a modest New York museum enormous golden light hung from the ceiling which was at least twenty feet in height just had a full head of hair gums didn't proceed and he did push ups in the middle of the day\nHe had gone to Cornell but had not played lacrosse like most of the guys and Jeff and berries hedge funds\nSo what's up buried Jeff said just passing through decided to look me up\nThey were sitting in Jeff's kitchen he had brought out a bottle of ... a year and was serving it straight up quite decadent for one twenty seven PM\nHealth insurance part to do for a living he had cashed out of berries hedge fund was zero all of this is going to sound crazy Barry said uh-huh I'm On a journey a journey my boss [noise]\nBarely knew that he would eventually have to explain his flight from New York to people in this tax brackets\nShe knew that news of his melt down would immediately formed the latest bulletin in the incest was bloodthirsty world from which he had sprung but he doubted it would really surprise anyone the people in this world could be nuts\nOne hedge fund was essentially a cult with its own Bible ritual mind controlling feats of strength one fellow at another fund a quants billionaire played piano at a third grade bar about passing around a tip jar\nLike your first ankle monitor bracelet or your fourth divorce the official break with reality it was an important part of any hedge fund titans biography [noise]\nThings I've seen Barry said and he told Jeff a few of his brown adventure so far ... parts seemed interested he poured more drinks although insisted Barry chase his with water it's a bit like you're doing a middle aged version of on the road gym [laughter]\nLike the one I Mexican guy in New Jersey you said fell asleep on your shoulder that sounds pretty terrible acts\nThat's exactly right bury shouted oh no wonder we go to Jeff park to host them the man had literally sensibilities beyond most of his colleagues they really did a good job of educating up at Cornell [laughter] [noise]\nI used to take the greyhound to visit my uncle's family in Savannah Jeff said everyone there and looked at us like we were freaks [laughter] everyone looks at me like I'm a free you peanut butter freak Barry Barry Took that has the highest of complements he was bonding with his former employees will be it\nYup I moved back down to take care of my parents your parents or I Want to say from China\nClose enough Jeff park said [noise]\nMy wife in India and berries that rocks Jeff said [laughter] you ought to get married buried said completely forgetting that his own marriage was but a team of seven lawyers sort of put\nHis instinct to help Jeff park was overwhelming you remembered his wife's friend that Asian woman from Brooklyn Tina or Lena\nI throw away my cell phone Barry said construct something on your computer a laptop was provided it had been a week since he had touched a keyboard you brought up his wife's profile what gorgeous family you have Jeff park said pointing at the profile photo of his wife and son\nWhen I worked for you I think you were just about to get married God that kid of yours those eyes\nYeah Barry said his hand frozen over the keyboard that's nice but here's what I really wanted to show you scroll through the list of seem as friends until he found the right one\nNow this girl is funky Barry said she called me a tool to my face and I think she's pretty intellectual like ... all one night in Brooklyn she made these great Chinese dumplings for us\nI bet your folks with lover\nMina Kim Jeff parked right off the screen not really up my alley Barry was heartbroken but she's Chinese Jeff parks there to Adam I'm more into the southern belle type he finally said a\nVery side but thanks for looking out for me or like the woman from fiddler on the roof [laughter]\nVery sort of knew what he was talking about the matchmaker matchmaker jumped park at a wide cultural reach [laughter] well I'm going to make it my mission is to get married you said size guy like you I'm not averse to the ladies jump parks that I've designed this place with them and mine's\nHouse so it's\nMost of everything you read in this book is an act of journalism I don't have the imagination to conjure up the house from nothing you know I I Am not that skills you know [noise]\nUm so most of that actually happened I did not smoke that crack rocket buried done not for lack of trying [laughter] I don't know how to track anyone else if you have any I'll be in the twelve have [laughter] I'm kidding there's no numbers to the seats [noise]\nYou know but but almost everything that happens to bury a with a few exceptions uh happened to me and and I think the sort of the really big repeal of the the trip um was around\nMississippi Louisiana a when a group of white supremacist did decide to board the bus and started speaking very loudly first about crucify Muslims and Jews I was like I Wonder if those two\nBut you know and and and Barry does this and I did this as well I got all countries port Louisiana and there was a New Testament coloring book and it was like [laughter] Romans to Donald Trump would say ... or I'm On a few perhaps Armenian or Greek [noise]\nUm so you know but but they also started speaking very loudly about ... and and and most of the people on the bus at that juncture and where people of color\nAre but they must be very loudly about Breitbart and which is the first time I've heard I've known about Breitbart but it was the first time I actually heard anyone used that term you know in about\nA ... and and talking about the upcoming white supremacy and and we passed through rambling states which is a traditionally a African American college and they're all these students milling about and you could see the look on their faces because they really were not well educated [noise] this anger and one of them said well\nThey have their colleges and one day we'll have our [noise] I thought what part of darkness don't you understand\n[noise]\nThat was the level of of of what was happening you know I got an awful lot of really fragile but also eliminated and then you know and then the people on the bus became the people in the\nIn the White House you know and that was the last thing that I expected would happen mhm but at the ... and that's the crux of that journey I think for barriers discovering everything but you know that he didn't expect\nUm one of the ... one of the challenges that Barry had his his son has she has um been given the diagnosis of severe autism and um I wondered why you chose that\nAs a as a challenge for him something he has to reconcile short\nShort or autism is primarily communication disorder and I think Barry has difficulty communicating not even with other people but with themselves um and I don't want to give too much away about the novel but as it progressed as we learn things about Barry the way he developed his first friendships he\nCreated almost like a computer program that he called his friend moves you know when somebody said does he would answer that\nBut I think the experience also is very personal to\nMe um when when I came to this country I couldn't speak English and um it didn't have many friends\nAnd I kept missing every social cue imaginable and I had my friends were all these misfits and looking back now and I don't want to read\nScience to look for 'em and they welcomed me and they were my friends and I love them and\nAnd as I grew older I realized that many of my very good friends have autistic kids are I think many of the people I've met in the hedge fund world are certainly on one side of the spectrum and\nIn fact they would talk very openly about you know people would always discuss was on the spectrum and who's not so that was something interesting but also I just feel a real kinship I mean I think the big highlight of the last two years was\nGetting drunk with Temple Grandin at lunch I mean\nPlease tell me about that she's the best\nI mean I Love her you know first of all these ridiculous stereotype people have about you know the spectrum to every person his picture was as different as any other ... present the second\nAnd it's all the ideas that people have which are on so much for my generation was the movie Rainman which obviously you know cause but but she is hilarious um complete every ... every subject of course with a certain focus that comes as part of\nHaving a being on the spectrum but also just hilarious and what she kept talking about you know\nRenting her hotel room we were in this very fancy very fancy resort and I'm In the island Ga and she was talking about getting a guitar and just smashing her whole room [laughter] I Love you or have you been all my life [laughter] I don't know kind of Temple Grandin is mashed potatoes yeah she destroyed that thing\n[noise] she talked about it this\nI don't want to spread misinformation we already have enough of that [laughter] but anyway but I mean I I really felt that that this would be um it'll be a challenge to bury it would have to taste because\nSo many of the hedge fund people I met its like their lives or been so planned out to make up for their crappy childhoods that it's you know\nI'm going to meet the perfect young wife she's going to end Barry actually says she's going to have the perfect young eggs and they're going to have three perfect children and he has this fantasy of three sinks side by side so that all the children can wash their hands and splashing murder thing you know\nAnd he's got all the brands picked out for the [noise]\nAnd you know um but then when things go wrong there's a lack of understanding of what to do with it you know so first Barry tries to throw money at the problem which helps a little bit but doesn't really\nCreate for I mean the kid is non verbal so kid doesn't start talking just because millions of dollars are being dedicated to it so you know so being the person that he is having no parenting of his own I have not experienced any real loving parents\nBut I really wanted to find somebody I mean I find characters interesting when they're at their highest prices point you know I'm stories about happy people with good pension plans are not my thing\n[laughter] I'm staying with Barry and his family for a minute I I'm very curious about the way you write you'll I mean to you all male ... revolt England like Iran I think\nThat that old [laughter] but they are all ... ultimately in daring you any passionately ... to read it does feel something in St Louis and even if they on at times task I'm\nBut I'm All right for a while and it was a\nUm [laughter] but you know the characters are very different and I can you talk about how you write males I says female characters well again everything\nIs sort of done uh like I said I have no imagination everything is done by [noise]\nTaking seven or eight people putting them into a giant vitamin mixed or whatever it's called and then you know chopping down in creating something new I'm sort of the characters I met a lot of hedge fund why we are and they were absolutely fascinated because they were all very highly credential but in fact\nThey were usually much smarter than their husbands but because their husband that may one or two good bad and made you know a hundred million here three hundred million there they were sort of one of them said to me ah well I'm just here to cure ate my family's\nLife while and I thought wow we're vaccine feudal times you know and and that's what really\nSurprised me because these relationships um felt very much like that you know where people live lives that don't have anything to do with the way lives are lived among people who the twenty first century and you know the advanced economies if you will or anywhere else or to you you need two incomes to to survive so you know that was a very interesting\n... and many and the moment the shirt and they started flowing I mean they just by their husbands for the most part right you know and the husbands didn't understand their lives you know so it was this constant friction ... and you throw in ... and you're throwing something like a kid with with was nonverbal and\nAll hell breaks loose you know so\nI think the set up as it is very interesting um ... and again like it's a very unusual because most people don't live like this anymore it's a real throwback\nYeah they they\nNo no I mean you know I Know my mom\nCalled the real failure right\nThe only women I like her are women was can I can tell me on my characters are\nGrotesque [laughter] that that's what I'm drawn to that [laughter] that's the way I come to San Francisco [laughter]\nYou're listening to a conversation with Gary Stein God it's just ... ... ...\nStaying with Russia for a bit I've I'm curious about how how is Russian Shima different from American humor well\nThe humor I grew up with is sort of Russian Jewish humor and the two are I think that you know Jews have been in Russia for so long that\nThey've infected it with their humor the way they've done with Seinfeld here you know a lot so it's part and parcel I think it's a very kind of fatalistic humor kind of humor from the edge of the grave kind of stuff and I always tell when joke but I'm worried I told us the last time I was here so I Do tell him again\nAnd again even had it on your science thank you well it's um it's a visual joke so people listening in probably won't be able to see it but [noise]\nUm 'cause you can live really well like I'm at the food is grates a tiny village has to ... bars I mean how many cuts a lot of the bargain unique you know\nFrankly one of the village of five hundred people one for every two hundred fifty and wanted to see [laughter]\nSorry to hear jokes we'll see how we got our own problems I Love any\n... joke [laughter] um\nAre you always working on something yeah yeah yeah I Do a lot of stuff even when you're on these parents have\nLoan long enough to know all the time every second this is this is an eighty seven day tour and crazy day Eighteen and I'm Still pretty fresh but\nYeah a ... electric shock yeah there's a link I carrying ... uh uh no I don't I don't I Can't well you know I Do like you're on the plane a lot so I Try to read up all the research material for the next book a job\nAnd you get to him that's all yeah for weekends I drop by and say Hi to the south Sudan kid and you know [laughter]\nActually things like don't worry that people will read your book\n[laughter] so I think [laughter] but they do [laughter]\nAnd it will be a new friend yeah that's interesting yeah I have to find now you know NATO friends to infiltrate and make fun of them yeah any ideas anyone many doctors in the house\nI'm sure I don't know it's a good question I think I Want to write about diners and the big diner fan now so I'm going to spend some time in diners like [noise]\nYou know hanging out with the prep crux of prep press sorry my headphones on what kind of a lot of fresh trucks yeah that's that's my old novel um prep cook um stuff like that really get to know that world a little bit different\nYou can do a great line and let 'em in like ... and one of the hedge fund\nActual conversation I'm really talking about I think it was was ethical culture of friends one of those schools\nAnd she said well carry I Love the school because it's so diverse when I was like yeah I don't know what do you mean because it doesn't seem to me and she was like well some of the kids need schools their dads aren't even hedge fund manager for the doctors or lawyers\n[laughter]\nI was like a\nGoing to go to the bathroom in practice down\nThat [laughter]\nIt just kept on giving what can they do the hedge fund managers likes mixing awful yeah the ones that I became really good friends with that like it because they felt the same way I mean I think has ultimately they were asking themselves that question of what the hell am I doing I'm losing money for my clients\nEven though I'm making a fortune you know how does this work what's the ultimate what's the point of this many of them harbored you know dreams one writes really well and kind of want it to be I think a writer and until all this money happens ah\nAh some of the ones I really liked also approached this more as an intellectual question you know because they were math and physics PHD's to begin with so it's like how do we solve a problem not just how do I make a lot of money although in the and they get co opted by the money as well\nSo you know I I didn't make some decent friends from all of us who are who are you know\nNot bad people get jobs there aren't you [laughter] can you explain the title\nLike success or what would it be giving away too much if it did explain well I'll say this but when I grew up in like Barry I grew up in the middle that cleans and right across the border is great neck which is a much yeah\nNot a great neck so great so that [laughter] a little like was at that point\nA kind of working class Irish and Italian neighborhood now it's more Indian Korean or and they're actually chopping down like this happens a lot they're cutting down these old cute colonialism building these gigantic mansions or many mansions or image mansions but any way across the border was the old money great neck and\nUh it wasn't entirely wealthy there were different pockets of it but like success\nWith something that just because of the names six [laughter]\nYou know when you're poor kid it was like I got to live in lake success Sunday and I would just want to walk around they had these very positive private drives and you can see a cul de sacs the very word cul de sac sounded like magic to me you know and and big houses and anyway it was it was a real immigrant kind of dream lake successful\nKen houses in like success but that still remains the unattainable goal because you really all the money in the world doesn't really get you to like success you have to you have to have it in your soul\nNow what does that mean [laughter]\nIt's been a long night that I just [laughter] um\nI mean I talk about immigration midnight immigrant yeah [noise] yeah\nWe're going to be naturalized soon I bet you know that's what he tried to know where that is the scariest one of the scariest things that I think that's happened um [noise] it's\nPure fascism the whole blood and soil arguments you have to be born here or else you're at our mercy we can take away your sins ship you know we can say wow you lied on your for him but you know it's a slippery slope to well he said something bad about me on Twitter so I mean it's it's it really frightened me ...\nAnd how to your parents and community in Michigan [noise]\nSoviet Jews like Trump I'm quite you know he is strong and he's like ... you know just private all [laughter]\nFrom all the law so\nIt's not a lot you know [noise] uh I Will get my parents did they did not vote for I think I don't think they voted for anyone I think they dislike both candidates so get them for them that's pretty that's saying something and I think you know I think they believe I think my mother at one point said well Trump piece of Britain's pocket so I was very evident\nAnybody trying to think of it and then you'll piece about um you didn't didn't leave Russia to come to another to another Russia Russia\nBut that's the scary thing in a way you know after the collapse of the Soviet Union when I thought what happened was there were there was a hopeful period where we really fast even before putting things started to go a wry economically and otherwise the whole country was in a state of collapsed but the thought was that over time\nRussia would become more like America or like Europe or like Scandinavian the sense that there would be\nFreedom of freedom freedom of press of of of of speech um free markets um [noise] all these different things would come together but in the end\nAmerica became more like Russia mhm the opposite thing happens and the kind of clip talk received that Russia really pioneered with such gusto\nIs now seen here you know the Trump family bodies a lot of it they it had deals in Azerbaijan which is like you know Russians look up to ... the height of corruption that tries to fight corruption they got a lot you know\nAnd of course Trump is doing but cool so\nI mean look I'm a south under Soviet Ashkenazi pessimistic [laughter] it's not the glass half full there's no glass you know [noise]\nThe question is you know since I had a little\nKid like the one thing my parents did right if they knew when to the parts mhm or will there I Hope they will never be such a time 'cause I Love this country I really do and and taking that greyhound trip you know in the middle of all this crap that was happening with white supremacist could join you and all this stuff you know\nThe country was beautiful as seen from the window of a greyhound and it was spectacular from the foothills in North Carolina to the civil rights cacti of\nOf Arizona into the mess says it's there's nothing like it in the world and it just goes on and on and the people are wonderful in so many ways to\nHow can we have screwed this whole thing up so fast\nI it's shocking\nBut it makes you want to fight for it all the more it down I mean he does\nI think this is a good night for a and a half hour conversation and looking out for questions in the audience what will happen it's delightful come up\nAnd if you have a question for Gary raise your hand in some of them will come to the microphone questions in the front rally in Maine okay Hi thank you so\nYou mentioned that the people on the greyhound of I'm Sorry to cover the White House\nAnd the people in the spectrum are taking over our CDs so the big cities so when you mentioned that they're your friends how to move out of the ... what's up with the rest of the people in a country I don't think the people in the state for taking over the city\nI I'm not sure I said that that would be interesting I I like that actually of\nTemple Grandin was the mayor of New York I Would be so hip with that [laughter] what a good question what's gonna happen to everyone right that that really is the ultimate question it's a question that goes beyond politics than humans more in the economic you know what happens when\nEverything is done by computer you know not just the driving cars but you know law I mean they're working on therapist computers that will be your analysts you know what else comes to mind about\nThat I'm so here is some more out of that um [noise] so\nYou know with that in mind what future do we have ... ... what what was the ... you know and of course people around universal basic income and stuff like that but it's still we're at a precipice of something so new that could be a great thing it could be a terrible thing but given", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Arts and Lectures", "city": "Pullman", "day": "01"}
