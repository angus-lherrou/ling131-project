regulars I should say she wrote about it for the New Yorker magazine where she's a staff writer she'll it's good to talk to you again great to be or ... show or maybe the place to start actually it's just with a little primer on on who or what Sinclair is because it's it's been a little while a couple of months anyway since this company has been in the news\nSinclair the largest owner of broadcast television stations in the U.S a and a lot of people are not terribly familiar with them the way they hear about CNN and NBC and other big networks uh Sinclair owns a hundred and Ninety two stations in eighty nine markets\nSo they are enormously influential they're seen by a lot of people are but they're they're largely outside the coastal media bubble\nBack up to that size thing because that is

incredibly they did a managed to stay within the strict interpretation of the law although they they violated the spirit of law one could say but yeah it's what they did was strictly legal um but it was it was brazen and it was pushing the line\nFor sure so to the to the other half of their question then why did the Federal Communications commission what Sinclair do this so many times\nThere is no simple answer to that I mean that the FCC comes under a lot of criticism for allowing too much consolidation has been a problem under both Democratic and Republican administrations\nSure everything
