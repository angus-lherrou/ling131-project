P.\nB. Sinclair\nBroadcast television stations in the U.S a and a lot of people are not terribly familiar with them the way they hear about CNN and NBC and other big networks uh Sinclair owns a hundred and Ninety two station in eighty nine markets\nSo they are enormously influential they're seen by a lot of people ah but they're they're largely outside the coastal media bubble\nBack up to that size thing because that is is relevance in a lot of ways uh for the context of this article because there are regulations and and considerations about who can on what media was right\nRight well regulation of television has changed over time and it has loosened overtime bite in general there are a lot of restrictions around media ownership for reasons of preserving competition and local markets and also because\nA diverse points of view and diverse sources of news are considered to be sort of fundamental to uh maintaining a free and open democracy\nSo deep down into this a little bit and give me just maybe the ... the first one of these the Sinclair did back in the day was in Baltimore and and explain how they got around the rules I suppose is who's the question what can\n[noise] so so what they did was they would acquire a competitor station ah definitely would say well you need to divest you need to sell one of these stations in order to comply with the regulations and the laws\nBut then uh they came up with a very clever trick up the help of their lawyers and they would just simply divest the second station to a shell company\nRun by sort of a business associates or a member of that mess family which is a family that controls Sinclair you know so they would be able to say to the FCC that they sold the station but in fact the station with still not really independent and then they would sign an agreement\nThat would give them the right to supply all of the programming to the station\nLet's get the Sinclair response when you ask them you know how did you guys get away with ... and they say there are a lot has been for many years we had metal legal requirements right\nYeah they I mean incredibly they did a managed to stay within the strict interpretation of the law although they they violated the spirit of the law one could say but yes what they did was strictly legal um but it was it was raised and it was pushing the line for sure\nSo to the to the other half of the question then why did the Federal Communications commission led Sinclair do this so many times\nNo simple answer to that I mean the the SPCA comes under a lot of criticism for\nAdministration um they have allowed a number of enormous monopolies to form now I should say that I'm In the late nineties the FCC did investigate Sinclair for that\nI sort of fraudulent divested ... strategy they ended up finding that Sinclair had violated in some of these rules and they were not making good faith truly independent divested ... and um they find the company braced herself forty thousand dollars which is really not a lot of money to a large corporation like Sinclair", "show_name": "Marketplace", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "22"}
