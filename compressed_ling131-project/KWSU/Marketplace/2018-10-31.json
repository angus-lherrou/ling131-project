in times square in New York City back in the Nineteen seventies and perhaps because of the subject matter\nShowed a lot of press when it went on the air but HBO and the show are back in the news this week for a new hire that HBO has made there is now on the set of the news and intimacy coordinator sick don't coordinator for sex scenes brain occurs\nMostly clean but it is probably going to have to get a little bit racy bringing working with a program Hi Kay [noise] so there's going to sound like a word where to start this interview but I'm the ... the entire premise of this article and and the job of\nIntimacy coordinators is that for actors this shit is a workplace it's the office\nYeah and I mean I think that you know it hasn't been treated like that in the past I don't think that it was necessarily\nOut of Valentine or on purpose but people get really uncomfortable effects especially in a workplace but it's something that really needs to be spoken about explicit we win sex and sexuality is involved in the actual job of making a film or making a TV show\nShow within the bounds of what the Federal Communications commission will let us talk about on the radio so for me as as it were the first ... the leader of this article that you wrote is it's really limited you know\n[laughter] yeah\nI started my article sort of trying to\nGet readers to enter into a TV set and what it's like for an actor and went that can be on the day when they're filming a sex scene and the case of and we need who plays Laurie on Deuce she is naked are half naked and she's pretending it's far more or less tax and\nShe's got all these eyes on her and this is a situation where I think a lot of actresses has felt\nExtremely uncomfortable a because what ... told me and she's the intimacy grenade or on the juice said nobody has an opportunity to explicitly say this is what I'm comfortable with\nHow did it come to pass that there was an intimacy coordinator unsaid to begin with\nYeah so after season one I'm Emily native I mentioned plays Laurie she realized that filming the sex scenes\nWas really taking a toll on her and she needed something to change that she went to the exact before season to started filming and said hey I Need some support I Need help on that HBO started doing research and they stumbled on a leash or at us and our company\nSo how ... with the government that these are the you know simulated sections where you have to say that right but but how does she do how did she do that\nAlisha well off and get the scraps and she will go to the actor and she'll tell them what's in the script and then she will work it out with them defining what they feel comfortable with talking to them about their boundaries about anything that they would like on that\nIt's got about then when it comes to the day of filming she is often standing within I shot of Dr um she is usually looking at the monitor to see how the scene is playing a so she's there to comment on the\nAnd she will help then protect themselves should tell them how to make things look more real without them having to do something that feels more sexual to them so it's about choreography the same way that we have fights ...\nRight uh HBO it it kind of makes sense is is leading the way out of this or at least among the first because they've got this reputation for doing a whole lot of sex do you suppose it's going to spread is there a movement now to get it dementia coordinators and the broader spectrum especially given where we are in this society today with with me too and all of
