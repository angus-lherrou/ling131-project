has been fits a sports franchise worth more than three billion dollars but the Lakers are more than just a basketball team right there a global brand and one of the great teams in NBA history although not recently and not really the season yet but more about that in a minute\nFundamentally the Lakers are and this is the way ... dad longtime owner of the team Jerry Buss would have wanted it during the entertainment company with outsized influence but you've got to deliver on the court and lately as I said the Lakers haven't\nSo Jeanie Buss went after and she got this past offseason LeBron James the best basketball player in the world right now and she brought him to this building there's tons of natural light clean modern lines also a whole lot of purple and gold all with the business of basketball firmly in mind\nWe moved here just over a year ago we had outgrown our other training facility which is just a couple of blocks away and our entire revenue generating arm was in a building across the parking lot so we were a very divided company\nSo this was as we said are overlooking basketball courts and I mean there's like three basketball courts and whatever it is um this was a strategic investment for the company\nHe yeah yes that the architects that we ended up choosing talked about how architecture could change culture\nAnd an organization and that was you know exactly what we were looking to do back in twenty twelve we had a player by the name of Dwight Howard that played on the Lakers I mean and we were at our old facility he came up to my office\nAnd he said can

without having to divert through anything or being stopped and backtrack\nAlso volume so I'm sure it's a little walk and talk so okay so\n... this way and as you noted um we have I think six or seven conference rooms so that is one that's called twenty tat and that address on the front there\nFor the for the last ... yeah I don't know each one of the ones that are surface but that's that's what I Know that's a million dollar question\nWhen the Lakers are in town or the busier around here so many great that it's only nine o'clock in the morning but\nUm I guess when the Lakers are here that would be when they would normally practice outbreaks here in our um gee league a coaching staff as they get ready for ... yeah that that's how the Lakers is our team\nUm that we used to develop our

after the midterm election inshallah Hi I'm Jennifer ... for marketplace [noise]\n\n\nThere's a show on HBO the debuted bit more than a year ago but ... it's called it in the middle of its second season now and it's about the porn insects business in times square in New York City back in the Nineteen seventies and perhaps because of the subject matter\nShow got a lot of press when it went on the air but HBO and the show are back in the news this week for a new hire that HBO is made there is now\nOn the set of the news and intimacy coordinator sank don't coordinator for sex scenes brain occurs article about it in Rolling Stone is called how HBO is changing sex scenes that forever and I should tell you we're going to keep it mostly clean but it is\nProbably going to have to get a little bit racy bringing welcome to the program Hi Kay so there's going to sound like a weird way to start this interview but um it the ... the entire premise of this article and and the job of\nIntimacy coordinators is that for actors this shit is a workplace it's the office\nYeah and I mean I think that you know it hasn't been treated like that in the past I don't think that it was necessarily\nOf non Tanner on purpose by people get really uncomfortable effects especially in a workplace but it's something that really needs to be spoken about explicitly when sex and sexuality is involved in the actual job of making a sound are making a TV show\nShow within the bounds of what the Federal Communications commission will let us talk about on the radio system for me as it has it were the first the leader of this article that you wrote is it's really eliminating you know\n[laughter] yeah I started my article started trying to get readers to enter into a TV set and what it's like for an actor and what that can be\nShe is naked are half naked and she's putting a farm or those facts and she's got all these eyes on her and this is a situation where I think a lot of actresses has felt\nExtremely uncomfortable a because what ... told me and she's the intimacy Nader on the juice said nobody has an opportunity to explicitly say this is what I'm comfortable with\nHow did it come to pass that there was an intimacy coordinator unsaid to begin with\nYeah so after season one I'm Emily native I mentioned plays Laurie she realized that something on the sex scenes\nWas really taking a toll on her and she needed something to change so she went to the exact before season to started filming and said hey I Need some support I Need help on that HBO started doing research and they stumbled on a leash or at us and our company\nSo how we got to be that these are the you know simulated sanctions would have to say that right but but how does she do how did she do that\nAlisha well off and get the scripts and she will go to the actor and she'll tell them what's in the script and then she will work it out with them defining what they feel comfortable with talking to them\nAbout their boundaries about anything that they would like on that to help them feel safe so then go back to the director on the producers and see if she can work something out that everyone feels good about then when it comes to the day of filming\nShe is often standing within I shot of Dr um she is usually looking at the monitor to see how the scene is playing a so she's there to comment on the\nChoreography and she will help them protect themselves she'll tell them how to make things look more real without them having to do something that feels more sexual to them so it's about choreography the same way that we have fights being choreography\nWrote a HBO and it kind of makes sense is is leading the way on this or at least among the first because they got this reputation for doing a whole lot of sex do you suppose it's going to spread is there a movement now to get it the mushy coordinators and the broader spectrum especially given where we are in this society today with with me too and all of that\nYeah I think that's very likely to happen I Know David Simon said that he\nFrom from the from the water we should say road\nAbsolutely I he said he never wanted to work without and intimacy coordinator again and only she told me that her nonprofit intimacy directors international now that people know that she's working with a ... an olive HBO's
