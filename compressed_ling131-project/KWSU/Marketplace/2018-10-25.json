to government relationship\nAnd that needs to be respected when it comes spoke to the natural resource issues that tribes are involved in but really other issues as well\nMy opponent voted to weaken the violence against women act specifically to weaken the protections that native women would have on tribal land and this is a step in the wrong direction\nSo if I were I'm standing next to the president\nUh I Would um make it clear that the type of name calling that he uses to describe his opponents is unacceptable in a leader and we need to do better and we certainly can do better\nI'm

highlighted some of their forest health practices that are a model that I think the federal government should follow thank you thirty second\nYes first of all with respect to the violence against women act instead of reauthorized and yet it was cynically extended until just after the election so it will depend on who was in the majority in Congress as to what happens next\nAnd caffeine did
