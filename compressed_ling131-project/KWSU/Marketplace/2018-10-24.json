might not be back next year which sounds harsh until you realize that the average player in the national football league lasts just three point three years\nMarcellus why only lasted ten years on four teams in the NFL made it to a pro bowl and then found his way to ESPN and now Fox Sports in his retirement but the idea that he would have even make it to the pros to begin with seemed far fetched his new book about his life and career and what came after that\nIs called never shut up Marcellus finally thanks for coming in Oh thank you so much so about about this book a first of all agree totally fascinating I I have to ask you about the subtitle though okay life opinions and unexpected adventures of an NFL\nOutlier way since what are you in the NFL outlier menu blatantly for ten years you may get zillion dollars yeah I guess\nThat's not so unique but ah to get there was a unique experience coming from Columbia University or not the yellow brick road to the NFL is\nLet's go back further

three miles down the road in yeah in South central LA I did\nI'm born and raised in Compton south central LA right here in the heart of the city in the heart of a lot of gang activity or the drugs to poverty I decided to be more responsible with my talents and only had two which was academics in athletics\nAnd and size right I mean Europe physically gifted due to right yeah it's got to be thrown in there I'm not not my favorite story about you've grown up down there but uh maybe the most illustrative story is the first concussion you ever had was not a football field\nNo it wasn't I'm Crazy

on a park\nMy friends are we going to push the little man we don't put your little army so finally they pushed me author night flipping the air and in the air I think I'm just going to land in the sand and now I'm a take off running big boat or I saw it coming next thing I Know my grandmother's house big hole in my head nice ditches later and that was another childhood experience and the other day\nSo here we are now I mean you're somebody in the world of a football and media and entertainment they catch them courses that for every one of you who plays ten years gets out reasonably helpfully and has a career afterward\nThere are probably a dozen guys who don't who are done at twenty six and can't find their way through\nYeah and that's the sad part a ... degree if they happen if

it\nThese players get sold into the next thing you know they're in these football factories were full worthless degree to the real world and then there are three years in a league they may\nFour hundred thousand dollars a man which they blown day blown and then they're in the real world like which way is up so let's go from one tricky issue to another one the politicization of the NFL today with Colin Kaepernick and taking me and those protests\nYeah um I wouldn't have taken a knee if I were an active player but I certainly would have been in full support of the calls what would've Kurt

Would have caught a teammate or friend on every NFL team thirty two teams ambassadors you're the ... of the New York giants whoever that may be\nNow we have thirty two million dollars and not want
