TV you know they have a Nineteen billion views they have twenty nine million subscribers specific global children's entertainment ... kids love it they can't get enough they watch them over and over and over and over\nAll right so maybe I'm being naive here but I'm a you know back when the analogy you make in this piece is to PBS in public broadcasting in Sesame Street in children's television workshop from like fifty years ago now in in the American economy\nAnd the ostensible reason for all that was to educate not necessarily want a two year olds but\nYou know slightly older toddlers and and give them a leg up is that\nThe mission of of toddler YouTube and and true true TV is that what they're doing\nYou know I think right now they're in a transitional place they've banned entertainment they've been just trying to capture as much children's attention as they possibly can and now they realized that they've done that\nAnd they need to deliver them something better and so what I'm hoping is that this global phenomenon of all these video producers on YouTube will have a similar revelation and do similar work to create YouTube it's good for kids rather than just something that sets up their time\nWell so spit bullet for me do you think that's gonna work because you know not to make the American analogy on everything here but there were researchers and educators and and government regulators in some sense talking to the folks who are doing children's television workshop is there a sense that there's that infrastructure beneath what toddler YouTube is doing\nNot really on the other hand they can benefit from you know fifty years of research on children's television but the media environment the media business is obviously much different\nAnd the biggest difference is there's just YouTube basically to physicians where kids are going this is where the whole businesses and say YouTube itself would have to be the one that sort of maybe tip the scales for educational content within the algorithms that determine what people watch\nWhat do we know what do we think uh it's actually doing to the kids setting aside from it or whatever educational benefit that might have we know what being attached to our phones and our screens does to grownups what about the kids young kids\nWell I think you know the the worst possible impact is that essentially that kind of attention grabbing fast paced content and the ability to switch between those things very quickly maybe sending kids up to expect\nJuice kind of attention a lot and kids\nAlexis Madrigal he writes for the Atlantic his most recent piece is called raised by you got to watch what really pushing guy [noise]\n\n\n\nComing up a huge part of the music industry is the
