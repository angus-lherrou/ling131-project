Sunday requiring that publicly held corporations headquartered in the states include women on their boards this law is the first of its kind in the U.S we've got Jenna McGregor to talk about it she covers corporate governance for the Washington Post thanks for being here thanks for having me\nRun down and what this law is and who will be affected by it\nSo California Governor Jerry Brown it just signed into law a bill that lawmakers there have been trying to get through for a long time to actually require companies that have their principal offices in California to have\nWhat we'll start with at least one female director on their board\nDid do most sports include women already I mean how how unusual is it either to have women on board to not have women ...\nParticularly large companies most have a woman on the board large publicly traded companies but uh\nTheir numbers show that about twenty five percent of companies headquartered publicly traded headquartered companies in California do not\nHave any women and so they're trying to fix that issue through having a mandate of sorts it will grow over time over the next couple of years they're going to add\nTo it where it's not just one that you're required to have that depending on the ... the board they want you to have one two or three and really most companies are probably going to need to have three that are headquartered in California\nWhat happens if you're a companies headquartered in California but say your incorporated somewhere else does this still apply\nBut the big question here I said they have put through this bill but there are both business group in California some corporate governance experts including a former members of the FCC has said you know what this may not\nFly this may face some legal challenges because many many many companies are actually incorporated in Delaware with the state that has\nA little friendlier business environment and that yeah the so law has said those

female prosecutor there in the room um how much of this is about the parents and how much is about change in corporate governance\nWell I have seen the same question of whether\nFor deciding to sign it into law so what was this a way of making a statement of what the country has been engage in a major national conversation about yeah I'm\nThe issue of whether having more women on the board has any impact is is a good question there is a lot of research that shows it does have a good impact but it leads to either higher returns or better decision making are better price mergers yet\nThe question is how do you do it do you actually eat for choir then to do it do you have an incentive for them to do it do you do it through kind of public shaming [laughter] and so what what is the best approach to getting more diversity on the board or getting more diversity in a room full of any decision makers\nJenna McGregor from the Washington Post and you so much\nThanks for having me
