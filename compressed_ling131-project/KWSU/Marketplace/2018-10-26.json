companies rise real hard to personalize pretty much everything I get a lot of history stuff suggested some rom coms to to be honest but sometimes\nThe personalization gets a little bit complicated because there's a difference between stepping personalized and you tend to being profiled ... who covers Silicon Valley for wires you wrote about Netflix and what it knows about you and how it shows you what he knows about you and Josh walkman Brunner thanks for having me telling me how you came upon this story what'd you\nSure so earlier this month a writer named ... brown she posted some or or that Netflix had served her for a new movie called like fat and she posted this on Twitter so rather than the debt films pure white co star it's coffee grammar and now she saw a poster\nShowing two black side character to as as perhaps had had maybe twenty lines between nine pounds\nAnd brown and black and she asked other on Netflix users if they were experiencing the same phenomenon and she also along with it posted some other work that she'd seen for movies like love actually where she was shown black\nHigh character and he had a very small roles in film\nSo there's there's a part of it is creepy that Netflix is keeping an eye on us which we do kind of know about but also now they're doing this in a uh I get this is kind of a loaded term and they're doing that kind of a bogus way right\nWell the company's response was that you know they don't ask members about their race gender or ethnicity you said they can't use that information to personalize your Netflix\nStraight and and this particular phenomenon happen because last year they started drilling down personalization even to the level of the work that you're seeing in your Netflix queue\nThey're applying the algorithm to kind of inherently biased database right like Hollywood movies don't offer many parts to appeal of color and prominent roles so\nNetflix is here and they're just trying to get you to keep watching doing anything they possibly can but what you said is that they you know they should have anticipated this coming and the fact\nThat they can't just be candid about all of the proxies for race that exist in algorithms is just kind of frustrating because here it's it's actually pretty innocuous their algorithms say probably was just looking at hey can we get people to watch movies based on secondary characters you know they they might not even have put that in ...\nSecondary characters who go way and the first ten minutes of a movie or whatever so a couple of things about other number one Netflix is taking the time effort and energy to personalize their stuff down to the bone nail on your screen mhm which seems a lot of effort I suppose but I guess it works\nYou know once you automate that and you have machine learning doing it it's just kind of spending on it's on\nThe other part of this though is is we don't know what we don't know because Netflix keeps all the data extremely closely held\nExactly I mean say they didn't want to answer a question about these sensitive topics but they wouldn't even tell me okay well what about your viewing history are they cataloguing what are the factors that they're using um they didn't even feel comfortable sharing not I think they said it's like proprietary information\nIt's not just what you see on Netflix that algorithms get used for right\nThey are being used in many areas he even outside of tech companies there used to determine who gets access to alone they're used for hiring recruitment all kinds of very impactful areas of our lights on line\n[noise] the touched discouraged for wired most recently a about Netflix and its algorithms when wouldn't want you to watch because production thanks a lot
