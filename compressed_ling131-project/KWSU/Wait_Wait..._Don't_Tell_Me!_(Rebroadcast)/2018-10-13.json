said to myself oh maybe I'll Try out journalism and and so I I started taking political science courses and communication and I was like oh I think I'm going to be a diplomat\nAnd that's really hard to [noise]\nOn so then you know and then I thought it was like okay you know what I'm going to figure it out maybe law school who knows um and then yeah and then I kept on trying different things\nSo I got here and did you did you take a acting classes or did you just start auditioning like how to transition happened\nWell I went to performance art high school right on when I was a kid I mean when

what is the secret ingredient said\nTo be around women [laughter]\nHave every wouldn't be a woman [laughter]\n[noise]\nI you know from experience it's a really great environment you know it's funny 'cause people like would assume like the opposite ... you know how they brainwashed us in the past like catty women riding\nHis you know the ... the competition yeah yeah I mean I feel like I mean you can find that anywhere really but I think I mean I always have found myself very comfortable and groups of women and ... basis where it's like female run I mean I went to an all women's college\nBut this was definitely a progressive group and uh everyone really loved being there and everybody was really excited to make something not with unlike any other\nYeah and you know what I find very impressive and particularly admirable about you is that you are one hundred percent self made because growing up your parents and your brother were deported when you were just fourteen years old and you were forced to basically fend for yourself\nHow did you manage [noise] [laughter] yeah I mean I'm\nYou know I think I had a very clear I'm at a very young age but if that did happen I mean I did grow up with the fear of my family being separated that was always very present in our household and so I was just always sort of like an outsider look looking in you know actually because I was the only one in the family who\nHad it I'm very clear in my mind that whatever happened that I was going to continue going and I was going to be strong and I was going to find a way to succeed and and that doesn't mean I mean I didn't I didn't think oh I'm going to succeed as an actor or this or that I just wanted to succeed\nIn life I guess I just wanted to figure out a way to be happy and to and you know I figure I'll everything up and hopefully along the way help my family one day\nAnd in two thousand fourteen you wrote a very powerful op ed piece for the Los Angeles times about your brother your brother your parents deportation ha what was it about two thousand fourteen uh\nThat you decided it is now time for me to tell the story I ...\nI thought maybe my voice could be an asset\nYou're hot [laughter] and I'm way because\nEspecially because of the people the people who are I was hearing like on the news on and on different talk shows really didn't when they talked about immigration it really didn't think personal to me so I figured well how are these people representing my experience and\nThe experience of millions um I Know what this feels like I Know what family separation is so it's not really that easy it's not\nThat we need to have that our conversations about this and then I I decided okay I'll write something and see\nIf can move the needle in any way\nAnd what was the aftermath once that was published\nIt was it was like cats at a bag and I had to do all this work [laughter]\n\nSo I was like I'm so tired I'm like over here to rub it in all he would like nobody wants to give me a job [laughter] you know let them you know some drug dealers girlfriend on [noise] and and here I Am putting myself and it says you know do all this work on top of this\nWork yeah and it also led to obviously you deciding to write a book a whole memoir based on your life yeah called in the country we love my family divided\nAnd now you not only have this book but you've decided to publish it was being published your latest book is targeted towards a young adult audience yeah and that it is called my family divided one girl journey of home last and hope what is different about this version\nIt's just like an easier read like easier than already the easy book um money people come up to me all the time in your book I read it in one sitting at ease\nAnd there are the students that have been responding to the story so I wrote it for them really it wasn't intended for you an adult time [noise] so yeah that's why you found it easy\n[laughter] and now this memoir your story is being developed as a television series\nWell trying okay I'm In talks right now a developing 'em either theories or us down on I can take in many different directions but that's sort of like when I'm getting into right now animated series archer novels yeah\nYeah I Want to make it into a children's book actually I'm very interested in that and then you know the Dora the explorer does
