everybody had to get together on Monday to talk about what had happened I asked for it was and then I Love that yeah it's pretty great but you know like a lot of actors you had a struggling period right at the start right\nPlace at ... years and years the waitress chore I don't know ... million years um I rent telephone that various offices and dressed up like cookie monster at a wedding\nHall

an enormous cultural phenomena little change there's an for decades to come oh my God you're beta yeah\nOne of the things that we knew and we actually back in the day interviewed some of the actors in the show and one of the things that everybody would hear about is that every actor in the Sopranos was terrified that some day the David Chase or the other producers would say come here we got to talk to you\nAnd they let you know that you were gonna get washed or ... or your character they didn't actually kill any actors are\nOne of the guys who got killed and I will not say all of a sudden after that episode they started getting all these letters from Japan saying oh why did you can watch that one about uh which seems sort of unusual and after a period of time it was all traced back to the actor\n\nToo and\nHe tried he trying every credit so you went right from the Sopranos and you did this as well I don't know if his right from the spot as soon as ... as you did this new show on Showtime called nurse Jackie which I about a nurse who had a among other things a drug problem and various other problems\nHave you ever like wanted to just play a normal nice person so much mind

right\nPlaying for balance any of Melbourne, Australia\nMind that All right here we\nGo first question the tenor Jose ... demonstrated that he was destined to be an opera singer early on in life\nHow a when he sang happy birthday to five year olds party all the other children ... and the party was canceled [noise] be he sang so much at home and family got sick of it and made them singing the bathroom where they locked him in or see the sound he made when he got his first flu shot reportedly made the doctor give up medicine and become a poet [laughter]\nDo you have to be\nThe answer in fact is of course be the only thing in his family\nGot locked\n[noise] you\nMust have been excellent 'cause of course to add on to a legendary career alright nice questioned the great tenor Robert White said the greatest high notes that his career as it were happening in a surprising way which of these a bug flew in his mouth and write down his throat possibly loosening them up so we could reach the note\nBeing he accidently sat right on the fat ladies Viking helmet and let out the highest note he'd ever had you heard a car alarm going off in the upper houses parking lots that was
