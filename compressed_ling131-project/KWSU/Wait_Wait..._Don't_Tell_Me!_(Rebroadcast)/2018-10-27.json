beginning of your spongebob journey yes they're fine with me where\nYou were and what you were doing when you\nReceived the information that you had an audition for sponge Bob square pants\nI was I remember very clearly I was in my friend's dorm room at Vassar College\nI was yeah go Vassar brewers I don't know if you remember that was our mascot\nAnd uh I was sitting on a bean bag chair in a dorm room and like a like a cross for me was my friend's poster of all the faces that spongebob makes all those wacky faces and then he had a\nPlush sponge Bob Dole that lived on that in that year so I was like sitting next to it and I got a phone call\nAnd it was a casting director who had just seen me audition for Romeo and Juliet really randomly as part of an apprenticeship that I wanted to work out for the summer and they said we have this audition for you can't tell you what it is technically it's the title to Atlanta project but we think you might be the right shape for it\nThat hurt I when I heard a little bit but\nGotten over it but you didn't know what they were talking about it oh no they\nThey said that the name of chipper chip and just to we're going to send you a follow up email so I went back into the dorm with the guys I got this\nHigh like looked at the dollar and I looked at the poster I looked at my friends and I'm like oh she purchased a sponge Bob [laughter]\nUm that is a crazy coincidence it was it was really wild you go to the audition and you decide you're not going to do a sponge Bob impression is very distinctive high pitched kind of gig leave voice they are not going to do that you're just going to use\nYour voice right yeah that was like both I'm a conscious decision yes an artist and also a choice that I made out of fear and eight hours of preparation time sure uh [noise] I had never tried to do a sponge Bob impression\nI had a lot of friends who were great at during the last year and that was not me\nSo I stayed up you know working on my physical comedy routine until four in the morning on the quad\nAnd I just sort of like did the whole thing like this just like eat them but like a little bit more excited and um and the addition went pretty well but as I remember it Tina Landau the director at the end was like a great job awesome come back in and do the voice is pretty important [laughter]\n[noise] all the cool for cocoa\nYes you said you were you were sitting at Vassar you're sitting drama you yeah you got to print a ship for Romeo and Juliet did you know yeah I was actually cast in in the show\nOr in addition to the apprenticeship which was like a huge for me it was like going to be my first professional gig yeah\nI had to drop out because of a conflict with with sponge Bob uh [noise]\nWhich was like a surprisingly difficult decision because they were like well you got you know two weeks of this workshop or a full production of Shakespeare and I was like well I've been doing plays and I really love Shakespeare I've I've been doing to Shakespeare should since I was a little kid in DC and so that that was something that I'd always wanted to do and I talk to my professor\nAt the time and he said Shakespeare will always be there but if you pass up the opportunity to work with Tina land out you're going to regret it\nSo I think Tina for being the reason that I chose the obvious paths\nShakespeare is always going to be there but spongebob is here right now right now right now his moments so this show is incredibly physical I mean you are doing gymnastics or jumping in the air for what seems like over half\nOf that show I mean it's intense so what kind of training did you go\nYeah but yeah I I've learned so many skilled over the course of the six years I I learned things like juggling first thing that got cut and um I learned a great job right now I can juggle place so that sort of cool wow um yeah and and you know I went to train with contortion asked for six months um yeah\nAnd yeah when you see the show you do this incredible back band that makes everyone gas\nYeah I'd say that I can I get thank you to a you know Jonathan notes and yeah\nMy contortion teacher I mean they have I was really aware of the demands going into it and I didn't want to not be ready yeah oh yeah it was a lot and you mentioned that playing spongebob has actually affected your outlook on life it is made you a more optimistic person totally\nTotally yeah I mean it's hard not to I I mean I I have the privilege of you know being the sponge\nTwo and a half hours it shows a week um when did you first notice that [noise]\nDon't know it's been a gradual increase yeah I think I only started to acknowledge it when people started asking me if I feel like a lot like sponge Bob yes and like at first I was like [noise] no [noise]\nUm but yeah I mean like\nAnd I I'm really proud that I Do because I think that's shockingly sponge Bob had these qualities that I aspire to he he's ... he's like a little naive maybe but he's he's very optimistic\nAnd he's able to put his love of his friends end up his community in front of everything else and when the world is crumbling around every one\nPeople tend to be taken over by their fear and buy\nTheir hatred and their ability to scapegoat others and what ... Bob is able to do is say no I'm not going to do that I Love my community and I love these people I'm not going to let this town destroy itself you know I get to save the world from health every night and that's like especially these days [laughter] [noise]\nAh that feels really like a frequent\nAh\nAll right are you ready for an asked me another challenge yes I Am a fantastic of course you are who eats and we actually found a pretty amazing opponent for you please welcome the Tony nominated book writer a sponge Bob square pants the musical Kyle jak every body [noise]\n\nKyle thanks for being on the show as well happy to have you\nI think I've been involved almost six years okay here's\nWhat is the evolution of the story of sponge Bob square pants the musical what is the evolution of this story has\nIt changed from day one yeah it has I mean we knew okay here's the challenge writes about on the TV they're eleven minute episode yes Broadway show you maybe where nine eleven minutes long just a little longer a little longer so we had to figure out like how do we take that\nCrazy fast paced show and create a show that can fill in the evening and has a kind of steaks\nThe emotional states that are going to make us want to sit there for an evening\nSo pretty early we sat on the idea there was going to be the end of the world which are pretty high stakes yeah right right and then the exact a version of end of the world's changed a bunch but we were kind of always on that idea that it was going to be Armageddon meets sponge Bob\nSpongebob his fellow inhabitants of bikini bottom are threatened by a volcano that it's going to destroy it and people are freaking out they look ... fish are perfectly\nFish fish are free to clarify the I just found myself in every single one of those fast you're at and they ... who is who is a mammal and there is a subtle thing where everyone ends up turning on the mammal\nAnd even spray paint a sign that says mammals go home\nWhich of course it seems like a comment on the current world around us and I'm just wondering when did this to enter the script\nWell you know interestingly enough it's been in there a long time in the show Sandy this girl is the only land mammal right there are aquatic mammals there's a whale but she's the only land mammal thank you I like you I I don't mind being outside it's perfectly honest [laughter]\nSo anyway we always thought wrote a story about people turning against each other dealing with fear the idea of scapegoating somebody it just you know that's what happened yeah so she as the outsider seemed like you know really clear way to tell that story sadly the world has really caught up and I think it's\nFelt even more relevant than it did even when we did in Chicago a couple of
