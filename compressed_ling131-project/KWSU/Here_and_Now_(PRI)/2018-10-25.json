now\nThank you and I want to start with just what's going on right now what everybody's paying attention to which is ... what do you think he's going on in the stock market at the moment\nA dollar more sellers and buy a strong [laughter] question or two more seriously it's essentially the movement of long term interest rates moving higher\nAnd concurrently wage rights are being pressured\nBut mainly interest rates and it's creating this a fairly significant adjustment it serves ... now the unexpected\nBut whenever you get to the spread between the five year treasury note on the thirty year bond opening up which is what has happened you have a significant impact on stock prices\nBut not a big surprise to anybody that the fed has been saying for a long time that that interest rates were eventually going to go back up again why do you think the market is reacting like this\nWell I think it's basically the combination of not what the fed is doing which remember short term interest rates and it's what the market itself is doing\nFor the ten year treasury note and say that's already in the treasury bond very moved up significantly and that's where the major business decisions are determined\nOut at that scale although it's ten years Fifteen Years out not overnight which was largely whatever comes from\nIs there anything that the government can do about this either through monetary policy or a fiscal policy or should they do anything or just let things happen that they do\nWell we're in the process of adjustment and we've had interest rates in this country after the lowest level in American history\nWe're now coming out of it and gradually adjusting\nSo long as long term interest rates were just I sort of as a critical factor continue to rise the pressure of what's going to be down would on stock prices but it's very difficult to say where it goes from here because the pundits have been right after the time\nI was in the Federal Reserve and elsewhere for

percent of it nationwide and and that's changed dramatically over the past couple of years the oysters an indicator species right at the Keystone feces\nIf you have a healthy oyster population that scientists will tell you guess while you're going to find out\nYou've got healthy fishy about healthy crabs you got healthy shrimp\nAnd so when you see this\nChallenge with oysters guess what you're

in our fiercely protective of it and they include scientists and researchers states [noise]\nWe've retreated to the river keepers office of votes have had to be called off the bat whether Dr Felisa Coleman director of Florida state's coasts and remind her colleague\nDr Sondra brook and write ogles recently retired from the state's department of environmental protection join us I start by asking Dr column and that question we started with why do we care about this\nI'd say the most spectacular fishery collapses have occurred worldwide on rivers that have had tremendous re diversion of water\nBecause that that water bringing all its nutrients is not coming down into the salad needed water and coming down anymore so that's really important component I think that's overlooked well and talk more about that Dr brook because it's not just that it's encouraging the fish grows\nIt's discouraging the growth of the creatures that might pray on things like always just like the conch which like the saltier water\nYes when the balance of salt and fresh changes then different things happen the problem with salt water that encourages these marine predators touch it always to drill and crown call\nAbout these oyster journals that sounds like a horror film duct duct to tell us more they latch onto the oysters and they like come out face\nThat down on an oyster and then all of a sudden they always to have this scrape scrape scrape and eventually they'll scrape through the shelves and tickets for buses than and basically consume the always to from within and there's not a whole lot you can do about it it is rather efficacy\nI'll check it out on YouTube [laughter]\nIt's like a bad movie what else can be done I mean some people wonder why the bay wasn't just shut down so that it could replenish let's start with\nAnd a an ecosystem because if we don't\nAddress the problems with the ecosystem if\nWe're constantly reacting one of the things that happened in the wake of the oil spill was at the fisherman were allowed to go out and harvest all the oysters the fear was that this bill would come in and kill the cells in a couple of years later and there was no birds stock left there to re populated think about the phone\nOffer refuge for a number of juvenile species that live inside the crevices they help protect it from storm surge you can't have this industry\nWithout that resource you can't have good sea grass beds without that the oyster race or she can't have high water quality you've got to restore all those things\nBut you have to do it and a deliberate fashion one of the problems with a day over the last few decades has been\nReaction reaction to the oil spill reaction to a water flow planting coach out there and that culture is that oil stir shell what they larval oysters settled on but\nDistributing it without a plan you might as well be kept seeing it all ended when what would you recommend\nI mean we haven't even mentioned climate change and the drought that has been a part of the fresh water coming in from the river drying up ... you say it has to be deliberate what does it have to be\nTheir particular types of research that could be done that could\nRelatively quickly in the next couple of years make some very good decisions about how we restore the bay the fisherman really understand what native but they want their livelihood restored so there's a tendency to go for whatever looks like the quickest effects closing the best probably not a terrible idea\nAnd I think you would find fishermen that fully support that well Dr ... research and really committed effort instead of throwing short term solution what a bank desalination plant I think there are\nMore problems and I'm ... and ... you know they had the drought back in two thousand some and nine and since then we've had decent rainfall but the all the time and come back\n[noise] usually want a system crashes it's not just one thing but there are also other factors in play you know the the ... they're not as high as they used to be we don't know where the lobby\nComing from or what does the topography of the bay looked like you know how much of the coach ... where it is it's all these questions that will help us figure out a way of making a comeback\nHe this is so interesting because after Sandy Reid did a lot of reporting on people who want it to bring the oyster beds back to New York harbor it used to be filled with voice their beds as a barrier against that storm coming in you know pass the statue of liberty is Lucian agriculture we're all shaking your head no\nThe environment of the day when I say I would I Would support support it would be for the community for the out of work ... to hedge their bets\nIt's an economic and ate it and said it'll provide some economic relief that it doesn't fix the ecology\nPossible or watching epileptic color bay and what happened here the fishing industry here in the spot maybe leave these people\nAre so tied to this area I failed her that they can't find if you can't bring it back when I Can't do anything that reality I think probably are not going to be able to do ... and the wild for

way people think about those FEMA trailers but there seems to be a you know some slow down in the process they say they need to work with local government they can't just come in there and say here we come we're putting these trailers here\nThe local governments need to ask for it and of course those local governments are are still putting themselves back together and so I think that's why we're seeing sort of this as low risk by\nTheir also shelter is of course yeah\nWell it will end by the way we see people all over the place in their blue T shirts they're working very hard you spoke with Michelle chestnut though she was staying in a shelter in a local high school I just want to listen to how\nWe say we're in charge I mean it was just like all the windows busted out and buy\nAll the trees come down and landed right beside the church though yeah I'm I have and her house was destroyed a brother in law is houses is Roy ...\nAnd home or in the panhandle people might be picturing in Miami Beach and thinking these are second homes are beach homes not\nRight this is a part of Florida where we have a lot more\nRural people a lot more low income people and so these either even people who maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are\nHomes that have been handed down for generations and said since they have no mortgage and they really don't have room in their budget for insurance they don't have that insurance which will make this recovery even more difficult they don't have that way chipped to begin rebuilding their homes\nWill and rebuilding with what because with so many things down a incomes have been cut another big challenge is joblessness that's looming 'em and you heard from Nikki Gilmore a Walmart manager in Mariana who said people showing up for work even though they have really trying circumstances let's hear\nWe're getting some permanent called one of ... the a lot\nAnd so I've got like off at us as Americans we call him Dr seuss loss is allowed\nAfter three days here\nThrough smiling and Grayson\nDescribe gravity has a job to recover\nRules because\nWhen he says we got air he means is he conditioning air conditioned right how are people getting by they have no income I think that it's\nTough I'm hearing from people who who are very concerned about it Gilmore had opened his door and it wasn't open to the public but he would allow in his employees to come in and just help with the cleanup process that they could get a paycheck many of these people are living paycheck to paycheck there is some unemployment like specifically storm related unemployment assistance available through the state\nBut again not difficult for a fisherman who maybe don't have a good way of tracking what their income has been and so they don't have a good way of applying for that assistance\nYeah well running water mostly back in some places it's not drinkable communications as we have discovered are still pretty spotty um it's just really ... I have to say it's just\nRemarkable to see the trees uprooted everywhere even hear it you know inland Tallahassee roofs off high school fifty miles inland it's really a quite humbling\nA F. A. S. S. W. F. as senior news producer of Reagan McCarthy thanks so much for sharing your reporting and I think yeah\nWe've been talking about housing even though I was able to return to homes and it's unbelievable again will have pictures that here now dot org are having trouble hearing loss could Bentley went to the coast and brought back this look\n[noise]\nLooks like a hurricane went through yesterday not two weeks ago cars boats are turned on their side strewn across the street from the bond homes are split wide open there's debris everywhere but for those able to return to their home just part of the Florida Panhandle as one big construction sites\nTroy Brian's watches as workers tear the shingles after through there and\nThen all of a shame I just had the new the new route but all last September\nBryant and his wife ... bought this beachfront property and moved here from Georgia earlier this year they stayed in a hotel in Mariana Florida during the storm returned two days later to find their new home intact but severely damaged\nWell when I first drove up I thought well that's a you know the garage doors were my old but I thought well that's not so bad [noise]\nAnd then you walk outside to the back door the garage and it opened up and then that's just what you're saying right here [noise] butter devastation [noise]\nI had a white picket fence that we had just built all around the front of the house there's part of it and the back part of it in the garage\nHouse right there\nUsed to be right there\nBrian says that house it's forty\nFeet from where it used to say [noise] Janice an Alan Cronin flip a few blocks from the beach they were on vacation in Tennessee when the storm hits and when they came back they found four feet of water swept through the door [noise] they also saw whole houses lifted off their foundations and swept into the streets by the storm surge and high winds\nSecond locked most album\nWill have some sort of damage in horse racing there's was pushed up already gotten kind of total to know\nAnd there was a house in the street and I knew how to it\nCatty corner that belong\nAnd so when the storm surge came up and started flooding of course and it just\nAnd of course you say our neighbors car\nThe Cronin are spending their new retirements repairing their house by hand living out of camp or in their backyard they're determined to stay but Allen Cronin says this area will never be the same\nDay the large percentage of these homes that were owned by grandma\nGrandma and grandpa was not going to rebuild and your\nGrandma and grandpa was from satellite\nI keep in mind that a third to half\nHouse has been here we're actually built you before Nineteen Seventy and they were literally not built to any hurricane go they were built for\nAnd people have lived in them for years and\nNow they're not going to live um in in your hand in ...\nSounds Norton rode out the storm and carts house\nI was confident on a category one and two but then after I realized it was going to be a three or four it was too late\nAnd luckily we survive [noise]\nToday they're helping their neighbor clear down trees from his yard Clark says Michael was a historic storm\nThere's a history here uh of even when I started school here in in elementary school there's a book called the great time for the city was destroying three times one so far\nI watched by yellow fever and wants to buy a title wife which was really a hurricane soda cap and this has been before but it'll come back what you say that I just know the people who come back and I'm Sorry that\nYou're already building well yeah I've got three first comment I've got two people come in to straighten some of the messages out so yeah we uh what do you think it really\nHad anything to change or for whatever I don't think at a time is am I going to be more creative ... we can say more at the stars at night and now you know we had to have any trades before in the yard we can see this happening right now and they all the stars that are going to take a lot of work to get get it back together already\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

[laughter] um but these things are thousands of years old so they've been shifted\nIf they're in place and not currently excavated and that's really why we\nI've not seen the letter day for the better part of a dozen years we've we've made it vulnerable and so we covered this with tarps stand by the whole thing and we we got off awful lot\n[noise] and so they continue the work that was started by an angel devoted his life to saving the history beneath Florida soil and found this site when a sewer pipes was laid\nThe original work was done by the time state archaeologist Calvin Jones just along the sidewalk outside the lodge in Nineteen Ninety four and that's what some of the most important earliest fines were made\nCounting Jones isn't he the one who got a wheelbarrow of loan delivered to his home\nHe's the one who realize that there was some ancient tool in that who said wait a second yeah he yeah the Jackson has and he's the one who said wait a second this dirt and more than dirt is part of this ancient burial site you know here\nThey had a delivery of dirt and within the ... there were artifacts\nThat is archaeologist Barbara clause of the Florida public archaeology network and we've traveled to the place where Calvin Jones got his loan and realized it held treasures it's now the lake Jackson Mountains archeology state park in Tallahassee\nBeautiful carpet of long needing to grass covered hills fries like the facts of green elephant one bigger than the others [noise] okay we walked across\nThat vast lawn and there it is I mean how how high near would you say this mountain\nThis is the tallest up the southern mountains it is thirty six feet tall\nThe mountain or built basket by basket load of dirt and let's just backup\nWhat exactly is the mound this site is actually part of what's called the southeastern ceremonial complex which is the south eastern region version of the Mississippi in culture known by many as announced builders\nOver time they would do these mount and their leader would live on top of them now and in a hot when that person packed they would then be hurt or buried in the mountains and their home would be burned and then they would cap it off with more soil\nAnd then the next leader would live on top of it to overtime became popular and holler and you can actually see the different layers oil if you were to kind of cut this mound and half you would see evidence of that you'd see the charcoal from the burn holes you'd see the burials in the mountains\nSplit us climbed the mountain and didn't feel kind of [noise] I don't know you're walking on someone's funeral pirates that\nIt's a place that you\nThe definitely a very respectful kind of foreboding place\n[noise] I feel that but we are going to climate stairs to the top of it as a as a leader would've done hundreds of years ago so here we go [noise]\n\nOr their native peoples who are direct descendants of the people who lived here said\nDescendants of the people who live here where the Appalachia Indians that were here during the time of the Spaniards arrival there are still living descendents today most of them live in Louisiana and come over for educational events and things like that\nSo we are not climbing the the wouldn't stairs up\nThe mound um which is covered with wildflowers it's actually quite pretty [laughter] I Know there's concern about how these ancient site to might have been impacted by what was the third largest hurricane you know in the country's history but I'm thinking since the year one thousand ADD\nThese mouths and we're right on top now these mountains have whether a winning a lot\nYeah I think the biggest danger to the mound would be trees falling over because they take their root ball with them and with that of course they take part of them now and then you have an open place where rainwater can wash away parts of the mountains here we are ready on top\nOf the smell and we have all this growth so the leader of a community would get higher and higher and higher above the people I'm looking now on the big long where they'd all be living\nThis strategically placed over here to our east we have a lake Jackson I always tell people when you're looking for archaeological sites you looked for your basic needs food water and shelter there are others like similar to that throughout the south east all the way up through the Mississippi Valley up and to Ohio and even when they were excavating your chest and\nThey were finding copper breast plates ornate copper best place we don't have copper and Florida\nSo it was evidence of trade with other places\nUnderstanding this mound when it was excavated there would be a family there was a dog at one point\nThey've found women the John one child I Believe he was about eleven years old and yes there was a dark burial\nWhy is it so important is again a thousand to Fifteen hundred a community that lived here before the soda came through what what's it what does it mean to you\nI just cannot imagine the level of complexity and organization requests", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "25"}
