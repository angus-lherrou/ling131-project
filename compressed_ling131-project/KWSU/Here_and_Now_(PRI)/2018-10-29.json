in town goes to use the gym or to to meetings that that was reopen today but there's also\nPeople just feeling like places that they've always assumed were safe\nMaybe aren't safe anymore and and there were people talking about um how they're going to change their behavior if at all about vowing not to change their behavior not letting this attack change their way of life\nAnd he's just got to be a city in shock um for a six were wounded on Saturday is still in the hospitals do we know their status\nOr that people keep talking about the the two of the of the worshipers who were wounded in are in critical condition planning to life at the gathering last night uh one of the rabbi ... identified Daniel measure uh Seventy years old a squirrel hill who's a nurse in it and I'm a I'm\nI'm and

community wants to try and help\nA lot of people saying about the two police officers uh from what I think still hospitalized for wounded who confronted the shooter at the joy the synagogue is he was leaving 'em and off for wounded\nYeah I mean there's been an outpouring of gratitude towards all of the first responders and you see police now on on corners all over the city or outside of a synagogues in public places and a lot of people just stopping by to show their appreciation these guys are they rushed towards someone who was armed with\nWhat we now know we're we're three three

eleven killed six\nAnd they're eating it reflects an increase in hate crimes across the country jak Rosen is president of the American Jewish Congress jak words fail you know we're so sorry about this ruined his community but has been in the back of your mind you know what were you thinking when you heard about this attack\nBy first thought was this is a\nBrutal anti Semitic killing tax not only in the Jews but Americans and our values and the shock of it all was Jews have been living in America are comfortable it's accepted in all communities around the country\nSee changed since the fifties and sixties and in the anti Semitism bigotry against Jews and many minorities and here we are again one more time\nOr the ugliness not only pop to the surface does periodically\nBut it seems to grip a good number of people in America [laughter]\nWell uh ... let's talk about the climate in which it occurred to make up about two percent of this country's population the FBI data says they account for about half the country is when they just hate crimes\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents and twenty seven teams five times more than the previous year have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two three years we see more anti Semitic acts Nazi symbols of Jewish cemeteries are schools this act on Saturday is quite a shock to the community and to America it seems to\nAnd you know we only the ... the gathering there and Pittsburgh thousands of people came out I Hope you're feeling that\nSupport from across the board and yet we hear the President's Day in his first remark it's hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing except you're saying that you are also aware of a rising incidents\nDo you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday\nThat maybe at the very least you know small consolation but\nThere there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize so political leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any\nMajor changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe a ... [noise] those that have had been spewing out some of this viral language you know politicians closes who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and\nMaybe that will send a message in ...\nHave the microphones most important political leaders of president he has a bully pulpit as the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from other parties but it also has to go down to you know our\nRepresentatives in Washington are mad governors and mayors of you know it's a local issue and if we can mobilize loud voice to make sure that they understand that this is not the American way\nThan Americans won't accept it they'll go to the to the polls that necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that's where it has to begin as\nWell I actually have a hearing the opposite from the president has been\nFor a while we know that the government in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist rant that with her by the marching white nationalist in Charlottesville in August is plenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line these white nationalist a supremacist Nazi\nAbsolutely believe and foment the thinking that carries are pulling the strings somehow behind policies they don't like let's listen to these marches retired to hear that like to listen to the market in charge now\n\n\nIt sounds on the documentary to put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he originally the shooter was allegedly shouting in in a God that had to be tearing\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston\nAnd other attacks I think Americans are already conscious of the wrong time being set in America I Know everybody speaking about the president having a big responsibility in this because of you know his views and his political rhetoric we should all be hard to let him know that we don't accept that in America\nBut it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make\nI was just happened to be watching Clinton sharpening show no TV yesterday\nShots and NBC yeah\nDiscussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry is hatred that he shows showing you the wrong tone has been setting you said to myself what about fire cat had\nA you're speaking of Louis Farrakhan leader of the nation and\nYou know he just a few weeks ago said the Jews are Tom writes why and she was speaking out against him is that because you're a Democrat and Republican but our political leaders should also be speaking out against\nA little more responsible you know he has to since he has the biggest microphone she's going to have a you know live with the fact that he's the one they talk about the most but we shouldn't forget other parties all leaders don't just get a pass\nOr in the mail President Trump said that they were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville and some permission effort as much as I don't think\nThat you you talk about Nazis and the all white and Americans I just don't think the comparison makes any sense to us Americans\n... and president as American Jewish Congress thanks so much and again for ... a lot in your

finalist for the national Book Award for fiction but secret Nunez is exquisite novel the friend is about suicide it's also about the writing world with the author says is a sinking raft with too many people trying to get on\nAnd it's about a dog a harlequin great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together to goodness spoke with us last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together and to the famous story and one was about uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise] my experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing\nAnd uh I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and friendly O'Connor and Kafka and\nTreating us like gods and we respond by treating them like things\nThat is a quote from Jay and ... say from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these not just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the narrative apartment his tail is lowered like a beast of burden\nWhat do we know about whether dogs grieve\n[noise] we do know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know that we can't explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more and\nAnd uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to take in the dog but once she has him and she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving it just like her own and that and draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other and he'll now\nI remember I had to put a little dog sleep once and a person came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I\nI thought what seems odd but I Am sides meat yeah cats you can't say for sure that that would happen well when the when the shots started an injection to you know put him to sleep the other dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and peaked over the top of that to say\nYes anyone noticed you're killing a dog here you know fascinating they and then he did more and afterwards\nI as I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs heads because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have fought to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean there's chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog because you presume it's like old yell or\nYour present okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog is going to happen but you go with your narrator to other parts of her life when he was thinking there\nShe has a life outside of the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides to take care of that is a dog I mean he's he's her whole emotional lives during this period\nSomebody asked for the party argue the woman who\nIs a big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a talking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know we do have a person\nWho in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain riders and certain books and certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she's trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life at people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow [noise] all along the way I I kept thinking I should Google especially group of this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties in California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all the lead atrocities in what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYeah since they did have cycling fanatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think um need a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen and to the child is having reading difficulties\nThe dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou will to talk about people we talked about the site but you don't talk about people who weren't dying their throats because of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide [noise]\nBoy could be boats or maybe the friend in the narrator\nYeah and what about you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nMy my ... my married her really does Mitt isn't something I definitely share with my married her she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally\nAnd you don't dominate cats you dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she sent a they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that that to a cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet that can live without me she just much happier with the idea\nThat her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas\nThis dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend yeah\nDogs can be unbearably poignant she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alex furlough who wrote the definitive essay on her cat dying and the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to\nPenn on her head as they do you have\nHer only solace is that she is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen wake her up when she had gone oh\nYes that's that's very moving [noise]\nWell and how was this book is called the friend from secret newness and took it I didn't have to ask you read is about writers and writing in the community and the teaching of it um can you give us one tip for those who ah wanna wrestle the story to the ground\nAdvice that I really like is the simple don't flinch\nI say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among my students spoiled at least in a draft\nBecause they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have that ... really good experience they have very strong feelings about it but when they get to writing it down they get scared and they flinch and they pull away from it and that you know makes it not as good as story as it could be\nWell I Would say if anybody wants to see how you could write a book about a dog that for the longest time in the book isn't really about a dog and then suddenly it all about a dog and you know it was such a punch\nPick up the friend um and how much this is you you've told interviewers this isn't my writing class [laughter] you know I'm not that frustrated with student riders but it's a suicide maybe someone you didn't know because we read the germ of this when people who you knew who are contemplating suicide\n[noise] one of the reasons why I did want to to write this book was because there were several\nWeek or even next year but it was something that he started at started thinking about and thinking that that it is actually what would happen and in fact I I was writing this and one of those friends didn't commit suicide in fact\nFunding for here and now comes from that weren't greed or the ... where I could

law for years and tell us why\nWe wanted it to be basically a basic understanding about mental health signs and symptoms and to know you have support from the community\nWell so what are some of the the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess as you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching\nWhat they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans are best curriculums to put forward\nHow would that be different for a national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural areas suburban area in the city not that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states\nBut just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health

cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about more openly so that also has to take into into place too and also school history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to\nTranspose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we do do in response\nIs we were able to create a resource center a school mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the state department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a you know best practice lesson plans so\nPeople can go to our website and look and see that there are lesson plans out there dedicated to elementary school to middle school and to high schools\nYou got a teacher training there and other tools so willing people are hearing out out or the sample like let's say you decided to implement it in grade school what might a specific part of a curriculum day and then what might Wendy in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school especially early on kindergarten first grade second grade is just about things like feelings from about\nSadness and happiness and just general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially the very early age\nBut this idea of talking about feelings get fellow thing an emotional awareness so that when trouble comes has the teen years approach maybe somebody's got the tools to deal with it and it's ...\nWhere where buildings sort of like the the structure now for an individual to have that that emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building in a progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness nominee\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people live with a mental health condition in the U.S that less than half get treatment do this and I also funnel people to wield treatment as opposed to education and that you know they've got the dish and there are teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects raise kids\nTeachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nI think what we say in response to look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want teachers to go and talk about\nHere is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want teachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma talk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues\nAnd we hope that as more and more these discussions going on and people are realizing T educators families that you know this is just a normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people will be much more open about talking about it\nThat's currently many CEO of a nonprofit
