I think the cleanest question has been pools\nOr by the Turkish president he said to the Saudis okay usually I had that decides he joined us jump out just showed she left the consulate prove that they

auto insurance available at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto\nYear and now with less than three weeks until the mid term elections many are wondering if the polls are correct and Democrats will make big gains in the house or if like in twenty sixteen there's a lot more Republican enthusiasm than it's being reported\nBarry ah it's not very prosperous fraying at the edges and has been hurting for a long time [noise]\nAnd combing through a vote in the three critical swing states Pennsylvania Michigan or Wisconsin I discovered loser and county which is a traditionally democratic county hadn't voted Republican since Nineteen eighty eight for Bush senior\nPresident Obama want it to tighten resident Obama\nWon it twice but its surged in the other direction for Trump and he wanted by twenty points building up such a margin in this one county that it was sixty percent of his victory margin for the state of Pennsylvania so without this one county or he wouldn't have wanted to state or perhaps the presidency\nAnd you profiled twelve people in this book how did you find them well I went\nDown initially poking around and you do what a journalist do you go to community leaders and a newspaper editors talk show host and learn who the Trump voters were and start talking to them and one person a region to another\nI ended up interviewing a over the months a about a hundred in depth but settled on twelve a who stories I decided to tell and I think that this is a window or a deep dive if you will into the Trump vote and that\nAt least more than half the country remains shocked at a candidate is unusual was Trump got elected and there's a hunger to know more about how it happened and\nAnd you talk to a number of people who all kinds of different reasons for supporting Trump you you you've dipped into many different views of him one of the people that you spoke with Tiffany cloud\nTold you that Trump's simple related ... speak like huge big league or big league may have turned up voters in other parts of the country but it helped him connect with people in Lewes aren't county but I think people\nMost of their vote for president on the extent to which they can relate to them on a human level a likeable they are I think that that is in the end more important than where they stand on a variety of issues and\nI think the people that I settled on a the generally like Trump on most issues\nBut really liked his style they just like she's a his mocks\nStorm and I'm six or to the elites\nAnd they did not feel that he was being condescending toward them that he was talking down to them no on the contrary\nThey felt heard and listen to and felt that Hillary was talking down to them especially with her now infamous remark calling them the deplorable soon [noise]\nOne of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying\nWas not what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talk to people here in loser and county who you know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would here is like not actually going to build the wall but he's going to he's going to beef up the wall\nYeah the interesting they talked about the importance of deep coding Trump saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him to literally by merely covering\nOr what he said we would get into lively discussions about this sort of someone that's the press his job candidate says something and the press is supposed to report it and they said no no you really making too much of a ... who out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable [noise]\nWhat about religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump\nIt still predominantly Catholic not majority so there's a rising evangelical population\nTrump's evangelical phone was off the charts he carried a eighty percent of evangelical vote so I I talked to I'm a woman for whom Trump was literally sent by God\nShe believes that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction\nAnd does she feel like he's delivered she does\nHe's appointed evangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical they're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business\nAs essentially much ado about nothing that he's been married three times they don't care for them the the most important issues\nJust the overall sense of the place uh right now in twenty eight team this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is you you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area\nThe opioid crisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county [noise]\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict I'm the ripple effect is a widespread and uh I was at the county coroner\nDown there and he is uh just overworked and a thinks that it's an enormous problem and just trying to raise public awareness about it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county\nAnd young people are leaving as a brain brain there's not a lot of opportunity beyond\nMaintenance and I'm working in warehouses minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any better under Trump\n[noise] maybe at the margins are the unemployment rate has gone down in the county that has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign\nHe hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really sabotaging Obamacare and there is no neither Trump or the Republican Party has come up with an alternative plan he said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first or eight years\nGoing up the budget he filed in February or a shows a seven trillion dollar increase so you know Republican Party doesn't seem to care but that's not what about these voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able to do they don't seem to really care and the final analysis because\nThey just like Trump I think it's it's personality over ... and everything else\nYou think that the Democrats are connecting now with the people of Lucerne county I remember speaking to the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore who said you know they they didn't even try to win a place like Michigan or in the last election they didn't come here the way that Trump did um there's been\nWell they certainly did and within twenty sixteen and I think they would do well to listen more to Democrats a lot of the people that I talked to were Democrats a but felt that the party had left them rather than they are leaving the party\nAny thoughts on what might happen in the midterms\nWell if I had to guess I Would think the uh the so called blue wave I don't know how big it will be but I think probably big enough for the Democrats to retake the house but not the Senate\nThen by the junior one of the things I really liked about this book is that you gave us a glimpse in to the minds of many people who voted for Trump but\nDid so with respect for their views and I feel like a lot of the um reporting even on people in the middle of the country that's coming from reporters and and and others on the coast tests to look down on on that you didn't do that here well thank you\nFunding for

schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school in Manhattan which began to group the few minority students in the same home room so they'd have a place where they felt less like the other here's director fill a cat and\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nBut the parents of some of the minority students said it smelled of segregation and they worry that gave their kids the feeling of being left out so the school ended the policy our question is it the right thing to a group African American or Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school\nWe turn to Dr Beverly Tatum she's the author of the best seller why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria she's also former president of Spelman College in historically black college for women\nVegetative or the director of the little red school have said they're revisiting that maybe it should have been more structured but then it was very well intentioned your thoughts [noise] um I think it was well intentioned\nAnd certainly there's a lot of evidence to suggest that there is value to give\nBlack kids time together sometimes that time together it's called affinity grouping not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful talk about what is happening\nFor these teenagers because as you write in your book\nPlaying in the sand box with kids that look different from them and then something happens in high school was happening\nOne of the things that's happening is the changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty they start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest\nThat a black boys in school in particular I'm more likely to be disciplined for similar behaviors and also girls\nExperiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girl and having space to talk about that is not a bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing\nThe stereotypes that we see of black women are imposed on them and so they might develop some oppositional behavior explain that sure well\nIf I Am a young African American students and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person and a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is\nI don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know the black kids think doing well in school is acting white but that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated\nBecause their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school and if you are in a school like that\nThe honor students are black but if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like than you are likely to think doing well in school being in that honors track is so called acting why\nIt's such a vicious cycle because very often the kids are in those lower trash maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a higher tractors a lower expectation\nBut what ends up happening is this sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in\nAnd in fact tracking often does result in re segregation with in racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about the kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings perhaps because they are less well prepared and maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation\nKids who test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed in those upper track you know the so the little red school so they looked at research it was probably yours in your book\nTo read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores still not be placed so what do we do\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support without making it look like\nSegregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations this brings us to the Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counseling for education opportunity program Nineteen Ninety four\nThe notion of bussing kids from the inner city from troubled spots in the inner city out to the suburbs very good schools but all white school it was kind of a failure at first talk a little\nBit about that and then what sure so most of the children who are traveling from Boston and to the suburban schools are black or Latino\nAnd often there's a sense of not really belonging they are not part of the local community and so when superintendents of these programs look at the performance of the black kids in particular\nThey often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing there's also may not um echo but you write another anecdote about a young black girl who was in a school um majority white\nAnd a teacher saying are you going to the dance kid doesn't want to say how we're going to get to the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we live in the city but she doesn't say that\nAnd to teach you get so frustrated that she won't say she's going to the dance that she then ended up paying something racial she says oh come on you people love to dance which adds to the racialized moment that the young girl was feeling\nExactly that teacher who made that comment was well intentioned but nonetheless projected a stereotype and it made the students feel even more like she didn't really belong in at school yeah but there was a program back in the nineties I was very involved\nAnd I wonder if the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one period a day for the kids to meet together to talk about issues related to academic performance academic achievement as well as some of the social concerns they had\nWait a minute this is a little little red schoolhouse his own room [laughter] it sounds like\nThen they evaluate it how it worked and what they found was that the children who were having that experience improved academically and also they became more engaged socially why what are the kids say happened\nI'm at the kids that they felt more supported\nThey had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them\nSo if you've been riding on a bus from Boston for an hour and maybe there's been conflict on the bus you could go to that meeting and talk about it get it off your mind and and be more focused in class or if something happened in class let's say here's an example that one of the kids provided in this study\nUm they were watching a film eyes on the prize which is about the civil rights era and some of the white kids were laughing at something that happened in the film\nSomething that the black kids found upsetting\nAnd so the fact that their white peers were laughing as though it were funny and the black kids were feeling like this is horrible\nI'm was upsetting to them rather than a walking around agitated they were able to talk about a debrief it's soda so to speak in that um [noise] time together in ways that they found helpful by the way the title of your book again why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria\nNobody ever asked why the white kids in the cafeteria their bonding in in many ways\nAbsolutely and it's also important to say as you just did\nWe don't ask why all the white kids sitting together and the cafeteria but in fact at the college level it is actually the white students who are more likely to be racially isolated it is possible for white kids still to not engage with the diversity to stick to people who look like themselves\nAn odd thing in any high school or just about every college the entire culture is black whether it's the music comedian they're following or the sports figures it must be very odd for young blacks to see that\nIt's true I mean certainly the cultural references that you talked about so you know those black artist to music become mainstream you know those athletes who are admired by white teens as well as kids of color um those are physical symbols\nFunding for here and now comes from ... simulates software accelerating the pace of engineering and learn more and now we're dot\nCom from NPR and W.

hundreds centennial until Robin birth certainly knew about his work says we all\nWould know about west side story and and the king and I\nHad that you're bowled over by something you didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about it the Germans Nineteen Seventy one ballet Goldberg Variations\nFor the New York city ballet set to close music from box let's just listen to him\n[noise]\n\nOkay so we will have all of the of videos that we talked about hearing here now dot org but what ... what are we seeing in this valley what did you see that\nThat really got to [noise] the thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story sweet which was on the same program and to my enormous surprise Goldberg variation turned out to be an incredible masterpiece eighty minutes long with a live in a stove or on the side [noise] every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks dial\nFriendly for them all it was just an amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers and all\nAnd it had the feeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of dance than to say that had the feeling of box cobra variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week [noise] and then I thought [noise]\nSomething's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as the west Side Story man that Peter Pan man's fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nAnd you even spoke to a friend who said oh you saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it\nExactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king and the saint of about ... and I knew that a lot of people thought because he was a Broadway guy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine ever thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and ... excellent biographies two of them and they both mentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that are encroaching had pant it and that she was the most powerful a dance critic\nAnd absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes\nUh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also culture and Robbins affects all angry man that was later but you became as you write like a court appointed lawyer you were going to Robin worth as a ballet choreographer\nAnd so let's take a listen to some of uh again the pieces and we will have as much visual as we can hearing out ordered afternoon of a fun Nineteen fifty three to the music of did you see\nA really key to the Nineteen fifty five Canadian TV taping of it with the original ballerina ... tiny Robin muse and dear friend [noise] and just as a year before she was paralyzed by\nPolio [noise]\nHow did a reimagining of the afternoon of a fun [noise] well I I just love the stand and it's only about ten minutes\nTwelve minutes long you can watch over and over and it just feels wonderful every time it's not just a reimagining of the music better reimagining ... version that he did in the very beginning of the twentieth century the fun is the main character and he has priest dancing around them and stuff but\nWhereas Robbins imagined this as a do at\nWonderful to where I think we're at simultaneously [noise] about the ballet world we're looking at two dancers in a studio partly and then it's also about a font and his dream girl who comes and visit him and\nWith those two dancers tend to kill the ... was it was a knockout\nWhat are they they're like they're watching themselves in a practice mirror that is what it feels\nDancers sometimes do in the studio [noise] said that there's this weird feeling of we're spying\nOn them in a way [noise] and bouncing himself never took the superior attitude towards things that had applied he would Balanchine loves dancers at a gathering which Robin made and [noise]\nDown she said it was so great you should make more make more it's like popcorn and he said [noise] like you could eat at the whole thing and literally popcorn\nThat followed drove others you know off the cliff but let's do a little\nDances at a gathering is this the dance Robin said Chopin music in Nineteen sixty nine [noise] he had been away from the New York city ballet can in Korea piece of Broadway but this stance of data gathering information head\n\n\n\n[noise]\nAnd what do we see in this day dance to the gathering start where the young man alone on stage and sort of ends up with him [noise]\nTouching that stage after\nMany many minutes I you know it's quite a long ballet [noise] all the answers coming in and joining him [noise] and they all get to strut their stuff and they combine in many different ways\nBut the idea is they are dancers hanging out together and so one of the things [noise] Jerome Robbins did it happen stand up beside watching each other as others are dancing it's again like afternoon of us on a combination of a work that's meant for us but it's meant to have\nA real worldly reality and worth the talks about self being on the stage\n[noise] uh you talked about his childhood which was difficult ... relationship with his mother\nUm and he became difficult there's a famous and encircle story about him backing up on stage during rehearsal he has his back to the audience that companies in front of him he's backing up backing up and no one tells him that he's coming at the edge and he falls in the orchestra pit and no one comes to helping\n'em he you know could be cool\nAnd ... and a lot of people talk about his cruelty and there are many many stories about how difficult he was and not just the dancers to Leonard Bernstein for instance when they were rehearsing west side story in Washington in a theater\nAnd Leonard Bernstein was sitting there near the front of the theater listening to play his music and Robbins comes tearing down the aisle and says to the orcas\n\nFunding for here and now comes from WVU are Boston and your NPR station from college vine where consultants work with high school students to identifying achieved their goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship awards more at college fine dot com\nAnd NPR and MORNING EDITION on this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nOf here and now every president since Jimmy Carter has voluntarily released his tax\nIn fact the appropriate time will oily so right now I Wonder can you know nobody cares you know like here's is you know you and a few people that are in question obviously in the public didn't care because I Won the election very easily\nSome Democrats have been pushing to get Trump's tax returns released Here's Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell speaking in Congress in April\nI fall on the German away from age just stopped delaying get Mr Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in the house in November you mean they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia school of law\nAnd former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now high Germany so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress to request the tax return information of any person or any business and directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested\nA upon receipt the committee must examine the information in a confidential manner\nUm but it can appoint agents such as a staffer outside experts\nUh the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee or it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request\nAnd to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of this is\n... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and the Senate\nThat's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees connect unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house it's not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol le defended could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing that investigation to submit any of the information that its obtain\nBut he would would resolve to do this now again the law doesn't specify but I think\nSound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of read them could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this this is a tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function or the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out beyond that obviously there have been stories or the New York times had a story about some of the tax filing\nPrior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a father\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest the New York times also raises the possibility of fraud and that story\nYes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee to in the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it searching it but I\nI think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action what is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is almost a hundred year old law\nAnd the circumstances when it came about we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances\nOr the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed [noise]\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress and the early Nineteen twenties\nUh there were a variety of reasons to principle one where they were carrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch including the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal involving some high level executive branch\nAnd because of the law they had to actually go to the president and request permission from the president to get a tax material even though they were investigating\nYou know I'm executives under the president and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nA there was a similar concern a about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who I'm with an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president or did not surrender or\nPlace in a blind trust his business interests but simply a retain them while he was in office and that obviously been raised all sorts of questions in Congress is mind\nAh the the the Coolidge in ... that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing administration push through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues of well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses you know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have\nThe authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already had\n[noise] do you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them that people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they see because what are we really going to learn from them well\nThat's a tough question because obviously it depends on what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be satisfied without knowing exactly what people want to see\nUm I Would think as a policy matter you'd want to see you know somebody who for example is very honest and their tax filing because that goes to the character of a person let's make sure that you first dude filed returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax\nBut if President Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good system but it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about him right so I agree with that I mean\nBut I think another area that would be\nFairly obvious to me would be the possibility of conflicts of interest we know that\nThe president has a lot of authority to undertake courteous uh relationships on behalf of the country and the question is\nWhat are the decisions and is there some personal or business\nInterest on the part of some of the decision making going on I Would think that would be a very legitimate inquiry on the part of a number of people in the public and if they wanted to know that all that would be something that might come out from an examination returns\nAnd I would add one more thing which is whether he actually made as much money as he said he did what we would find that out in terms of his yearly income\nYeah although I think that you know you need to be a little cautious about that because of tax return typically doesn't really show the amount of income the way you and I might or the ... member of the public might think of\nThat is you know how rich you are and and how much and so forth because a lot of that income of that sort doesn't actually translate into taxable income\nAnd so uh the return may not really show I mean it may show a relatively modest amount of taxable income in fact as you say it may show little or no taxes paid", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "17"}
