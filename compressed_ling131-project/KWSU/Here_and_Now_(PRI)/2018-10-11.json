I'm ... I'm Jeremy hops and it's here and now the devastation left by what was hurricane Michael he's becoming more clear today the storm has killed at least two people\nA man in Florida and an eleven year old girl in Georgia and for some the danger is not over here's FEMA administrator Brock Long\nRight now the focus is truly on life safety or making sure that uh we're helping people who may be trapped and are pushing through and doing damage assessments to make sure that we fully understand where we need to coordinate our response efforts\nJoining us now is Jeff Hoffman chief meteorologist with the Florida public radio emergency network Jeff whereas Michael today\nA Jeremy Michael's moving into the uh North Carolina region it has quickly moved to South Carolina this morning and over the next few hours from the heaviest rain from this will be near the Raleigh Durham area Fayetteville Greenville North Carolina the center of that storm passing near Charlotte still a tropical storm in likely will stay officially a tropical storm all the way to the coast there at the mid Atlantic states\nWith wins in the forty to fifty miles per hour range and some heavy rain\nWell and as Michael passes over the Carolinas this is the area that was already hit by Hurricane Florence what are the concerns there\nWell the heaviest rain from that thankfully is a a little more located further inland end to the mid state of upstate region still very heavy rain flash flooding concern big time in the hill country\nBut it is moving quickly uh so Jeremy that is going to mitigate the flood risk they're still going to be some runoff rivers that were of course are at their ... a week or so ago from Florence\nHave come back down they may come back up a bit but we're avoiding an extreme event in the Carolinas because it's moving quickly\nAnd what about further up in the northeast\nWell we have to watch out for tornadoes there's a tornado watch in effect for eastern portions of North Carolina southeastern portions of Virginia ... nine o'clock tonight I Believe and that risk will continue up into uh\nUh the Delmarva area doesn't become a nor'easter so there's going to be some coastal impact in New England or the center of this do should stay just offshore but I certainly this will be a far reaching storm all the way up into the coastal regions of New York in ... Massachusetts up in the main even\nA Michael at its strongest point was a category for hurricane with a hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds very close to a category five this is the same\nOur full storms ever to hit the U.S family and how did that happen\nVery warm water on the Gulf of Mexico very light winds aloft a this has been a season where conditions in the central Atlantic have not been particularly favorable for tropical development but it's just a goes to show it doesn't really matter where a storm forms as long as the conditions near an over it at the time\nOr can allow it to develop a it will develop very quickly um and yeah it is the lead intensity and the pressure was lower than Andrew when it came ashore um and it's one of these circumstances that Jeremy that it was still kind of been a strengthening phase ended approach land and we've had several hurricanes in the last decade that have weekend as they approached land\nA reminder that that can happen but the other the opposite can happen as well they can be strengthening as they approach and that's what that's what Michael did\nHow well they did hold up in terms of the forecast of of where it hit and the impact that it had\nWell just like Florence the track forecast when the hurricane center was really spot on here and that is that's also a reminder that the track forecasts have improved remarkably over the decades\nTo donate right now before you go out to lunch like there is but I end up U.

long time I decided it was time we don't want you to feel guilty we'd love to have your pledge justice sit near from Leavenworth go to the phone now eight hundred eight four to eight nine nine one\n\nThis is here and now I'm broadcasting from Southern California today as part of our election road trip it's a part of the country that is on the frontlines of the debate over immigration many California cities have taking matters into their own hands either by declaring themselves sanctuaries from immigration enforcement\nYou quote unquote broke the law by coming to this country to work with there was a work of plenty that's not something that I see that a city should be looking to arrest somebody four\nOr five voicing their support for immigration and Customs Enforcement or ice this is really about rule of law and about to local control this year a new state law took effect in California limiting how much local police can cooperate with federal immigration authorities\nThe law sb fifty four is called the California values act he's also known as the sanctuary law and has drawn lawsuits from the Trump Administration in several cities in California\nBut the legal battle kicked off in the small town of Los Alamos which voted to opt out of the law in March and it's now being sued by the American civil liberties union was telling me to city manager for Edgar says the sanctuary state law goes too far\nYou look at this it's really the difference between the boundaries of separation of powers between local jurisdictions state jurisdiction in federal\nFrom our perspective we wanted to go and take an option to say hey look we have the right to do this and that's when the ACLU came in and said we don't think you do have the right so now we have an outside group that's actually going and challenging asked on that issue [noise] how do you respond to some of the opponents of the who say that [noise]\nLikely to work with law enforcement on major crimes reporting things that are out because they're afraid of deportation\nI Would I I don't see it that way I think that um if you talk to people within a especially around and look down on me to stay in the north Orange County area\nYou'll see a lot of the immigration population that may not be legal thankful for what we're doing because we feel that uh or they feel that basically by us not abiding by the sanctuary laws what happens to these people that are bad\nActors that are illegal that get put in jail and then are not released back to the federal government come back into their communities and continue to terrorize their community and so from their perspective they are very thankful I think a lot of this says it's the politics and the soundbite source of the reality of what's going on on the ground\nEdgar met with President Trump earlier this year he's been in regular contact with the White House since the move by his city has been called racist and Xena phobic I asked him about that\nI don't think that has anything to do with racism um I I probably the best example and the real life example I gave us my wife is from Iran\nShe came when the shah was overthrown sheets of Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum in Paris for two years and wait in turn to get into the United states and so you know that is\nThe way immigration should work and you know I don't have anything ah about love for immigrants and I've actually you know with with my wife as an example I mean this has nothing to do with um it'd be an anti immigrant or racist\nMore than a dozen cities in California has sided with love telling me to find a state law mark ... is assistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland security investigations in the LA area or a chest high\nHeat the sanctuary state law is having the unintended consequences of complicating investigations into serious crimes like human trafficking\nFeel that this has become a political issue and it really should be that it should be a nonpartisan issue and it's a public safety issue features ... is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods\nThan if they took a minute to actually learn what we did I think they would be where we're very we help immigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of\nA lot of the immigrants that come across illegally or abused I'd met with a I've been on several interviews with women that were raped multiple times getting up here in our agents are the ones that help the immigrants that are coming up\nComing up here they take their life savings and they do very bad things to them or we're talking about criminal organizations that are doing the\nDetails his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle over the country is broken immigration system but others cities in orange county see it differently go a few miles down the road from us Alameda and you'll find Santa Ana which declared itself a sanctuary city long before the state passed its sanctuary law\nDivvied benefit ... is a city councilman there\nWe believe in the dignity of all people\nThan than er about eighty percent Latino about fifty percent of the residents of our city were born in another country so are the issues of immigration direct\nImpact us directly and being a sanctuary city insurers that we send a message to all of our residents that they're going to be treated respectfully a with dignity and I think that he's here to serve them well\nWe we spoke earlier with the city manager from Los Alamos who said I'm not anti immigrant in fact I'm married to an immigrant and that is not about racism why um why I'm doing this [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't hold back my uh laughter there if it hits a\nFrankly a pretty shallow a response\nThere with no need for them to do both on me to take the position that they did other than to send a political message\nThey're wanting them and other cities like them or wanting to send a message that California is not a welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that we've come far beyond that I Would hope and we believe in the dignity of every person who answers our city\nAnd that's what it means to be a century city [noise] and when President Trump says that you're giving states harbor the criminals you say what\nHe is a liar and has no idea uh about the laws and and the law of the land he often times talks about a violent criminals and\nI Do believe that any violent criminals should be held accountable the city's than than I Believe that any violent criminal should be ... held accountable they should be arrested they should serve their time however if\nYou're only crime quote unquote in leaving your country out of desperation looking to be able to uh survive being able to provide for your family that's not something that\nI see that uh that you should be looking to\nAbout took a ... a short drive around for this morally saw the debris field washed across the highway trees down I'm fortunate I've only got one dollar house as large debris everywhere I couldn't see to get out of jail the\nSurges and but it was just to your next we'll with with a troubled operation infrastructure the search for those more so I think the impacts of love of the leaders runoff from the store and water quality um in fact it's it's going to be filled here for probably some time\nTo worry about what what's your concern I'd have to say look\nThey fight for water allocation from from North Dakota reverted to reverse the Georgia where it's all them develop and most recently of large for ... for and it's just been one thing after another thought I Would have to say it's local community and the folks that make a living here\nUm because they can't they can't stay\nThat's pretty much it if they if there's nothing for me to ... if the seafood industry is impacted that bad I don't know what the courses for\nWell anytime right I just I I also know you you had a house filled with people seeking refuge people in creature seeking refuge um that's true yeah as you heard the tornadoes go by did you worry\nGiven the predicted storm surge in what was going on on St George Allen's I've never had qualms about taking people here were pretty hungry do it was a press event for us to the same time as\nWell as a little like Noah's Ark would you have their\nReal for people to dogs and these are four or five cats Noah's Ark would have been a that's a pretty good about what you\nWill Roy I stay safe we wish your uh area all the best\nThank you so much pleasure thinking about frankly get all the north of here are just not just right here on the coast further north up the river Tony liberty county in this hurricane was not a coastal event [noise] this is the worst I've seen\nWhere
