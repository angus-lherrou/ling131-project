years ago Trump denies that but did authorize a payment of a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to her to stay quiet about it just a month before the election in twenty sixteen\nTrump's former fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law by making that payment will Stormy Daniels has a book out this week called full disclosure she joined me from Beverly Hills to talk about it it is a memoir about\nThey don't want to do that because you know that doesn't define me of course everybody knows that you know about that ethic you know Ninety seconds and ah back in two thousand six with Trump and I was like I just don't want to write a tell all because it would be a very very short book\nBut then you know I really didn't have an outlet to tell my side of the story obviously I went on sixty minutes and hope to do that\nAnd the interview was over three hours but once it was edited down it was only fourteen minutes and some of the really key things that I Want it to express got cut out everybody knows what happened but nobody really knew how or why\nSo like you ... ... people haven't gotten the full picture of who you are\nCorrect and like I said how things transpired and why they happen the way they did and the way things unfold that so I just rushed the book and it was it was just my way of putting having complete control um although you know I'm Still show that people are just going to jump straight to chapter three and I've you\nKnow it might make a joke about that in the book but let's let's start with what you talk about at the beginning you grew up in Baton Rouge Louisiana you describe a rough childhood your mother would leave you alone for days without food\nOr you say you were repeatedly raped at the age of nine and you were called the liar when you tried to report that sexual abuse to a guidance counselor\nWhat are you were able to know about you and your life that you don't think that they do already know [noise]\nUm basically what I just said that I don't want to be defined by one single evening with someone that I met and just thought it was going to be a crazy night with a goofy TV star obviously I had\nNo inclination as anyone else that he was going to be a politician you know I just started the book with the background because I kind of wanted everyone to get a a feeling for where I came from but I think that like the most important thing that I wanted to get across is that\nI was established and my industry as a writer and director and a feature dancer [noise] um I had this completely different life although in its own right very extraordinary and so I just wanted people to know that there's a lot more to me than just that night\n[noise] what made you decide to finally come out and say this is what happened\nI was fine when saying nothing at all if I wasn't I Would have never signed a non disclosure I'm not stupid [noise] um and if I was going to do that I Would have asked for a lot more than a hundred and thirty thousand dollars once again I'm not too but I just wanted it to go away I didn't want it to affect my family or my young child\nDirected the mainstream things music videos legend small town in Texas was very happy with you know I'm doing air quote normal friends so this was the last thing that I Want it to come out but then somehow it got leagues and Michael Cohen started running its mouth and then they wanted me to sign additional statements that were completely false\nI was fine when thing nothing but I didn't want to lie in the meantime the story was exploding everywhere and people were attacking the left and right and call me names and I just wanted to set the record straight and I just wanted to be able to tell my side of the stories that people would understand where I was coming from\nAnd at the same time all these other women were coming forward\nAnd I just felt one day that it was the right thing to do so I did it\nWhat do you want to happen to Michael Cohen [noise]\nUm I think we're all about to find out on what it is a December twelve\nHe was the kind of orchestrate of this and the one who most importantly and if you read the book you'll understand what I'm saying he's the one that blew it you know I was totally fine with saying nothing at all I was actually thrilled\nAnd then he's the one that's already happened he broke the nondisclosure way before I did and then when he realized he'd messed up he just continue to do so\nI think he's going to get what he deserves but on the other side of that I also am starting to have a little bit of admiration respect that he did finally come clean and I'm at the moment that I got the call I was actually overseas in Europe when I got the call that he admitted that\nI was telling the truth was a huge moment for me because I'm used to being called all kinds of names I have a pretty thick skin being in the adult entertainment business you know but being called a liar was was really hard because I knew I was telling the truth\nWhen you make clear in this book are you worried for your safety all along still are\nRight that was my other reason for signing the nondisclosure which we all knew it was kind of a crappy deal um flip because there would be a record and so I figure it nothing really happened to me because there are people who knew about this non disclosure\nNow my fear lies mostly with just sort of crazy fans not directly related to the government or anything like that\n[noise] but you've got bodyguards though\nI Do I have to they're awesome [laughter]\nBut what is that what does that like I mean to to now be in a situation where you've got to have bodyguards all the time because of coming forward with your story\nWas very overwhelming at first you know I was used to being able to travel alone I used to be able to go to the bathroom alone [laughter] that\nIt's just the way that it is [noise]\nYou describe in this book when you first met President Trump in Lake Tahoe back in July of two thousand six and you\nSay your first impression of him was that he was run of the mill insecure which I find happens a lot with people with money that they didn't earn themselves they harbor this inner self esteem problem that they try to mask\nBy over compensating as you've been thinking back about that moment and as you've seen him as we all have over the last couple of years um as it shaped the way that you perceived him at the beginning at all [noise]\nUm no not not much I still stand by that feeling you know ask anyone I'm not personally nominate checks but I have a lot of friends in the business that that's what they do or that's part of their job and they will tell you that their\nBiggest paying and most unusual clients are CEOs and president this company is and people in a high power um and then the other thing about that is that people who grow up very privileged and spoiled for lack of a better word lack of social skills because no one's ever told them now\nAnd I think that was pretty obvious and still hold true today how would you describe it today [noise]\nI don't know I Would have to I mean I haven't talked to him and twelve years I think that he is a different person um at least the night I hang out with him he can make complete sentences\nOr there's a report in the wall Street Journal this week uh that alleges that Trump personally directed an effort earlier this year to stop you from publicly describing your alleged affair with him ... how do you respond to that\nI found out about that the same time you did I think it was yesterday I had just reading news on line it's the first time I've heard of that honestly and it doesn't it doesn't surprise me that it happened it just surprises me that I'm just not finding out about it\nThat actually brings me to another question which is how how much do you have to pay attention to the news now are you are you reading the news a lot more than you used to\nAh actually the exact opposite [laughter] I'm Rhonda ... he asked for like the first couple of months I was obsessed and was reading everything and I can't tell you the last time I actually had a TV on in my hotel room it just adds unnecessary stress and it's the same thing over and over and over\nSo you're not following politics closely\nUm things yes but I'm not reading the news and the news stories and specially staying away from anything about me\nWhere you're coming out with this book just a month before the midterm elections do you want\nLiterally how fast can get done how fast can get print that how fast can this happen it was not a strategy at least not on my part maybe the publishers smarter than I thought but I don't think so I don't think it was actually part of a master plan\nWhat do you what happened in the mid term elections or do you do have a view on that\nYou know I Do I think that it's going to be very interesting like I said I've watched everything turn I don't want to jinx anything so I'm just going to wait and say\nOkay I I Want to ask you about one more thing or that's in the news right now which is that President Trump has been talking at these rallies about Brett Kavanaugh on Christine Blasey Ford in her testimony and she just a at a campaign rally mocked Christian ... period\nI had one [noise] right [noise]\nWell do you think it was always wonder [noise] I'll do it\nHow did you get

that's when it sort of came on my radar\nUm it's got a very tropical kind of feel that route the album um and I know we're in the fall now but it's been a while since\nI spoke to you just want to catch everybody from class and the sound of the summer I\nIt'll you can still use the next time or two but\nWhen I'm screening albums to looking for stuff to play on my show as I can find three or

my show already [noise]\nSo basically like every every track on this album is great and that is like an unheard ratio for for my show to be into that\nMany of the songs but there's so many different looks I mean they have\nLike some songs inspired by Brazilian some butter some daytime disco this club ready house cut some ambient songs that kind of run the whole gamut and what would you say is the genre overall\nI Would say sort of like tropical electronic I mean I Would say you know they've definitely got an ear for a pop\n'em but it definitely is more electronic driven and or if I were to Johnny comparisons between other bands I Would say it's sort of like disclosure meet cool side\nOh I like that that's great we have poolside on the show actually they're great um yeah let's listen to the next when you brought up this is the Swedish group by agra boys are this is called for [noise]\n\n\n\nOkay so tell us what's going on here\nCompletely going on but I've seen a couple of different interpretations of this particular song and some people they're saying if the commentary on male hyper masculinity um when I first heard it I just thought it was really goofy on track 'em and it's one of those songs\nTo fire up before bed and this song so that has the same effect on me every time I hear it and\nObviously funny would you say it's like a good lesson to do you like to listen to\nThis song has been unbelievably find lists and yes I mean like ... after the after you get through the hook the first time you'll be guilty chanting the hook on your own the second time it comes around and

this song or the beat is really simple really funky but more than that it's just sort of the way he sounds on it as kind of\nOther worldly who is maverick saber\nHe's an Irish R. and B. singer I'm I guess he's been releasing records in two thousand eleven I Know a lot of people had been fans with him for a while I just sort of caught on to him with Tucson drifting\nA but he's also on the label of

album\nIncluding sorry daddy lessons and don't hurt yourself and she had a previous career as an ATM singer under the name winter Gordon but I feel like this is\nThis is Diana Gordon kind of doing her own thing sort of sort of a reinvention of Diana Gordon I guess and clearly multi talented person [noise] yeah I mean she she definitely knows how to write songs and and she can sing them too I mean sometimes when the singer things you can sort of feel their heart and soul and sweat if experience\nIn their voice and to me this is one of those instances [noise] um she just sort of recalling her

interested in\nPeriod psychiatric history in the Nineteen twenties and was writing about a psychiatrist at the time and I thought that this character of course needed a back story and that most doctors that time and have a back story that involves the first World War [noise]\nAnd so I began to read about the medical experience in the first World War and as I was reading that I began to encounter this anecdote of how the officer on ...\nSometimes ... to serve very important roles and field hospitals on the front tending to knock the numbers of men [noise]\nAnd this was at a time when I had recently finished medical school\nAnd all of a sudden to imagine this colleague across time hundred years ago leaving medical training and being asked to to foreign medical responsibilities that he was so impressed for something that resonated with me the place I was in at that time\nWell I mean he he's issued an army issued medical manual that off the advice on building latrines soothing blisters with whale oil and providing moral instructions a soldier who misses the comforts of his wife\nAnd what happens when he gets there is he hears about Louis that might be teeming with maggots just horrifying in churning clumps they teams they stirred like embers the life as well on every layer of clothing and every stitch and steam\nThey came out upon our comes grainy like wet meal just\nDisgusting because of the ... you know the moist dressings and amputations which he ... he had no idea how to do and enter this nun who teaches him all of this where did you find her\nSo originally I hadn't imagine her having the role that you eventually had in the story I had thought that was just for the arrive at a hospital and of course there'd be some medical staff and there'd be a nurse would\nProvide a background role for much like Lucia I found when I encounter she ended up taking over the story and she has very forceful force in the book and direct eventually the truth is going to be the central figure in the book\nSo something from your imagination not from history and here's a scene where she first dealing with Lucia who again has arrived at this place he doesn't know what he's doing and she says wash your hands come with me now we operate we'll start with headphones and amputate this what this leg this elbow\nThat forearm that I'm over there we can let the end just soldier loses ask smelling like that she says he'll be dead by morning\nDon't worry you didn't do it we keep them warm if he wakes up we tell him he's home because his father you call him son\nYou know right there just a snapshot of who she is and the Washington Post right she's your most irresistible creation actresses all over Hollywood should be jockeying to play her part in the inevitable movie adaptation\nWere you thinking cinematic Lee because it is I felt as if I was seeing a film as well as reading a story\nI don't think I was thinking explicitly cinematic way I think that I'm very drawn\nMikel settings because this takes place on the Eastern Front it's different than the world war one that I had all grown up imagining in the trenches and muddy field so of Belgium the different these are these large landscapes across which there's this encounter not only\nWith these modern military army but also very traditional ones soldiers on horseback ... glances and this is part of what drew me into the story these very rich visual images from the time\nLoses in fact at one point is lost in the woods and then she's in the middle of a battle on the front it kind of insane making did you see accounts like that\nA lot of the accounts that I read and I'd say many if not most of the kinds of the war accounts of battle\nAnd in that moment when Lucia stumbled into this classic Russian classic advance and a group of Hungarian has ours he realizes that despite the fact that at that point he's been on the front for almost two years he hasn't really seen war itself and\nThe rest of the book really looks at this other aspect of for what's happening on the home front what's happening in the hospitals\nWhat's happening to people after the fighting is over\nWhat's happening to their minds as we know it was the beginning of people starting to understand that there was this psychiatric torment they called it nervous shock\nSure so as a psychiatry ... I've been aware that one of the signal injuries of World War one is shell shock\nAnd yet at the time it was this great mystery to doctors men beginning to come down with wounds that couldn't be seen if there's some new kind of\nVirus is is a reaction to this new kind of artillery and particularly potent explosive it's being used in the war that was an initial thought that there was something about\nThe high explosives that was used during the war there was actually sending microscopic particles through the Gulf or the scan it into the brain and causing an injury to the brain but efforts were made to understand what was causing this [noise]\nThis new disease and then most acutely how to cure it\nAnd here where we see Lucia Dr mature because he is viewing this as a problem to be solved Margaret denying it during this as a human being\nThat transition you went through as a doctor\nIt is I imagine it's a transition that many doctors go through and then when medical training begins most of us have very little experience of illness in my own medical training I found that the transition over from the pre clinical years into the thirty year when you begin to go into words and meet people\nIs very disorienting one because for the first time you're encountering a disease that you've learned about in people who are suffering and they don't obey the same rules that you've learned about in the first two years it's much more complicated and beyond the impact of the disease on the Oregon\nThere's even more importantly the impact of the disease and the person and then beyond that and the impact of them around their family and those people who care for them and that increasing realization of the many ripples that result from illness is something that looks just go through\nA we just want to touch on the some of the absurdist notion there was\nThe daughter ring old professor Indiana who steals and alleged murder made from a medium because he wants to actually have to see what it is enter a young scientist female scientist by the name of Marie Curie [laughter] who else would that there was a staffer at the field hospital who was told he had manly hand\nAnd because he thinks they're special he doesn't want to watch them with just caustic soap so he gets dysentery and died is your place to buy another soldier with the same name it doesn't have serenity to war\nRight and probably to every conflict but particularly to this conflict ... bureaucracy was so expensive and so entrenched\nAnd so slow and reacting to realities of the battle the ground that\nThe soldiers were then it would often come up against\nThese absurd situations which were horrifying often but at the same time could with the kind of gallows humor that that one and counter them on the front be approached in some ways for some some kind of humor\nWell there's also a with a doctor Zhivago for us and we're not going to give away your incredible ending knocked me over when I got to it but there's a moment where lose just is chasing McGregor someone he thinks is Margot records were crowds he can't find her of course not just of August he chases\nOr a woman as well but again without\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W. B. U. R. Boston and your NPR station staples with printers printer ink on toner cartridges for home in business and in store print shops for customized presentation booklets and manuals more at staples stores or staples dot com staples\nAnd NPR and MORNING EDITION on this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had\nThis is here and now retailers prepping for the holidays got some good news this week the national Retail Federation expects holiday spending to increase by around four to five percent because of destroying the economy but there's a downside the low unemployment rate will make it very hard for stores to find seasonal workers\n... senior innovation reporter at W. B. or he joins us now I can tell them Hi Jerry and tell us more about how much people are supposed to spend this year how much they're expected to spend this year and how that lines up with pastures so the\nProjection is about seven hundred and twenty billion dollars in November and December and that excludes cars and gas and spending at restaurants are really just sort of those gifts around the holidays that would be about thirty billion dollars more than last year and just for perspective a\nSpending usually does grow year over year but the average growth rate in recent years has been about three point nine percent so somewhere between four and five would be above average\nAnd how does that line up with the fact that we've talked about mall vacancies being at high levels about big department stores having problems like\nMacy's right so the trend is undeniable I'm In Cyber Monday last year was the biggest online shopping day in history\nAnd meanwhile the foot traffic in brick and mortar stores on Black Friday was down by two percent so I think the overall spending increased can help the retailers to do both and I think one really interesting experiment this year is way fair the online furniture retail it they are experimenting with temporary\nBrick and mortar locations in those shopping malls but interestingly they will just be showrooms you can actually buy them there you see them in the physical space in that order on line is it\nThe ... model of where you can go and try things on but you have to actually go on line to buy it um what about this idea that it's hard for these places to attract seasonal workers\nQuite so we just saw a Amazon a couple of days they can increase minimum pay to Fifteen dollars an hour and that increasing it looks like it will be the norm this holiday season\nThe market research firm Wakefield research published a survey last week of a thousand retailers and reported that the average hourly wage this holiday season is going to be Fifteen dollars and forty cents and that's a big jump from an average of eleven in Seventy cents last year\nAnd the minimum wage just above seven dollars an hour a nationally what about the trade war and terrorists is that going to have an impact on how much we're spending on gifts\nYou could add the Retail Federation says it's concerned about those terrorists has an estimated what the overall impact will be but of course we've been hearing for months from businesses saying that the ... of the tariffs especially on Chinese imports could make their costs go up and therefore they would have to pass those along to consumers\nMore thing account big economic news today and probably driving the market slower today is that\nRight so it was up to about three point two percent that's the highest since uh two thousand eleven as you said this is another sign of confidence in the U.S economy hard to know exactly what goes on in investors' minds but of course they're weighing the risks versus reward in a treasury notes considered very\nSafe investment that's why the interest rate is typically lower than what you might be able to get into riskier stock market but if that interest rate takes up a little bit maybe people don't want to take so much risk in the stock market\nAnd maybe mortgage rates and other things also start to pick up even more ... of WB or thank you so much to be with you\nOr as we heard earlier a vice president Mike Pence took a hard line on China today including it stand on Taiwan saying well administration will continue to respect or one China policy Taiwan's embrace of democracy shows a better path for all of the Chinese people\nKind of course insists Taiwan is part of its territory and actively works too isolated diplomatically and that power struggle is playing out in an unlikely region only Seventeen countries in the world still recognized Taiwan including several in Latin America\nAs part of our continuing series on China's expanding role in the world\nNPR's Carrie Kahn reports on a small and poor region of Latin America increasingly embroiled in Asia diplomatic tool\nThis summer El Salvador's president Salvador scientists and then went on national television and said the word Beijing wants to hear\nYour only ... percent ... the only legitimate representation of China is the People's Republic of China said send just sat in Taiwan he added is in in ... part of China\nWithout Salvador moved over to the Chinese side of the diplomatic scorecard further isolating Taiwan internationally and opening itself up to trade and much side after foreign investment with the world's second biggest economy\nChinese foreign minister Juan he praised El Salvador for what he described as it's unconditional Ed Sheeran to the one China principle that Taiwan is part of the mainland and not a separate democratic country China will not recognize or do business with countries that have relations with Taiwan shuffle ...\nThis is the right choice and conforms to international norms and trends of the time said wine\nTaiwan's international support began waning after it lost its seat to mainland China and the United nations and Nineteen Seventy one by the Nineteen nineties about thirty country still chose Taiwan over Beijing but China has been whittling away at those allies to date only\nAmerica and the Caribbean in the last two years since ... women are pro Independence Party took power in Taiwan three countries have severed ties El Salvador and the Dominican Republic this year Panama with it's vital inter oceanic shipping canal switched allegiance says last year China's the canal second largest user after the U.S [noise]\n\nWith fireworks in Chinese dancing dragon Panama's President Juan Carlos ... gosh do various countries new diplomatic ally at the opening ceremony of a huge container port\nAt the Caribbean entrance of the canal the one point one billion dollar investment wasn't ... the same day Panama severed ties with Taiwan over\nWe are so happy with this group of Chinese investors said but I left and thanked them for bringing jobs and opportunities to the Central American nation China has invested billions and Panama's infrastructure telecommunications and energy generation in recent years\nAnd has a goal to spend more than two hundred and fifty billion dollars by two thousand nineteenth throughout Latin America\nThe decision to switch allegiance says is more monetary than ideological especially now that China's Central America second largest trading partner says Enrique do civil Peters a China expert at Mexico's national autonomy university\nWhere he's from more all for British or for the Central American countries to promote the first term because the president's will turn ... years in\nAnd says colon Alexander of Nottingham trench university Taiwan doesn't have the same resources anyway\nThere's no point in Taiwan saying well we'll get we'll much done if you something else because I wanted to go after ISIL she's got\nAlexander who wrote a book about the relationship between Taiwan and Central America says the independent island nation would be better off emphasizing shared commitment to democracy and transparency unlike China's opaque authoritarian ways\nAnd that's exactly what Taiwan's president citing wean has done in recent swing through the region aimed at preempting more diplomatic defections like in this address to the Guatemalan Congress last year\n[noise]\nStressing the two countries similar struggles from war to democracy side declared the friendship between Taiwan and Guatemala sperm and stable the White House has worn China about interfering in domestic politics of nations in the western hemisphere even though the U.S doesn't\nProtests last month over the diplomatic defections the U.S State Department temporarily recalled three chief submissions from Panama the Dominican Republic and now Salvador this isn't a permanent recall it's certainly not a break and relations but it's a shot across the bow Eric Farnsworth vice president of the council of the Americas of Washington DC based think tank\nSays China has an infamous record burdening poor countries with huge debt and the taking of a strategic infrastructure as collateral for the unpaid loans he says it's one thing when China does this in Asia Africa\nBut in other places like Central America\nCountries where that that have had a very close relationship one or the other with the United states that's different to particularly from the view of Washington but now it's getting pretty close to home literally and figuratively and that's why I think the alarm bells are starting to go off\nFormer U.S ambassador to Panama John feely says U.S officials should worry about China's growing access to key allies in sensitive information not that China will staged military bases in the hemisphere\nWe are talking about is a ... increase in diplomatic ... throughout the region that will compete in spaces where previously the United states was very clearly the partner choice\nBefore the U.S handed over the canal in Nineteen Ninety nine a huge American flags on a bit of land to set the entrance to the Panama Canal China's helping their flag will soon take up that symbolic spot they let the panamanians now that's where they want to Iraq
