Jeremy and what more do we know about this news Saturday explanation for what happened well\nWe we know it has a fully hasn't come out yet are there are a lot of reports that it's being crafted what's interesting about this is that it echoes something that a President Trump said yesterday morning after he'd spoken with king sol bond the father uh Mohammed bin Salman his son effectively runs Saudi Arabia\nAnd the you know yesterday the president talked about a a rogue group of people maybe having a kill Jamal ... ah and then that's what the Saudis are floating\nAt the issue here is that the Saudis are looking to accept responsibility in some fashion for this so that the story can move on at the moment they're they're facing the threat of sanction and a lot of businesses that are very upset about this whole thing so they're trying to\nUh work their way out of it but no explanation officially and\nWhen you see the explanation was being crafted ... does that imply that my ... the secretary of state is helping to Saturday's craft the explanation for what happened\nWell it's unusual that before an explanation comes out my Mike Pompeo is there a if one could be a fly on the wall one might assume that uh my palm pay was explained to the Saudis that this was a difficult position for the United states to be in because it is such a\nA supporter of Saudi Arabia and because of the global Magnitsky Act which a number of senators have triggered a that say that when the United states has dealings with a country that engages in human rights abuses\nThe president has to take action within a hundred and twenty days so Mike Pompeo maybe spelling out the fact that the president may not be able to skirt the so the Saudis need to do something so that the next step can take place what\nHas all of this done to the U.S relationship with both Saudi Arabia and with turkey where are they the alleged murder happened\nSo this is interesting because turkey and Saudi Arabia or not allies they are they they sort of compete for being the economic and power center of the Muslim world arguably Saudi Arabia has succeeded\nA because Saudi Arabia has such largest but Turkey's more industrialized country it's more western facing it's a NATO member turkey as you know handed over pastor Andrew Brunson who had been jailed for some time so it does seem that turkey in sort of throwing Saudi Arabia under the bus for this\nAlleged murder and then releasing this past year\nMaybe it has a very very strong very long a business financial diplomatic arms and energy relationship with the United states and I this is the first time in the history of those two countries are at least since Nineteen Seventy three since the ... oil embargo that it's been this fraught what\nAbout all the companies that have gotten upset and decided that they're not going to go to this big Saturday investment conference J.

on Instagram throwing shade at President Trump in fact that's the title of his book shade\nA tale of two presidents Pete Souza joins us now to talk about a welcome back to hear now thanks for having me on Germany and when you left the White House or did you have any idea that you would become more part of the public conversation\nNot at all it's [laughter] it's just something that as the days and weeks and months went by and twenty Seventeen\nIt became apparent that I had a voice where uh I and I needed to use it in a way just to demonstrate what is happening is not normal\nAnd I thought I was able to do that on Instagram using my photographs and commentary and how did it start\nIt started somewhat accidental I had seen a picture of the new Oval Office like on January twenty first are twenty second and it was ... you know gold and ornate and I thought it looked like a Saudi palace more than\nThe oval office so I posted a picture of a President Obama but the the red curtains behind him and I wrote a caption that just said something like kind of like the old curtains better [laughter]\nAnd I guess it was a double meaning in my mind but I didn't know how people would react whether they would get it and in that very first post someone a said that I was throwing shade on the new\nA new president you didn't even know what that term it I didn't even know what that term men after you know I started oppose the war and then I heard that the term shade again and I and I figured I better look it up\nYou also posted when when President Trump made a lot of news talking about how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history and a lot of people showed photographs to prove that that was not the case you posted on January twenty first twenty Seventeen\nThe biggest credit history was really on January twenty two thousand nine huge in all caps with the picture of the national mall\nThat the picture was what prove what was true yes I Do you get any negative feedback on your Instagram feed\nA a little bit very very few though I mean if you go through the commentaries there's very rarely is there a negative feedback in and what's interesting to me is\nIf I'm if there is uh my uh it's kind of followers are have my back and they they ended up coming back to these people and they often point out to me\nUh people that that they feel or just bought [noise] maybe I don't know if they're rushing bots but people trying to stir up trouble not really interested in my Instagram feed just and saying what they want to say\nIn this book I you've got a often either Trump tweets alongside your Instagram post or a news story alongside your instrument postings one I'm looking at right here\nFive President Trump said on may six twenty Seventeen the reason I'm staying in Bedminster New Jersey a beautiful community it's staying in New York City is much more expensive and disruptive meetings exclamation point you wrote stuck in meetings at sunny lands in rancho mirage California twenty sixteen and it's a picture of President Obama golfing\nRight I mean let's just let's I well I don't understand why the the price of the United states can't be honest I mean just say you're staying in bed Bedminster because you want to play golf\nAnd but to to just lie about golf I mean it makes no sense to me so that was sort of just a you know tongue in cheek right folk poke I guess\nWhat's the one that you're most proud of the like I Can't believe I thought of that [noise]\nAh the the I have to correct myself up sometimes when I when I come up with just the right picture in the right comment I guess\nYou know a Trump is always saying you know it's a witch hunt and it's a witch hunt I don't know how many times he's he's written that an exclamation points and all caps a ... in regards to the FBI and investigation um [laughter]\nAnd I and I found a a picture of a a a young girl dressed as a which had a at a Halloween party and I just I think I wrote um you know another kind of which I I have to admit that I correct myself up\nThere's another one uh where you've got\nThat's at forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history Fox News ... every other network and you Instagram forty eight million people watched the twenty times in the union address on television just saying\nYeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had to kind of look it up a and and and and verified it with two or three sources that in fact President Obama as it was a two thousand Penn State union was the largest and in history [noise]\nSeems like there's another theme in here which is that President Trump has gotten into a lot of high profile fights with world leaders and when that happened you show a photo of President Obama very happy with these other world leaders having a nice conversation with them\n[noise] uh yeah I mean that's been pretty easy to [laughter]\n... you know you mentioned uh another one that I really liked it I cried myself up over was\nWhen he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong ... and ... and calling him little rocket man and rocket man and you know my button is bigger than your button all this kind of stuff [laughter] and I posted a picture of President Obama with a gun right and I said there's only one\nRocket man [laughter] what is President Obama think of what you're doing\nUm you know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing this in a coup boots with him or that he was going to have any input I just saw him a week or so ago and now that the book is actually printed\nUm I told them that I was doing this book and he just you know he he didn't say that much about it [laughter]\nOr at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nOr no he he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows when I'm up to\nThe U.S ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by somebody else before you post among us around\nNo these are all a pictures that were previously made public honoring the administration so they are considered public domain so anybody can use them there was another guy that has a has a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine [noise] and but he's allowed to do that so\n[noise] so what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of President Obama already or do you want to do something else\nThat out a search for what kind of photography do I want to do but I definitely want to do new photography and I want to move away from 'em at least us politics for sure how come [noise]\nUm because I don't think that I'll ever have the kind of situation that I had with President Obama where I had a dynamic a a person to a photograph every day um someone that I had you know admired\nSomeone who gave me incredible access and I think I Would just be frustrated I'm trying to photograph politics\nWhen I Know that I couldn't get that kind of access to someone else at least I don't think I could and and and I've never you know I sort of ended up as a political photographer it was never\nSomething that I had aspired to do it just things just sort of happened uh because I took a right turn and instead of a left turn 'em and so I Want to sort of explore some other aspects of photography that I that I just don't get to do that much now\nPizza that one more question for you um you know everybody now takes pictures with their phone you can tell when you look at a Pete Souza photograph that it's a really great photographs compared to what most of us were able to do although some people are great amateur photographers\nWhat is your one piece of advice that you give to people about how to take a better picture [noise]\nOh boy I'm\nOne piece of advice I can I give to yeah sure [laughter]\nUm you know for a ... the lighting lighting is so important to people forget about that so if you're going to do pictures when you're traveling around the country or the world [noise] usually the early early morning or late in the day the last two hours of flight is the best time [noise]\nA part of this week based on a you know research is working at a temp to isolate the minority students it was an attempt to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special interests but um our white students are comfortable in their\nClassrooms looking around and seeing themselves in a school teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and if for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in our predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWell you refer to this school handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and or cultural identity oh what's that research\nThere there's research and this was a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that um those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions\nBeing made about them based on their identity and that as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing that being part of a larger group having colleagues um is supportive of their development of their academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the way many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like\nThat that they could go to so we have affinity groups for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students who have to choose between going to benefit of the group that matches their identity or\nSome other activity with a broader group of friends at a puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes for a let's say an African American students is one of a few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that group and and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experience there having\nNo research also suggest that when teachers and students have different cultural exchange and let's say the teachers away and the students are black then they have different\nIt's much uh you know there's much lighter exchange between the teacher and a student in and out of place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both those ... even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nAnd this is an unheard of in twenty eleven a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school had a junior classified itself for several minutes everyday along racial gender or language lines probably the same reasoning that you were getting for people to feel a sense of not being other you know being with\nBut you know any time there's a grouping of minorities in particular it just feels like segregation literally a segregated home that you had you know what do you worry about the wisdom that\nWe do and I I'd say two things about that one if you you know as people learn about our school or know about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group of people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice and that's what we've done for nearly a hundred years [noise]\nI also think it's important to know that um you know these were students of color and\nSome of their white classmate in a classroom with ... both white teachers and teachers of color having a parallel experience to the other home room and the the suggestion that this was like a segregated school from\nYou know way back when is is ludicrous\nYou know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen Twenty one always seen as a progressive school\n[noise] so what happens now a huge drop the homeroom experiment how do you move away\nAnd we will be doing what we have done and quite frankly what a what a lot of independence schools do which is to have race be one of the components of his students identity that we think about when we're putting class placement together and we've entered into a community conversation with faculty and parents and students alumni\nTo continue to look for the best way to meet the needs of all of our students students of color included so that we can have all of our students have the full story I experience I'm going forward [noise]\nBy the way el R. E. I. that stand for the little red schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school there in Manhattan\nOne of the kids say [noise]\nUm some kids who remain somewhat confused by the need um other kids feel super supported so a lots of conversations with students coming forward\nThat's Philip cats and director of the little red schoolhouse in Manhattan so thanks so much it's been a pleasure\nTomorrow we'll speak with an African American educated who says there are times to recruit kids of color together you just have to get it right [noise]\nOkay wanna smile go now to hear now dot org and see the finalists in the annual comedy wildlife photography a war photographer Tom sell them as a judge he joined us by Skype from the Netherlands Tom these are just the final is how will you choose\nWhat is a very good question I she ... the picture that makes me laugh out loud and I don't have to think about why I just about how I Do like every ... as I said\nWell let's take a look at them and by the way we're radio so you can go to hear now dot org and follow along we'll try to describe it as best we can also have last year's winters up because those were hilarious\nBut this year it with a picture on his hands are held out his mouth wide open as if he sang job [laughter] it's called caught in the act or from photographer marry him a gallon I mean that's laugh out loud\nIt allowed and definitely one of my favorite I think it's impossible just to see the animal and then ... ... ... and I'm thinking something goes through your mind very quickly I had the vision of showing up in United her showing an unite was up to a friend [laughter]\nIt's just a few different while other people use at UC schools things do you know people's different things which is why I Love that poem petition because that street humid is on different levels where everyone\nYou see well yeah I got gel nails this time we [laughter] we have that to a komodo dragons this is a photo by Saturday savvy each call marsh and [laughter] and their tails or with the behind them and they're in an embrace and they do a little like a little Martian like\nThey do to motion like and I'm actually they shouldn't be cold komodo dragging their their relatives of the komodo so that they ah I I think the main goal monitors but when you see them in a sort of embrace dumb things they do because you know dumping on bracing that quality fighting but\nIt kind of fish that temperament they all be friendly and sleep\nWell and they're probably you know they just got stuck together or something and they were signing tons\nUm there's the exasperated grizzly Danielle ...\nHe just looks like a guy behind you know ... what next no it\nIt's an amazing thing the animals because the basis of the competition is to raise awareness animals in the back but\nYou know they just wouldn't be around and trying to get that he is and I think people are getting a bit tired of seeing sort of gruesome imagery that says it with animal consideration so we just feel that if we can build a positive emotion than we may take the discussion slightly different direction\n[noise] well I tell you uh you'll have the winner of the competition in November to me this is more important than the world series um we have all the pictures and here in our diet or\nFunding for here and now comes from that weren't greeters of Matt ... somewhere accelerating the pace of engineering and science you learn more and now we're not\nCome from NPR and W.
