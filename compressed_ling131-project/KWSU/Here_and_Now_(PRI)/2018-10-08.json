in China billionaires Muslims a movie star and increasingly feminine according to lead to Hong Fincher feminism is having a moment to China and that is deeply frightening to the Chinese government\nVenture is author of the book betraying big brother the feminist awakening in China she says she hasn't seen as social movement this powerful since the gentleman square protests of Nineteen eighty nine ... ...\n... thanks so much for having me here nice\nTo talk to you tell me first the focus of the book is the feminist five these are five young women in China who are at the core of your story um the theme that you present is the political is the personal give us\nExamples of how among these five women are the personal became the foundation of their activism and also who they are what they did\nRight so I'm In these five women became known as the feminist five after they were jailed and twenty Fifteen\nFor planning to celebrate International Women's day um and it wasn't just those five women there were a lot of women in different cities across China who were planning to handout stickers about sexual harassment on subways and buses\nBut before they even carried out their plan the police and and all of these Chinese cities just carried out a sweeping round ever rats\nAnd focused on the five women the feminist five brought them to Beijing and detained them for thirty seven days before there was a huge global outcry that resulted in their beliefs are being detained for what has he done well well um well this is this is what was so outrageous about it because\nI'm the authorities were kind of feeling around for something to charging them with and and and the and it was something I can too disturbing that social order\nUm that the the reason why the arrest and jailing of these women just galvanized so many so many people in the feminist community inside China and globally is that it was just so outrageous because all they wanted to do was to handout stickers raising awareness about sexual harassment\nOkay so I Want to find out why that was such a threat to the government to uh just doing something like you know handing out stickers or making T shirts and handing them out against sexual harassment but first what gave what was the impetus for these particular women do have some fun um well\nPersonal lives while growing up um\nFor example the nights herself spoke about quite severe um physical violence or at the hands of her father\nI'm from a very early age and her uncle um some of the other activists had also encountered sexual abuse and and it wasn't just these five women are a lot of the women who um who have been involved in the women's rights movement\nHas personally being um victims of sexual assault or a very severe domestic violence\nAnd that has given these women and ten cents a personal commitment to fight back one of the\nSome of his five oh one month prisons had to have a master's degree to teach high school where his men and joined only need a bachelor's degree you know there'll be some people who remember mostly don't use a famous adage women hold up half the sky or in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China\nOr equal without ever the case and if so what happened to that [noise]\nYes well I mean in the early communist era and there were a lot of changes brought about for women because I mean even even though women still had to have seen the double burden of working in the workforce and and and then taking care of children and cooking and the and\nThe fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs either in the cities or said that they had to go work in the fields and so that brought women out of the confinement says of the household\nUm instead of female labor force participation was really on the highest in the world and in the early communist era and and and the propaganda rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do\n'em and say even today you seeds and legacy of that early communist era because\nChina's seemed female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries although it's it's really falling a dramatically with the onset of a market reforms\nUm but but now in the last couple of decades you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality as I'm with the dismantling of the planned economy so many women who've been laid off relative to men and the gender gap is is rising exponentially in so many ways\nAnd that's a big part of why the feminist movement has grown is because of that just\nBehind men and so many young women today feel that that's really profoundly unfair what what is the threat that the Chinese government feels yeah well I mean this is what is so fascinating because on the face of it I mean what these women are doing is actually in line with\nThe Chinese government's expressed belief and gender equality um that if you look at the bigger situation of China and now the economic growth the economic miracle of the past few decades is basically over so they are slowing economic growth\nThe workforce is shrinking and birth rates are falling and the population is aging drastically so the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing\nA particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government\nIs trying to do because these young feminists are telling other women no you don't have to get married you don't have to have babies if you don't want to but I'm In many ways I Believe that that that sexism and massage any and subjugation of women pushing\nWomen to return to these traditional roles of beautiful wife and mother\nUm all of that is at the core of what I called China's patriarchal authoritarianism how is the Chinese government pushing that\nWell I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is a very aggressive propaganda\nUm that that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn thirty otherwise if they wait too long then their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a\nAn official Chinese state media that women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant\nUm they should seize on their so called best childbearing years and they can have a baby or even to while they're still in college so propaganda is a big part of it but then there's also policies um said that the um [noise] much publicized so called one child policy recently ended\nSo China officially now has a to child policy it's being encouraging are trying to push 'em particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children but in spite of this really dramatic posts\n... poses a huge crisis for the Chinese government as it looks to the future um and so there's this huge confrontation now between\nThe agenda of the government which is pushing the very traditional gender norm I'm pushing women into into the home to become baby breeders on the one hand but then you have this enormous I'll swelling of I'm particularly educated young women who are pushing back\nIn every way um and so what is unfolding right now isn't just an extraordinary moment in China's history\nAnd the Internet played a big role as well more and more women went on line and we're sharing their stories and other areas I work with all of a censorship going on in China will well this is what is so fascinating\nBecause in spite of the intense Internet censorship would just become incredibly sophisticated that these women are ... there are so imaginative that they find ways\nOf circulating their message and getting around the censorship censorship\nI mean just to give one example there was one activist who I'm Wendy hash tag made to with being very heavily censored this one young woman came up with the idea of using him oh jeez for rice\nAnd Bonnie which which is me tool in Chinese which sounds like me too\nAnd so that was one way or that they were able to gain a get around the censorship\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

them in danger and conservative Tehran, Iran\nHer latest book is called here to stay it takes on the issues of Islamophobia and cyber bullying at a private school near Boston the hero is a high school junior name be Shaun he's of Middle Eastern descent and his sudden stardom on the basketball court\nHas some ugly consequences sheriff Arizona's a child of parents who came to us from Iran I asked her what she and that shouldn't be John have in common\nWe went to a similar high schools um he doesn't go to my high school it's fiction but we do go to a predominantly\nWhite an affluent um private school as you did I I did which was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I played basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller [laughter] so [laughter] you should um\nGive it up we both love comic books and we both like women but have difficulty talk\nThat is Jordanian um his mother is a Persian but grew up here\nSo you place to be John directly on the basketball court I'm beyond is a star player he's realized to be a star player really quickly and kind of rises in in social status very quickly but then things change what happens in the school\nSomeone doesn't like all the newfound attention he's getting and I'm One of his colleagues and right right and heat you don't know who sent the email 'em but has created a photo shop the image of him to look like a terrorist holding an AK forty seven was in the ... face right All right yes her shop on yeah\nAnd uh had sent it anonymously to the student body so the school is trying to figure out who was sent to his mother and other parents are are very upset and I'm wanting to figure out how to fix the culture of the school and make sure he's OK\nOther students are that are behind him an ally sort of inadvertently want to make him a poster child for something and he just wants to\nBe a kid and so he's basically saying you know look I don't really want to be um the poster boy for international politics right [laughter] and people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is\nHe really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kinds of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to I Know kids should really have to did you have to deal with it I sort of did the saying where when nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared\nI didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all the rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSo I sort of made it a point to say please don't get caught up in racial profiling and that sort of thing\nAnd then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school paper they called me Arab American which I'm not not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim I grew up pretty secular but yeah technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating a Japanese person to a Korean person where it so it was just kind of I think people just didn't know what to do and then started asking not invasive questions but sort of like they never really thought of\nIt before you called us polite racism and this was something to be John faces as well yeah what's the difference between polite and impolite where he says I think most people get the impression that\nBetween painting something on your house or throwing a rock and a window versus a micro aggression or saying something that sort of a little barbed or and made to some sort of other someone\nSo how does ... in the book real life to understand\nI think he's he's had to deal with sort of its infer that have sort of had to deal with stuff before it just never been as viral as he does in the book\nAnd he for the most part is pretty cool and calm and collect\n'em and stands up for other people and his fear and himself but there are other times when his internal monologue you can tell that he is really hurting\nAnd I think that's important too especially for boys where they might say like you know set bird yeah how's school fine you know but inside there's a lot of other stuff going on so I tried to to have him have a pretty rich in her life\nSo he puts up with a polite racism and then you know you get into the idea of cyber bullying and then things become exacerbated and get even more painful\nWhen you were writing this how did you decide whether to make some of the characters that Caucasian character specifically in the book deplorable or not deplorable I mean what what in your own experience made you decide well maybe this person is uninformed and this person is racist\nFor me personally it was really difficult to write this book because they do want to get away from books that are sort of like where the character has to deal with the former Soviet like the character digits cabinet adventure or\nYou know be the hero and you know get to do stuff that other main characters get to do twenty of just like you don't want it just like the character doesn't white person you don't want to be the ... well no but for all kids like I just want them to be able to be like I Am the basketball hero and this is you know what I've achieved\nBut I did want to sort of address this thing that really\nHas bothered me for quite some time and it's not that I think that there are certain people who can't combat racism or or get over it maybe after the book finishes\nBut for that time and space I Want to talk about things that I think young people are dealing with and maybe don't get a lot of media time\nWhat do you what does the pay for you if it's just getting the book out there do you want to hear from people who recognize themselves on one side or the other in the book\nJust one story and one perspective I Do hope that he is a main character that maybe people were not expecting and really loves\nI just want this kid to really even though he's fictional I'm very fond of him I didn't like making hurt a lot of times but I Know that if maybe people read about him hurting bell hurt real people last\nIf you were you know I mean there's the young adult book if you were kind of work up a lesson plan for this and you wanted to conversation to be started among students what would be the theme of that conversation\nHuh I Would say what does it take to find one voice and prejudice times and how can you stand up for yourself and others when that's really difficult [noise] which is a great hope but we'll see how that pans out\nSarah ...

toll on civilians who are caught in the crossfire\nA civil war started there in twenty fourteenth today in Yemen much like in Syria the fighting has turned into a proxy war involving other countries on opposite sides of the U.S back to the coalition led by Saudi Arabia is trying to oust rebels known as who these who these are backed by Iran\nDavid Miliband has seen all of this up close he's president and CEO of the international Rescue Committee David Miliband you were just in Yemen two weeks ago what did you see there\nI mean Yemen is the world's largest humanitarian crisis this is a country of twenty eight million people\nEight million people are being fed by the un world food program every day it's a country with three and a half million people are on the brink of famine and what eighty three percent of the population are in extreme public ... on the temptation is to describe this was a tragedy\nIn fact it's an indictment because this is not saying natural\nOver the last three and a half years I neither side winning and they want to ask you about that war because there are lots of people who want to pay attention to what's happening in Yemen it feels very remote it feels is very complicated as well um could you describe in your own words what this is all about\nYeah I mean Yemen is a conflict goes to the heart of the trauma that he's going across the middle east at the moment the government of Yemen was toppled in two thousand and fourteen by who the to the who sees are a group from the north of the country socio economically deprived\nOr they rolled over the then government and capture Seventy percent of the country I'm what's happened since then is that of Saudi led coalition with us support and so you kind of the European support so it's not that far from home because the U.S is very strongly implicated in as\nA Saudi led coalition has been trying to pull the Yemen the control of the capital Sana'a enough Seventy percent of the country the truth is the Eighteen thousand bombing raids that have been led by the Saudi led coalition of not shifted the front lines\nUh Seventy to eighty percent of the humanitarian and commercial traffic goes through the port of data which is currently choked really uh by the fighting only a trickle of aid and commercial traffic is getting through\nI'm what's happening in Yemen is that that conflict between the who sees and the Saudi led coalition has both in the Iranians are supporting the who sees\nBut either right then the other side from the Saudis the U. S.
