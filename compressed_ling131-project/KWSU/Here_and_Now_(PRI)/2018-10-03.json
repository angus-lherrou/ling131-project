Boston and exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening tests that can be used at home by prescription only information that color guard test dot com\nBusiness here and now the Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded today to three researchers whose work has harness the power of evolution to American Scientist Francis Arnold and George Smith and one British scientist Gregory Winter are sharing the prize\nLet's bring in Peter door how he's president of the American Chemical Society and he's in Manhattan, Kansas at Kansas State university\nUh Peter welcome at first the royals Swedish Academy said the winning research applied the principles of Darwin in a test to explain that\n[noise] so first of all let me start out with my congratulations on behalf of the American Chemical Society to our our three Nobel new Nobel laureates there they're tremendous breakthrough work in using chemistry to speed nature's own processes and that's that's the reference to Darwin in a test tube\nOf the laureates have used chemistry to accelerate the evolution of natural biological molecules that act as the critical machinery to the cells of living organisms and when we talk about\n[noise] well uh being able to identify a process within a cell\nAnd to have that sell live through the next generation and continuing with that particular new process inside is and in a sense of a natural selection that will survive if that new process improves the environment for that so\nWhy is this works significant\nWell the the ability to actually go into a simple cell as we might think of that and to do some fundamental chemistry is actually a lot more complicated than it sounds like we do chemistry in a beaker flask\nWe control of fewer of uh the the variables and and we're able to really understand some of the outcomes that we're all Timothy observe\nBut in all you know living cells like a a whether it's a bacterium or or or other living so\nIt's a lot more complicated than just a simple Baker had some real breakthroughs here to be able to fine tune that chemistry for a desire to outcome\nAnd ultimately to have that desire to outcome occur\nAnd the next generation as opposed to waiting for a slow evolutionary process as his is really what so spectacular here and now we're reading that the research can be used to create things like more environmentally friendly chemicals also pharmaceuticals what are some of the real world applications as\nWell to be able to use the uh the molecular machinery within a sell to make chemical compounds are proteins that's what sells normally do anyway but to be able to ask that sell\nTo make a specific molecule fist where the real creativity comes in so imagine being able to provide a set of instructions too simple cells\nAnd have those cells repeat that process over and over again under very mild conditions the chemistry suddenly becomes a lot more interesting because we can do some very complex\nChemical reactions that do them in a very clean environment\nAnd so really the the sky's the limit in terms of identifying molecular systems that we could imagine making in chemistry environment like a beaker but doing it\nShe's an example I'm of a natural process God created through um a an organism like like you used helps our bread rise in the war on generates a ethanol or alcohol and the production of beer or wine okay let's talk about one\nOf the winners Francis Arnold of Cal Tech here's a recording of her getting called late in the night by someone from the committee to tell her that she had one and she was remarkably calm\nYou you're away from home so perhaps some projects protected from the image it on the slopes has to happen today\nI don't know I think I Can't reach my show yes I Would say that I lost my house [laughter]\nAll right so Francis Arnold it only the fifth woman to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry yesterday we reported on ... district Linda Canadian scientists only the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics for her work\nWhat does all of that mean for science and specifically for for you and chemistry\n[noise] well I also point out that come from what I can tell this is the first time that women in physics and chemistry or recognized as laureates and the same year [noise] um and but you're absolutely right in the case of professor Arnold\n... she's the fifth woman's and prior to that it was ... Hodgkin's and Nineteen sixty four that was recognized and then you start going way back to St Marie Curie and Nineteen eleven and then actually her daughter um several uh two decades later so\nFor us in the American Chemical Society where we're at the center for me personally were really advocating for\nBroadening the participation in the chemical science is specifically\nUm for folks from all different backgrounds and and perspectives and for us recognizing the the fact that professor Arnold work has has risen to these levels is just it's just fantastic\nPeter door how is president of the American Chemical Society he's there at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas a thank you so much for talking with us\nThank you very much Peter and I'm a ... I Wish everyone a great day\n\nIf you're in Durango and it's because lego sculptures had been popping up around Durango for the past couple of years it's the ... bridge I'm the lego bomber from Colorado Public radio Stephanie will has the story [noise]\nThan Britain asked me to meet him outside a coffee shop ... into where new ... perhaps if he could identify me I have lights and I keep an eye out for an adult now and it did the instead and greeted by a blonde haired eleven year old\nHe tells me he's than the Lakers on her and take me on a tour of ... kids are\nThis Sam leads me to like it was called truth around the town many are surprisingly discreet you have to look up or down to the one posted outside businesses and I almost missed the Lakers and the sign for the old main post office they look like they're part of the don't work\nAnd the post office is cool to\nWe put it up only a couple of days ago but\nOur tour and an old junior high school that's been converted into space for yoga and art classes there we find a bright green centipede like lego creature crawling up a wall I play along with than\nI finally called them out on his roots and remind him I've seen pictures of the actual than Britain\nWell they're taking photos of the older me okay\nThe older Sam who is was born in the sixties I meet the older than I Am today [noise] probably okay can you grow up right now okay [laughter]\nYounger sand disappears down stairwells an older than emerges from around the buildings are you the older than\n[laughter]\nNice to meet you [laughter]\nMy getting punched me to get that young [laughter]\nI'm I learned Britain's impersonator is no can't sit in one of his assistant give the pockets them but when Britain began lego bombing two years ago it was a solo endeavor\nI was just really frustrated one night I'm On my bed and I'm I'm not ordinarily are praying man but I Try to uh gave it a try got nothing and just told me ... and decided to go into something\nHe happened to have hundreds of lego lying around because he teaches lego robotic through his own business called alpine educational associate\nSo I just took all these lego some plastered on a on a ...\nBut now many of his young lego robotic students helped him construct ... around the city including places like Starbucks or the window at the drive through pharmacy at Walter\nReed [noise] isn't that the nation from radio [noise]\nAnd I'm taking her on a tour\nMonitors Solomon who goes by ... is a senior pharmacy technician at ... through the drive through intercom system she told me that she loves having the Lakers coach for their\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W. B. U. R. Boston and your NPR\nProjects from minor repairs to major re models homeowners can read reviews of local throws a book appointments online at home advisor dot com\nAnd do would you be you are in the Boston Globe was last seen the new true crime podcast sponsored by Samuel Adams investigating the largest unsolved art heist in history was an an apple pie August\nIt's here and now it was the part about the laughter that got me that's what my male friends said to me he said it was when Dr Christine Blasey Ford said in her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged assault was the laughter for her to alleged attackers\nThey were having a good time she said\nAt my expense my friends said when he heard that\nThat was what threw him back over half a century ago he was seven had gone to visit a cousin who's moved to another state there were three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target\nWe're going to catch treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pin him down he said just like glassy Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling\nBut then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left and my friend now well over sixty pretty strong decried if that memory\nA lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lousy Ford and many of his supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked for they believe that\nAnd others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying\nThe national sexual assault hotline reported the busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than three thousand calls\nSeven hundred and thirty eight percent increase on a micro level at Chicago's rape crisis hotline cause tripled\nAnd Brazil oh heads the clinical program at the YWCA of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all three of the city's rape crisis centers she joined us from Chicago and welcome thank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like\nBeen very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which\nIs our nearly doubled from the weeks prior and five times as many calls as two weeks ago or say on friday or calls were a little more than double from the weeks prior and we're continuing to see an increase calling and writing and what are people saying we're hearing\nWe had a caller tell our staff they had their first flash back in three years after listening to Dr Ford's testimony we're hearing from male survivors that the testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact\nAnd we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault um so the symptoms and stress reaction but the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody had a flashback you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that yeah\nAbsolutely through a flashback is for a survivor\nOr re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if\nThey're right back in that moment to they they feel their heart pounding ah they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this the head of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pin down and I had another friend telling me just imagine you regarding who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered those from out in her nose\nAnd his friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone you know who can now\nDo this and you can't breathe ... said she thought she was going to accidently be killed you know in other words this is it about sex did do people do people when they come for help or when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of their trauma they're talking about\nIt and the feeling of being choked of being a being a mobilized of being frozen we know that when we experienced trauma\nOur brain is going to react typically one of three ways we are going to fight we're going experience afraid or we're going to fleet and what lousy Ford is reporting diner testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less intense feeling of fear\nAnd we're hearing about as well from the survivors that we work with\nUsually people has a flashback he's also explain to us that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor read I didn't sing too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean that means that\nBack to that moment and we know what we talked a survivor is about their trauma narrative as\nThey are able to define are frequently what the worst part of that experience was\nAnd so it might be the worst part related to the the disclosure it might be the worst part\nRelated to their response of the alleged offender but we know that survivors have the capacity because of all the way the trauma is stored in the brain to literally re presents themselves and re experience that trauma an incredibly intense way\nWell some of us thought that she actually sounded Fifteen times and I didn't know if that's what you meant that she was actually going back to that moment\nThat was certainly my sense of her when she was testifying I wouldn't be able to speak to a what that was exactly like for her time yes yes yeah look\nThe majority leader of the New Jersey state house an eighty year old the Retta Weinberg\nAfter watching the hearings revealed that she'd been grouped in forcibly kissed by man when she was Thirteen Shireen Ghorbani Utah congressional candidate went public with her sexual attack when she was eight years old\nBette Davis President Reagan's daughter a reveal that she'd been raped by him using executive Chris Wallace of Fox News anchor went on the air to talk about how his two daughters confronted him to tell him that there were things happening in their high school that he didn't know\n... you know what's happening to his daughters maybe not the full attacks that we've been hearing about but something very troubling to him so this has started this national conversation\nBut on the other hand Brett Kavanaugh I strongly denying that this happened Christine Blasey Ford is not believe a lot of people including its themes President Trump who initially said he found her credible but last night as you well know in a in a rally mocked her lips was new and then\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get started on remember when it was the point I don't remember how many years [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nAnd to deal again from the Chicago rape crisis centers\nWhat happens when you have this huge national dialogue and people are feeling states to come out and tell their stories and then suddenly there is a pivot now we're hearing the president and his son say it's a dangerous time for men who are being falsely accused\nWe're hearing from callers that they're feeling just mad but there will never be enough detail to convince\nYou mean and they know that they will not be able to recall one hundred percent of the details and this fact about traumatic stress reactions the way the brain and the body processes trauma is being used against survivors to invalidate their experience\nBecause of Dr Ford said and it's so many others have said anybody who's had a traumatic experience of any kind of knows you're taken out of yourself you do forget some of the details I mean that's not uncommon\nCorrect and that's the way that the brain and body works to protect survivors and it's a part of trauma and so to expect a survivor to recall the exact details of a sexual assault weapons out assault was five days ago five weeks five months five years for Fifteen Years\nReally lives the incredible complexity of the way that the brain operates and and honestly contributes to victim blaming and myth making around sexual assault and sexual violence\nAnd we should say that Christine Blasey Ford did describe some of the things the president said that she did and but at any rate uh others has said it's like trying to describe a nightmare so we await the FBI investigation and the Senate decision tomorrow what do you what are you bracing for\nWe're bracing for increased calls a tour hotline we're bracing for increased costs for counseling we're bracing for our current clients experiencing triggers\nAnd I think survivor is find themselves you know in this incredibly powerful moment caught between pressure to come forward and a feeling that their experience will be invalidated I think this is an incredibly critical moment\nFor our country for our government for survivors of sexual violence across the country\nThat tempers yellow she had to clinical program that's why do you see a a metropolitan Chicago they run the hotlines and all three rape crisis centers there and thank you so much thank you [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Pullman", "day": "03"}
