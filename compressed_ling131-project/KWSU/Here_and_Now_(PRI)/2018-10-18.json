see may jealous and joins us now to talk about a welcome to hear now thank you\nSo you're asking people to download this app sky fees\nWhat are you hoping that will do\nWhat we're asking them to share what happened when they look up at the sky daytime are nighttime for twenty four hours around the globe\nYou know just the simple act of connecting through looking up going outside looking up will help us understand maybe a little bit more about each other just so just a tiny bit more connected around the planet so you know some people will look up in the sky and they will feel love bill so wholesale still\nSome people may feel afraid they may still wonder are expensive and how they express that is what we want to capture and we want to have a shared with people in real time\nSo it's not just you're going to take these photos and you've got to put them up we're going to display them to the world in real time on a digital globe that people can then and they can look at that can expand they could go to different folks around the world so I can no\nIn Houston, Texas what someone is thinking in New Zealand [noise] so I\nI have to say I love looking up at the night sky and talk to the last couple of Marjah guy period yeah nice guy right there and a nice guy well but but in the sky period and I'm and in the last couple of months we've been able to see for planets uh every single night to Mars Saturn Jupiter and I'm Venus\nAnd I've I've taken great pride in telling people about that but the other ... feeling that I often have when I look up because I live in a city is disappointment that I can see more because of there's the light pollution\nSo I I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down because so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet\nLet's start looking up and be more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were saying what people are we're even seeing our impact up on this planet\nAnd so we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people said we're always talking about stars right\nBut it's really about our planet when I was up in space I saw the earth when it was day and I saw the earth when it was night and each time there's this then you shouldn't bring layers of light that is our atmosphere\nNice that our home is on the planet and then while we're connected to the greater universe which I'm very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet and we have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nWill so it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to climate change [noise]\nWell I Want people to pay attention to climate change pollution but to war because he had a good thing\nToday we had these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge\nBut we don't use them at least effectively because I don't think that we really see our soldiers connected than we really don't see that what I Do in my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet\nSo yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the sides of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy and we grow enough food to feed everyone on the planet yet we wasted and at the same time\nWhenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster\nWe really care about each other but that carried only happen\nWhen we're come face to face that\nI can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up to the sky something that's common to all of us look up and just say what do you feel when that happened\nI think a lot of human about astronaut like you think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you now as you also have a deep view of earth that's the only a handful of people laugh\nAnd you know I actually have a view of earth and I think we all can have that view of earth is what happened when I was a little kid when I used to look up\nAnd imagine that some child on the other side of the earth was looking at the same thing I was looking at and I wonder what this was like and so it felt really really comfortable I felt really good to me to know that we were connected that way we were calling\nThe ... that we have that's completely ... we're calling it\nGuy feet at right guy selfie [laughter] and that sort of like our connection between\nAnd again people can go to our website here no doubt Oregon learn more about what what you want them to do in terms of this app sky fee but I just want to ask you a couple of questions that we have you because you were in space you're the principle of the one hundred years starship project which seeks to enable interstellar human space flight by Twenty one twelve\nOr do you think that we're going to need to leave the earth and the next hundred years\nSo let's I Want to hear your starship is about making sure the capabilities for human interstellar flight exists within a hundred years and it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh\nThe technology and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of uh the governance in terms of you know human biology and health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it\nBut here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on this planet we can forget about anything else and even if we're able to get five hundred people on Mars what five hundred people are we going to end right right who gets to decide\nI Would rather I understand and make sure that we're keeping this planet well then counting on a plan B now what's fascinating and what's incredible about space exploration is it is it really changed fundamentally\nHow we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet\nThrough being able to look back down at our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study Venus we've been able to study Mars and understand how planets form in what could happen to them yet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live on a planet we live on our own space ship and the only thing that's happening it's we have to figure out as a crew\nHow to live together that means that we don't foul our planet through pollution but we only do that if I understand that what I Do changes what happens is that the people\nThat we understand that we have to live on the planet in our behavior makes a difference\nThere are now are a number a small number but a number of African American women who have gone into space but you'll always be the first ... what does that mean to you [noise]\nDo it it was really interesting to me because not only with the first African American woman but I was the first woman of color in the entire world to go up in space and it's a little girl growing up on us outside of Chicago there is no way that I Would have imagined\nI would've thought that we would have had lots and lots of other people going up\nBut being that being the first one was called where in the world is going to say what I realized that my responsibility is including other people\nBoth in yes being space explorers whether it's being the the rocket science and the suit technician you know are being a crew members\nTo involve them in space exploration\nYet even as a port in is making sure that we understand the individual on the planet have a right to be involved with space exploration that they understand the impact\nOf this technology and how profound that can be to help us build a better world you want to go back into space again [noise] [noise] well you know what

I'm Out of the young I'm Jeremy hops and it's here and now secretary of state Mike Pompeo said this morning that he wants to get the Saudis more time to finish investigating the disappearance of Saudi journalist ... G before the United states decides how to respond\nWell I think it's important for us all to remember to wherever you want to say I think thirty two all along strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia to continue to be important counterterrorism partners\nCustody of her to holy sites are there and important strategic Hawaiian of the United states we need to be mindful of that as well\nThe United states also has important economic ties to Saudi Arabia and joining us now to talk about that as far as that host of the podcast full disclosure Robin let's start with oil how much oil does the U.S imports from Saudi Arabia\nLook that's about Thirteen million dollars of imported Saudi oil and that's a about four percent of the dollar amount consumed it's actually not\nTen years and what about us government bonds we've been hearing in recent days that the Saudis own a lot there one of the biggest foreign buyers of us treasuries\nYeah look it was last clocked at a hundred and sixty five billion dollars of US government debt this summer which sounds like a lot but then you look at the likes of China and Japan which have more than a trillion dollars each\nFees are the two biggest foreign holders of U.S government's securities they could if they wanted kind of hold us hostage on that but it cuts both ways the Saudis they really can't do it a oil shipments our dollar denominated for the most part they need a stable dollar\nThey are very threatened by too strong a dollar so it's a situation where you really have to put it in perspective\nAnother important part of the relationship that has come up is arms or the president of the United states has mentioned that the Saudis by billions of dollars\nOf arms from the U.S he says a hundred and ten billion that number is disputed but then when you heard this from a a fan of President Trump's evangelist Pat Robertson who spoke earlier this week on a seven hundred club\nWe rarely alarmist thing everybody on an opinion on this line corners of the hundred and Ninety million dollars is huge and they only have a lot of jobs that I don't think you know a lot of money coming to our coffers and are not something she want to blow up a willy nilly\nSo Pat Robertson they're telling President Trump maybe not to go too tough on the Saudis if it is found that they have something to do with a ... death\nSaudi Arabia still counts for less than one percent of the United states international trade through this summer and when you look at arm's you see that hundred billion dollar figure bandied about it's actually three point two billion dollars of defense exports I think the president and the secretary of state to kind of want to secure this great relationship and that\nTrump winter Riyadh he posted to Saudi prince here and he had these enormous fails and that stuff that he could sell to defense contractors in a in a midterm election year in reality the numbers are far smaller on an annual wise basis\nOne other thing I Want to ask you about is the tech industry um we we were hearing that Hoover\nHas a big investment from Saudi Arabia we remembered that when Iran mosque famously said he was going to take a Tesla a public at four hundred and twenty dollars a share part of that was about having a big investment from Saudi Arabia\n\nFunding for here and now comes from WVU are Boston and carbon night

such an impact\nWell and the impact included you do in your home run hit\nYes it was it was a heavily damaged in pretty much it it it is destroyed the structure stood the uh house basically over pressurized and blue part of my roof off and we're hoping to get some some adjusted today\nYou know well I'm Sorry to hear about that but we know you're you're in good company they're just given that some nail in what Mariana looks and feels like\nIt does look like I have a I spent Twenty one years in the military and it it's the damage is it just off the scales bad and buildings down almost every country has been affected snapped off halfway up and it it's a landscape I've never seen people coming back that have used to live here and come back so they don't even recognize a town\nLike Kenny appraise encourage he told a camper bay to be in that keep guessing that Ninety ... Ninety percent of the home and the whole county caffeine county we began and she actually an aerial pictures that you had\nA sense that we ... we had a crew go out and take a look and they gave us estimation that approximately five hundred and eighty two structures that they were able to look at were severely damaged four hundred plus\nAre completely destroy so you're looking at a thousand structures have been just damaged or destroyed\nNow with Gulf powers for this story they had to rebuild the entire electrical grid and ran a senator patchwork a city and a cooperative utility\nAnd then after big storms in two thousand five and six eternity we tone during my teaching improved a power line you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for these storms\nDo you think there was a fan of you to do that or do you think anything could has been done\nI can say personally and professionally that the power companies did everything they could do\nI can tell you unequivocal if they do an unbelievably awesome and difficult job and they have had very aggressive programs to bring back those trees to upgrade the grid and I see people putting power lines underground and yes that is is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power\nSome of the issues because I I think we heard in one report that the rising is out in one area but it's because they're underground cables were affected\nAnd that's happened because people don't realize fiber does run the twin towers and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood is just they were so much to breed them they could not get back to ensure the propane tanks refill for the generator so the generators stopped until they were not transmitting\nNot you've got the personnel here but also the professional what do you think should happen a measure to improve communication among the utility companies and another to find a study on storm response failed in the state legislature twenty Seventeen do you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level\nOr you know emergency convening on what to do going forward\nOr looking at an infrastructure in this country that is fifty some of it's a hundred years old we need to take a very hard and fast look at all are critical infrastructure issue we've got to do to fix it\nLike asking Romney just briefly um does there have to be more of an acknowledgement that that something is happening because of climate change\nI I don't know if it was so much climate change is it is is just a natural process that occurs over the years\nYou don't think this is I mean you're looking at an hour inland from the coast ... a town wiped out and you know every scientist worth their mental saying that uh this is a direct result of warming waters\nAnd and I'm I'm sure there might be some issues with that but I'll be honest with me and my level it's not a question of climate change is a question of changing the climate of people getting ready for these things and I could always guarantee this will change the climate of my community and the attitude of those in this area\nWell Rodney ... and they're in Jackson County and Mariana Florida we wish you the best case thank you very much [noise]\n\nParts of the country are lucky enough to be in pairs season so we want to take a closer look with here now resident Jeff ...\nWho is in the studio Hi Hi Robyn you know I have to say and one of those people I Love pears I think they are an art form I have ... cookbooks pictures of pairs and all I Do use them in Dallas we looked she\nSaid what your whole pair world about getting blown out of the car and say that about ... okay well the most common one that we see in\nGrocery stores and stuff on Jew our hands you know um there is a red and chew and then there's also a bright green line which is kind of an egg shape they tend to\nYou're gonna find as I describe these that it's incredibly versatile fruit most or all of them can be cooked as well as the raw and they are some white if not completely interchangeable how the dark brown ones that seemed to have a tougher skinned okay so that's called an ancient pair and I caught one up\nFor you right there they are very crunchy very tart\nSweet also these are best eaten raw Timmy and Asian pair tastes like a pair and meeting with a water chestnut and it's got that wonderful crunch and a little bit of juicy nuts and wonderful and salads wonderful graded also\nStart let's another very common variety very sweet red and green as well they are crest they are wonderful texture for poaching what I Love about them is they retain their shape when you cook them there's also boss pairs same deal\nVery earthy flavor and ... parents have any long needed neck which is really fun because when you poach them it has this elegant long to talk about the poached because we have\nOne I did it seems so hard\nI'm really glad you said that because I Am going to absolutely show you how wrong you are okay All right here's what I did reading I peeled the pair but I kept the stem on yeah okay I peeled it have you with me naked naked and I took a cup of sugar\nAnd a couple of white wine and two cups of water and I boil them I could add a cinnamon stick I could add some fresh ginger to that\nI let it cook down that's called the simple syrup and\nI'd place my naked as you call them pairs into the syrup and I let them cook for about twenty five to thirty minutes and what happens is the parent releases its Jews into the syrup\nAnd the parents than Cokes in this week delicious ginger syrup it can be made well ahead of time it keeps in syrup you can do that for breakfast you could eat that as part of a salad\nBut you certainly could serve that for dessert you don't need whipped cream it's healthy it's light and I think it's so refreshing\nMy brain yeah\nBut the other thing about Paris is that they swing both ways they're savory and they're also clearly sweet so I made a savory salad that's a little bit different than a normal pear salad I took 'em in this case I Believe I use a Bartlett pair my peel did I put it together\nThen I have fresh spinach and fall greens and I put my roasted pear around it and I took some French bread or baguette toasted in thin slices and spread blue cheese on top\nAnd I ... in a little bit of maple syrup see you have crunchy green tart\nPungent from the blue cheese and sweet and voluptuous from the pairs and the phone oh and there's also sun dried cranberries seasonal specialty in the event of grad okay we have this what is this this is an upside down ... that you probably heard of upside down pineapple game and it's very similar\nI used to variety I use comments I use a um\nFor a rally pair which are smallish that means trout in German and it's got a wonderful from heart flavor and then I also used a ... pair so I melted some butter and brown sugar and let that cook and then I laid the parents down in that\nAnd Mary Ellen thanks for joining us [noise] funding\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W.

Corrine maybe not a household name but some think it should be and that's where we turn for this week's DJ session a ba Corrine edition [noise]\nFifty drawn about its host of morning W. I. L. L. in Urbana, Illinois Dick welcome back\nJeremy it's great to be back thank you had you wanted us to start with the menu at from the string quintet in e major this is played by the Smithsonian Chamber Players [noise]\n\n\n\nVery familiar to know this was actually made famous\nAnd from a widow in London and they say they're a string quartet that just want to use the room to practice [noise] uh this is the song that they play I've heard this and a lot of movies sense that tell us about it [noise] if\nAnybody has ever said they haven't heard anything of Luigi ... 'cause we have in the day for his peace and in our time it became famous in the Nineteen fifties in that film but I understand that in the late Nineteen century [noise]\nThe arrangements that were made this piece went viral and it's time you could say there were range means for\nA Mandel lesions for piano for saxophone for a capella choir with a Latin text added so this piece has been popular\nWell before Nineteen fifty five the fun thing about the lady killers and to use in the film this was a word that's written for a string quartet to violins viola\nShallow was an additional cello and now there's a joke about the film it's either an error in the film or it's an additional joking that these crooks posed as a string quintet was an additional viola\nAnd not with a cello somebody should've been onto this these guys are walking around without a second child has\nYou know the other film that it's in one of my favorites is terrorists pillars day off this is what they play when they go into the fancy restaurant in Chicago and try to get it and\nWhether or not supposed to be but it's it's been in a lot uh I Wonder what's going to actually to another version of the same piece this is the saint Paul chamber orchestra with Bobby McFerrin conducting an on vocals [noise]\n\n\nYou know when I said Bobby McFerrin Ansel 'cause I was waiting to find out what that meant exactly but there you have that he's not singing necessarily but he is a coming on to the to the tin\nBobby McFerrin just being ... I think it's a fascinating arrangement of for our time if you like this piece you should know that Luigi ... wrote over a hundred string quintet this is one simple\nThe younger brother of the Spanish king dome release and while he was doing it he was writing string quartets royalty and playing the additional cello himself so he was doing this to the she could play along with them and then he would also writes\nStream quintet sport depression king who was the cellist so he had a lot of opportunities to write to string queen tests and string quartets in addition to other cheaper music what\nDo we know about what influence ... who influenced him\nWhere he was a cellist early on he learned the cello he also learn singing his father was a double bass player he and his father were playing in orchestras and you realize that he couldn't make a living just by being a cello virtuoso that you had to compose music so he began to compose music\nAnd he ends up getting very wealthy patrons who demand a certain kind of music and that seemed to influence his writing chamber music rather than say a president at the time\nWell let's go to another uh for ... and this is the cello concerto in gene major performed by the Canadian topple music orchestra\nAnd honor bills ... on the chosen by Jean [noise]\nWhat you're ... or something you have to admire this it's it's a lot of playing and then they can sure does there's a lot of rich rustic writing as well and I think those two things sort of defined book reading in many ways he was a virtuoso and wrote\nParts for a cellist in his country does and he's also known for having the gifted in writing melodies we kind of wonder if he if he would've ever written more than a couple\nIn ...\nOkay now to one of his symphonies this is the symphony number three in gene age are played by the London Mozart players [noise]\nOr\n\n\nOne of the things that I hear they're into this was obviously recorded in a big hole which I Love that you can tell that by listening there but what do you hear that tells you something is a book or in a peace [noise]\nYou could hear again this gift for ... and he's writing this in a symphony heightened was writing symphony is at the time it's been suggested that book arena was sued detail oriented that maybe he didn't have\nAn ear for the architecture of a full symphony or if it's funny there is a contemporary book greedy violinist composer ... ... and his famous wind\nThat if the almighty wish to speak through music he would be that of heightened if the almighty wish to listen to music we'd be data poker and book really had that gift for melody and had the gift for the detail and you can hear that just in this a portion of the symphony number three by ...\nWhy do you think then that he is not as well known as Mozart Beethoven Chopin Tchaikovsky that others\nCould be that most of his music is cheaper music\nAnd I would say that the appeal of chamber music is not as great and see the appeal\nFor orchestral music and it's not that he didn't write orchestral music and I think it's becoming a little bit better known but I think compared to those other composers there isn't as much of it and I think that's one of the reasons why it's not as popular in our time\nThat the victim ... who is host of classic mornings and W.
