worldwide reaction including from first lady Michelle Obama who had this to say the following month [noise]\nLike millions of people across the globe\nOutraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping more than two hundred Nigerian girls from their school dormitory in the middle of a night but\nThen what happened to those girls some managed to escape right away Twenty one were released in October twenty sixteen and in May of twenty Seventeen eighty two more were released\nTheir stories told the new HBO documentary stone daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram it airs on HBO tonight and joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha how much I think he said the girls that we first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram they're living in a compound apart from their families\nAnd their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nYeah it was a part of the condition of the access we always needs to kid the access with the government consent in any way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the go about what's happened to the gym three is that they were held by both her um bland partly a\nI mean they was you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative but also we the girls were released in may we started filming with them in the government's safe house in early July\n... they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks so it was quite rules they um with still protesting what had happened to them\nSo that was part of it it wasn't for us we're not ... to push them into reliving and telling his what had happened that we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to buddy ... any time we went to go\nI think the government also I wanted to monitor how the rest of the world on Nigeria the the girl time in captivity because they were held for three years before an association with down and they were really well\nWhat do we know about their time in captivity what would what it was like\nWell they they um they was free to speak to her as they did give his diaries discreetly it and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't good that they were forced to marry if not they would have the\nWhat they called us and the full Boko Haram treatment [noise] uh and and so what we do is the uh the do the book goes who hate and we're actually just the tip of the ice but there are thousands of girls in Nigeria who were taken by by the around\nWho are free to speak and they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is so through that testimony we get a sense of what happened to the ... girls as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because uh you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one\nGirl in your film who was married had a kid ah with somebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the sound and that and you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a ... or you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave than you know life is not taught to start to question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a cell that the Gulf felt like they were right\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it stay [noise] gee you know she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we first met ... like she\nDid she did tell us I Love my baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well uh yeah and I ended up being made into child so\nHe's on men here you have to pet have either been kidnapped or killed during the school [noise]\nSay ... been kidnapped and children but also older men and some of them are forced to pick up on and fight\nAnd then when the military engage with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill and arrest or people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching how terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been kidnapped but they've just flooded their town out of fear of book around they're living in these tent camps um that this wasn't getting more attention globally\nYeah in the phone and I think all the focus has been on area\nAnd yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns and these they called an ID Peter ... a intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run by a car I'm you know they don't just could not then button and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up to have any more even though places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main town it's incredibly dangerous producer safety by numbers on that fled the food aid is going to see how if you want food and you won't live that's why you have to run\nAnd the ... the al ... but then a lot of uh I I Love the tiny displaced people end up living within the community say\nDespite the fact that they can die as some fair towards people who have escaped Boko Haram but they've also been incredibly welcoming to the number of displaced people who have come tomato Goree\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they try to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nI mean I'm made a gory it then I kind of normal frontline will would say it that it's it's controlled it miniaturize control that I Nigerian military and\nTheir content infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night it happened to be the end of Ramadan that was six\nSo her I'm uses young mostly young women I've to side bomb and they stopped them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they managed to make it in Tibet sued the city\nAnd say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal frontline once again you just don't know why the threat is coming from and where and when I said that's a lot of mistrust [noise]\nWhat about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and try to have a hopeful future or the government is making it possible for some to attend college including some who managed to escape into one of them from your from\n[noise] in my head I think [noise] I Know in the past him [noise] and it has changed my life [noise] now on I mean I never told me he's All right ...

the networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content here's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy\nFor more thought afterward\nLive for the dishes like Google thing\nHere and now media analyst John Carroll joins us now and John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with ranking behind this\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes in many people do that audiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots\nAnd also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new ...\nAren't let's take this first change Fox is calling it the night and these nine second sixty second very sorry to be nine sixty seconds break jazz pods jazz parts with them in\nThe jazz is just a and Z which means that traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually a second year this has got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nIs that also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new concept is really adds in sheep's clothing to him last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute blocker branded content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and uh and other Mars candy ... brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in prime time by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for the\nShow the financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume to advertisers like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth so this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain it All right\nJohn Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much thank you so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship\nOur industries they're also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nSam your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost turned fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so get around really allows us to address this problem of car over population by using the cars we already own so instead of buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership is that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about this specific how get around works right now it's available in what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars around you and then what\nYeah so you don't want her up you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like to rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you pick that car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nAnd lock the doors and try one and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to lead to a Porsche people share all sorts of course\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's Toronto which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\n[noise] no we think this is a massive opportunity to disrupting a trillion dollar market which has car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access to more this market Chris for all players\nSome of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um Cox Automotive reason\nIn Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent what do you what do you think about that I mean are people really that eager to rent their car from a stranger when they could just jumping all this\nIs why I don't know the methodology on the Koch study um I I certainly know what we've seen and it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen\nSo you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers is that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely an ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing\nThey need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set of solutions to the marketplace so you believe people really do want to live without a car I think if you offered them mobility an equivalent level as you get today from ownership that's absolutely true you know\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for the money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partner with some some great companies like an over so it was continue investing those partnerships and expanding our our roster\nPartners well speaking of labor and Toyota me neither company is also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and it's something that we've since day one than sort of very aware of in fact it taught him was cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if your car could drive itself\nWould you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day he'd probably the other people use it and it's maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just you know it makes sense so we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those carts be used by more people different use cases\nAnd in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opens a lot more opportunity as to what can be done through a you know a marketplace get around or checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to them\nJust thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road I taught in the city of goals are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me then drop it off and then they would\nA mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where you know the cars you know today is different the foreign factors of those cars have changed and you know fundamentally we're talking about a sort of a fluid network of cars that will be operating in around cities and outside of cities in suburban areas\nUm any of those curves might be self driving but they're fundamentally not you know self cleaning or self maintaining\nUntil there's a lot of infrastructure and sort of network function is required to sort of operate those vehicles and that's very close even what we do today right we help owners\nShare cars efficiently in urban centers across the United states and we work with partners you know who helped service those cars or keep them on line and and continue to operate the\nNetwork and so we feed the opportunity there's something that's pretty large\nFunding

behavior in in the region and surely\nIran has been engaged to proxy terror groups in malign behavior especially targeting Israel but also elsewhere I mean a Saudi Arabia claims that Iran is meddling in Yemen and Yemenis targeting Saudi Arabia and that's why Saudi Arabia and Yemen but at any rate\nUh I don't see how\nA condoning what happened even though we have an incomplete a picture of what happened is in the U.S interest and therefore I think that a sanctions against Saudi Arabia if we have proof that there was a murder here are appropriate but I also\nAh suggest that perhaps the thirty three year old crown prince\nA has a some some growing up maturing to do and that it might make sense from the Saudi point of view it's not something the U.S would dictate\nA to have a a you know some kind of a\nAdult supervision are there are so that excesses in his behavior\nWould stop happening I think that would be and Saudis interest I think that the the war in in Yemen has created the the largest could humanity to humanitarian catastrophe that we currently see and I think that this episode especially if\nThere was a Saudi cover up and plot uh to to do this is a really shocking and in every sense\nBut do you think that the Trump Administration which has been watching the war in Yemen go on for years now a\nHaven't put the pressure on the Saudis to uh stop it that this was going to change President Trump's relationship for example with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nI think the Trump Administration wants Saudi Arabia as a good ally in the middle east and also as a good trading partner I think those are two agendas that it has\nAnd ah I'm not against either agenda uh but what I'm against is condoning bad behavior or in order to make sure that agenda continues a I think we can do both and that is NBS\nThe reason we have that agenda I don't think so I think Saudi Arabia is the reason we have\nThat agenda and I'm just suggesting that the crown prince\n\nFunding

democratic Senator Bob Menendez an end as is facing a challenge from Republican newcomer Bob you get in\nThe paper rights but this is a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our senator record this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this race has a report with WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joe German so Sen Menendez trial for federal corruption\nCampaign of and he told voters this election is not about me it's about you and our country how has that been working out for him\n[noise] ah it's been a struggle for him I think it will be fair to say he has been struggling to break into the lead in this race he isn't a lead by um you know some recent public polls but it's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nWell and he has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with eminent as Syria's on Fox News earlier this month\nWe've been over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting with the jurors eons of every location in our state they want change they're embarrassed by this guy you know he violated federal law abused the power of his office\nDespite all of that there have been some Democrats high profile Democrats who have been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraising event how would you describe the support that he has among Democrats nationally\nNationally he's getting some support from the party to Senate majority pac just dropped several million into the race to cement Menendez has lead and in New Jersey Democrats largely are standing with him um uh you know top leaders in the party here senator Cory Booker his colleague in the Senate\nThey're all standing by him and I should note that his corruption trial ended in a mistrial so he was not found guilty by the jury he was however admonished by the Senate for ethics violations so when ... says he was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring to\nAnd what about Bob huge and he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking to USA Today\nAnd at the end of the day it's a question about just\nWho's judgment you want sitting in the Senate fighting\nOff you can raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not twice was re times for drugs that those cancer patients politically need\nNow he has blamed insurance companies for some of the costs of the drugs that his former company makes he's called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at ... again as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him\nWell it's true that his company or the company is called ... and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug revel in that they've doubled in less than a decade shooting would say that many patients have asthma\nThe companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up cell gene has also you know ... uh settle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes the weren't approved by the FDA but you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice\nHe he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied to Donald Trump he spent a hundred thousand dollars on the campaign to elect Donald Trump he he he went to the\nThe Republican convention so you know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's a he's a first time a political candidate but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump factor compared with Menendez is ethics issues\nYeah you would think a Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about um it keeps coming up in my conversations with people\nBut so do Menendez is ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know few tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and they're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nIt's been a long time since New Jersey had a competitive Senate election\n[noise] yeah um you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate New Jersey's pretty pretty reliably democratic in that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years\nNew Jersey is quite blue when you look at you know voter registration and things like that however these races do happen um you know New Jersey often\nDoes elect a Republican and and and ... them for a long time Republican congressmen frankly beyond those retiring this year after decades in Congress so it does happen but it's surprising this race it's surprising how close it is because of ... support and the party\nAnd just his popularity and previously\nThat is Joe Hernandez of W H y y talking about the Senate election in New Jersey Joe thank you you got it\nWell you know now that our

I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed\nAnd that's a time when social life is very important where teams are forming their identity when what really shapes and a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends\nAnd how they spend time with their friends has fundamentally shifted to go online social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who Sean this way of life who who decided that they don't want\nThat a lot of time they're spending too much time on their phones they well in their own words often describe themselves as addicted\nBut Ninety five percent of teens um had a smartphone now and it it is become it has become a normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to you and your friends text instantly to want to be the first to post a like an Instagram poses so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but Generation Z or our job is actually even more diverse than the millennial generation\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history\nAnd that's reflected in these big um surveys that I work with whether asked about um their experiences with um people from different backgrounds so say high school students of course because the high schools they go to a more diverse much more likely to have friends of other races and ethnicities too you know hang out with people from different backgrounds\nThat's definitely more common among ige and then it was just say ten years ago with the millennials\nWe mentioned nine eleven how do you think U.S foreign policy has shaped this generation\nWell\nThat's hard to tell from the the data that we have because um you know foreign policy is arguably it's changed the most in the last\nFew years with the Trump Administration and we don't have that survey data yet\nBut the U.S has been at war for the entire lives of many of these people\nTrue um but because there's not a draft\nRoad that hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nHowever companies marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to the millennials for example\nAnd they they do have to market it to this generation differently because there's there's such that big a generational shift I think a lot of them are picking up on the same trends that show up in these big surveys such as\nI Jen is really interested in safety is not something you usually associate with teens and young adults but in their conversation and what they say in um you know they're in their attitudes and in their behaviors\nThey're very interested in physical safety and what they call emotional safety and I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on\nAnd um I think is well that there's a lot more awareness around stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing as another theme\nThat many of these potential voters will actually vote Generation Z people\nI Wish I could say yes I'm\nBy statistics from past elections and what they say about their attitudes toward getting involved in politics and government in voting are not encouraging\nSo in these big surveys Eighteen year olds are now less likely to say they're interested in government or social issues or politics Dan teams were say Twenty years ago what do you think so um well I think because there's so many other things to do\nThere's always the possibility of a you know something new to see on I'm On social media or a new game to play or a new series to watch on Netflix and you know I think some ... I saw it in some of the interviews that I did a lot of teens\nYou know say well you know we have all these other things to do while we pay attention to the news I only do that if I had to do that for a class was very common response that I heard ...\nInteresting I mean I've had many conversations with people who are in this generation and I always find that yes they are definitely more reliant on their phones their mobile devices the Internet in general [noise] um but they're also often really smart I I'm quite impressed sometimes when I speak with them\nSo absolutely they're definitely smart I mean they've they've had access to all of this information and um they're they're quick thinkers on there's actually data showing that IQ has has gone up over the generations so I think yeah smart says is definitely not the issue\nSo obviously a generation Z is going to have to deal with some of these problems on their own as they get older and and and even right now what can those of us in the other generations due to to assist in any way with some of the problems of this generation\nWell I think we do need to be aware on just how\nSevere um the mental health crisis is right now among teens and young adults so there's a little awareness around that but not half as much as they as there should be\nThat we're seeing unprecedented levels of depression and self harm a among teens and young adults now and we need to have more resources and more awareness of the causes behind that and then more funding and awareness for\nJean ... who is professor of psychology at San Diego State University and author of I June gene thank you thank you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Pullman", "day": "22"}
