Smith who uh forward size was there\nA it includes drinking and it is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which ah his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which at that event reinforces even if that wasn't the date on which\nAn incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer\nWhich is something the cat and I went to great pains to deny\nKevin as your book has also become the focus of scrutiny this is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse reading from Kevin ... country\nHave view I don't know if it's ... or ... how do you pronounce that refers to flatulence we are sixteen\n[noise] okay [noise]\nAnd so when your friend mark judge said the same put the same thing as your book page back to you at the same meaning was flatulence\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection and we want to talk about flatulence onstage sixteen hundred year book page\nOn 'em game until about that's not what this means\nWell it's sort of unclear what boost means in that context right I mean I I I'm not really a booth truth or if you will on this particular subject I mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty wisely\nBut it seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious that a reference to drinking those maintenance of your book he tried to redirect away from the fact that they were talking about drinking heavily\nYou know he he said that the beach week routes club which is pretty obviously right in reference to him drinking Latin and vomiting was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of booth is ... however it relates to drinking the fact is that the year because he makes very clear that drinking was a big part of his high school experience\nAnd just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says it proved to reverse the anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse later talking with Kavanaugh about another term and is your book devil's triangle here is\nDevil's triangle [noise]\nDrinking game has the plates\nYour plate quarters you know ... supporters here\nWhat about that one and again I'm going to refer to Urban Dictionary and it says now because of what's happened in the last few days that are the devil's triangle is made up game of quarters with three cups or engineer triangle the rules are unknown because the inventor of the game Brett Kavanaugh could that explain them under oath\n[laughter] right so uh this is again this this is a bit of flying it's not really clear what the intended usage was at the time they are all sorts of uh of suggestions about it but one thing that I Will notice I went back and I looked at Google has a tool that allows you to search a books that they have indexed I went back and look to contemporaneous news reports\nYou know news ... likes to talk about flying high schoolers are using I saw no indication of either booth or devil's triangle the way in which Kavanaugh alleges they were used were actually contemporaneous uses of those terms\nSo we're we're we're diving pretty deep into\n... in an area that's sort of hard to evaluate a objectively and categorically but it seems pretty clear that no one besides Brett Kavanaugh says the devil's triangle is the thing that he said it was which is sort of ironic given that the whole thing is meant to refute an allegation that he says only one person had made\nI Want to play one more clip from the hearing this is senator Amy club which are pressing cabinet and his assertion that he never had memory lapses resulting from drinking\nOr you're saying there's never been a case where you drank how much you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened\nIf you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know have you\n[noise] could you answer the question judge and just to you that's not happening is that your answer\nYeah and I'm curious if you have I have no drinking check out in order to why thank you\nSo Chad ... who's a former yell classmate of Kevin ... says Kevin I had not told the truth about his drinking at Yale or is it plausible for him to tell senator club which are that he's never had memory loss from drinking\nAh I I mean it is it plausible I suppose theoretically it's plausible but we have a lot of contemporaneous evidence from people that knew him at the time who said he drank a lot too when he drank there were oftentimes in which he appeared to be incapacitated\nAh and there are lots of Jeff Sessions or from people who knew him then that it is hard to believe that he never would have been blackout drunk given how much he drunk and they'll heavily drank and of course this is the central central point if it was the case that he would still\nThe story that he says which isn't he doesn't he never I I did what Ford alleges it's quite possible he doesn't remember what it's doing what for legit so it's very important for him to establish that he never got blackout drunk because if he can establish that then that bolsters his defense of this event never happens well\nAnd also you know this is a person who wants to be a a justice on the Supreme Court and there are big questions here about whether he was telling the truth under oath to these senators that soon as a Jeff Flake the senator the Republican senator from Arizona and Chris Coons a Democrat\nOn sixty minutes over the weekend a talking with Scott Kelly of CBS\nIf judge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee nominations over ... type of thing so they're\nThey're both saying that that line to the committee would be a problem I mean how\nHow is this all playing out among the people that you're talking to at\nThis point well ...\n... one of the blue sort of fascinating things here is the extent to which\nThe sort of obvious white lies of him\nOr trying to downplay for example as your book injuries are sort of given a pass we sort of established as odd spectrum of these sorts of false words that are are going to be considered a disqualifying for Kavanaugh and that the European countries may not necessarily fit\nInto that category so it's a real sort of have to see but this is all politics right I mean flakes assertion that that would be disqualified will be absolutely heavily eleven by the fact that he needs to consider what the politics are of the decision that the ... and so to the extent that\nWe can say hey Kevin all said this thing about the yearbook which isn't exactly true\nWhat we're going to end up seeing inevitably and the evidence suggested this is what we're going to see is that people will simply say well yes but that's not really what I meant when I said that this would be disqualified\nFunding for here and now comes from that weren't readers of not

international challenges but I'm happy with the new agreement principally because I was happy with the olden Raymond\nAnd I can't imagine why someone who was profoundly troubled by the old agreement\nShould be happy with the new agreement so this is more in the nature of a publicity stunt then an international diplomatic act\nSo when President Trump said this is proof that my strategy worked that I put pressure on Canada and Mexico and I got what I wanted and our dairy farmers are going to be in better shape now you say what\nI say any changes are\nTiny compared to the overall economy the ill will we have created with respect to the Canadians and the Mexicans will have costs that will exceed any benefits\nThe ability of North America to remain unified when we face very serious challenges from Asia\nHas been constrained this has been the most short sighted of strategies for the most negligible games\nDo you feel the same way about what's happening these are the trade with China right now\nThink there are major issues in the U.S China trading relationship it seems to me the strategies we have used to go after them have been quite problematic\nThey emboldened the strongest in most hostile to the United states elements within the Chinese government\nThey encourage the Chinese\n[noise] which ultimately will reduce our leverage in influence they fail to mobilize the moral and political force of\nThe entire international community which has surely the most effective way\nTo influence Chinese behavior I think that any conscientious American administration would be addressing issues about\nChinese trade practices and in particular the ones who are relating to intellectual property but I don't think the strategy or the tactics has been well calculated to maximize\nLong run American interest and what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are filling up because of these terrorists that were collecting a lot more money on everything that is being brought in from China [noise] they're all kinds of ways of raising\nTaxes if you want tariffs our taxes\nThey are taxes this fall principally on the goods that people buy and the inputs the companies need in order to compete that's why their taxes that are particularly regrets\nAnd particularly inefficient and so there's something very odd about an administration that prides itself on its tax cutting focusing on cutting the taxes for corporations and raising the taxes on uh\nThe ordinary goods the toys that parents by for their kids have Christmas so are you surprised then that Republicans who have long campaigned on big tax cut her isn't being against taxes are not speaking up about these tariffs\nI've stopped being surprised at\nRepublican craven this in front of\nPresident Trump is clear and you know I'm an economist not a politician or a political scientist buddy it's quite clear that a Republican congressmen and senators are in great fear of a primary challenge\nSponsored and supported by President Trump and President Trump may not have a majority within America with him\nWithin the Republican Party and he's prepared to ruthlessly use that to impose party discipline\nAnd therefore he is able to a rally Republican congressmen and senators\nWho value their survival as political leaders more than their previous convictions\nTo stand by his side you know the book has moved somewhat out of fashion but John Kennedy wrote a great book called profiles in courage about senators who were guarded their\nCore beliefs\nAs being more important to them than their reelection I just wish we were seeing more profiles in courage or in the Senate these days on trade issues and frankly on some other issues as well\n[noise] what do you think of what the fed is doing right now they just raised interest rates again inflation is up above two percent unemployment below four percent right now or is it possible that the fed is keeping interest rates too low right now or what do you think\nI think the fed is right to recognize that had any error and letting inflation rise a little bit too much is likely to be a reversible error\nAt any error in terms of tipping the economy into recession is likely to take 'em very long time to reverse\nI'm One who believes that we have a very different economy than we used to therefore I think the approach that is being pursued is\nOkay and I would not be one uh to criticize it certainly not one to criticize it on the grounds that we should have it even more rapid increases in interest rates than we do I\nI have an interesting theory that I just heard from somebody in the banking industry in a major banking and he was saying that the unemployment rate may actually be getting so low that they're going to be a lot of people hired for jobs that they shouldn't have being paid too much money and that's where inflation is going to come from what do you think about that it's\nPossible uh there is some evidence that at the end of expansions there's a tendency for productivity growth to slow and that may be for the reason you're a companion suggests that ah when laborers in short supply\nIt seems to me that what is striking is\nHow slow any pressure for inflation is and perhaps that's because of the price discipline posed by foreign competition posed a buy a technology so I think it would take quite a lot to generate a substantial acceleration in America inflation\nI Want to ask you about one more thing which is that we're talking as the stock market is at record highs a lot of people are worried that you know we've been in an expansion for a long time now that have recession is on the way what are your thoughts at this point about that I'd\nBe surprised if some time in the next three years we didn't have\nA recession evidence is that it's very hard to predict recessions and so the fact that we don't see one coming doesn't to show us that one is not common I think you have risks and the geo political environment you have risks the fed will\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of WB or Boston and your NPR station\nStaples with printers printer ink on

this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nIt's here and now and we've spoken here over the years about\nEarly retirement a couple of who sold their home traveling in staying in other people's homes to save money millennials who work day and night to earn a million dollars and live off investment income or there's now a name for this it's called fire financial independence retire early\nAnd fire it on fire inspired in part by books like your money or your life and stoked on blogs podcast and read it message boards sharing ideas like how's hacking you buy a home rent out all the rooms you crash on the couch\nOr work at a place with free food Scott ... and his wife Taylor are on fire they were earning a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year living in a beach town driving a BMW and then\nLet's let Scott ... he joined us from Bend Oregon Scott welcome\nI thanks for having me well nice to speak with you and I understand you heard a pod cast with one of the gurus of this movement Mr money moustache this is Pete\nAsked me what was it that he said that made you and your wife so a ... change your lives you move you started saving you were determined to to retire what what what did you hear\nInitially what was so intriguing to me was he sounded so optimistic and um for someone who's living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year which is how he was introduced on that I cast\nThat was very interesting to me at that time I was actually looking for my own million dollar idea to kind of get out of the stresses that I felt from our spend the lifestyle\nAbout those stresses you are creative director at a creative agency and I imagine in the homes\nGoing on that's exactly right it was the unintentional lifestyle creep we originally moved into this little five hundred square foot apartment in this little beach town\nAnd our our costs were much lower than and you know as we got older uh and we had a baby or you know some of our knees were were changing but also our taste\nYou know we found ourselves eating out quite a bit we found ourselves are moving to a larger three bedroom apartment and you know we moved there when the recession was in full force but fast forward a couple of years and things were gaining steam and rents were going through the roof and you know beyond\nMy financial literacy wasn't in top shape at that time and so to hear that someone was that happy living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year as what was so intriguing to me in the beginning\nOf the other thing that happened is that your wife Taylor she looked at a retirement calculator\n[laughter] so uh once I started going down the rabbit hole and learning about some of these tactics and strategy is from from now my friends but at the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement calculator kind of understand our situation and when I first plug the numbers into what current spending was\nIt looked like we would probably be retiring in art eighties\nAnd uh and when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on reasonably based off of some major life changes uh I realized that we could probably retire in about ten years if we really stuck to it that's what put her over the edge\nOkay so this sense that you could be unburden from the cost of your own lifestyle that you could get out of maybe a rat race you've gotten into did you not like your job\nYou know it's funny I personally really like my job and for me it's not about work for me it was about a spring myself from\nThe idea of mandatory labor you know there's passion that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that felt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a potential for that I mean it was intoxicated\nOK so a couple of things first of all and you say this mandatory labor many of us just said you mean a job which is you know how the world turns around but what'd you and your wife did just to keep the story going it's it's a major part of this FIRE movement it's called arbitrage\nYou moved she had to move to a a less expensive towns here in Bend Oregon now but I just kind of car around something that I'm seeing from a lot of these people who are in the FIRE movement\nA lot of you seem really creative so you are making a documentary about your FIRE movement\nFilm director author [laughter]\nYou know it's funny I I've I've now met a lot of people in this fire community and the one thing that seems to stay very relevant truth that you know you don't meet a lot of people who are just straight up retired doing absolutely nothing right I haven't met anyone that's been like that\nAnd we should say there's different levels or this is according to our reading there's lean fire where people are extremely frugal fat fire where people have a more typical standard of living but they save and invest ... to fire you work part time at like a Starbucks [laughter] so you can get health insurance\nBut the in fact yeah the interesting part talking about that because\nThis isn't like decades ago um when Scott and Helen Nearing two incredible people\nDecided to live off the land and kick the rat race and they wrote a book called simple living I Can't recommended enough that the whole goal was not to make too big a footprint seeing that this isn't really that a lot of this is people who are working very hard to play the investment game\nAnd have enough investments that they can live off their investments which is very different you know and then kind of the hippie getting out of the rat race\nOne of the the main draw for me was the ease at which the investment strategy takes place and when I found out about index funds these low cost index funds\nAnd how much money you could save by not having a financial adviser you're centrally betting on the stock market which in its history has always gone up now it goes through these big dips and dive\nAnd if you can ride those waves if you can ride those lows you'll end up on the right side of that so when I realized it was as easy as I said it and forget it that was really really a a nice entry point for me\nWell and part of this in order to do this and there's a sort of a goal or in the FIRE movement of Seventy percent say that\nThe whole framework is really flexible if you increase your savings rate by ten percent you're ten percent better off\nMy wife and I made it to a Seventy percent savings rate and to be completely honest with you were absolutely miserable and we go to great lengths to get there the reason why we made the film and wrote the book is we're trying to share our story with people so that they can understand what it's like so that they can eliminate the excuses that stopping them\nFrom some of the changes you made to help save that money that even though you're miserable what were some of the things you were doing\nYeah I mean one of the things that we did was we set a whole ah adventure up to to go and find a new place to live we wanted to make sure that our quality of life would suffer you know there was a lot\nSome time living with our parents for a couple of months to save as much money as we possibly could get them a little bit of time with their new granddaughter and we thought that'd be a nice combo punch what we found was that are being in our mid thirties with a two year old living in the basement of our parents' house maybe with a little extreme maybe a bad idea\nAnd then on top of that I think there was a lot of unknowns are leaving a community behind that we we invested in that we loved leaving our friends leaving what we knew um and I think we we kind of dealt with that stuff ah while we were living in the parents and our parents base and\nBy the way people have pointed out this is something you can do if you don't have parents you can move in with or if you have a huge student loan debt or if you don't you know if you don't work at an area where you can read a high salary and then turn around and invested in your future so it's it's not for everyone\nBut so here you are doing this and I've been hearing of people doing fire with like one million one point two million one point five million invested that seems a lot of money but you're potentially going to live that many more years [noise] I mean have you ever thought about that\nOf course we definitely have thought about that and that's something that you know we were definitely a nervous about an ass a lot about in the beginning\nAnd there was a couple of things without it I think the first thing is the whole premise of financial independence and your investments making enough that it can sustain you is based off of this thing called the trinity study\nAnd it essentially a works out the map to be about Ninety eight percent chance that you won't run out of your a principal a investment over the course of Thirty years if you drop four percent off of that the ideas that the stock market continues to grow and if it continues to grow that has in the past and you can always dip a little bit off the top\nAnd you'll never run out of what you had it at the end of the day one of my dear friends and one of my favorite uh you know fire pot casters her name is Paula ... we were asking her this question and she said you know the worst case scenario is you go back to work\nI think for us the real point here was gaining financial literacy and understanding how money works in our life and what our relationship to money is\nAnd once we saw it as a tool and something that we had more power over to the freedom and the stress or that was relieved that the magical fire in the sense", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "02"}
