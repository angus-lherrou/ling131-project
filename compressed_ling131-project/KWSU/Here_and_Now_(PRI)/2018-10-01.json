I could do that\nWhen did you realize you had that skill\nI didn't realize until I was working in the place and I was told to go to new Scotland yard and get some testing done with don't just Davis because I was doing very well often find people from closed circuit television and I didn't have a clue I could do it until that point\nReally so and and and how does it work for you if you see a little bit of someone's face like the un ears sticking out from beneath the cap for instance or or an eyebrow is that enough\nIs leaves you'd be amazed last year ... from the back of the head from ... but those are\nThe very strange ability but when it when it comes off you are very excited the thing is every single time I\nLooked at ... nothing discussion on not just someone is probably in a row style and you'll find well it's a rock star Donald ... put me in a room full of people and pitches last amazing so you like that we love it and it ...\nIt's not a burden so in other words I see thousands of faces everyday to I wouldn't want to remember each of the details that I pick up\nIt can be a burden speak on it because you could be walking down the street and someone would walk into what you they might smile she think oh\nKnow that person because you recognize the face but you don't actually know them ... and then like a I don't really know you at the problem is because if you will in the same area qualify\nElizabeth faced a memory or is it involuntary is involuntary um you don't really have to try\nYou can just be walking down the street you'll see that ... many times I recognize them years later\nAnd you didn't notice until you were working with the police as a as a grown man it wasn't something that you recognize when you were a kid that oh my gosh I've got this strange talent\nNot us to be correct or did not have a clue awful that everybody can do to stop though it was a natural ability for everyone and so I didn't have a clue but the second ... found out what a super recognized off doing the test with those types of Kurdish into the state that all the full ...\nHuh you are as you say took these skills to your police work and let's talk about this case of the Russian spy poisoning I insult very of course you were not involved in this investigation but take us inside that department how would this have played out behind the scenes\nSite firstly I Know the are the guys dealing with it would've been very excited because the whole point is they're going to get lots of ... and ... that's a very exciting thing because that gives us time to review the CCTV would never go look for some people or if not with ... people from the footage\nSo would you use many different techniques like links to attend discussion Web I Would take time for the first each until we noticed his ... scientists and appearing in up state because of a super recognizes were recognized that person that we got some memory than if we see that bus to get another day at the age where stop building to pitch and then we can start seeing is that the person we're looking for\nNow London as you well know is one of the most surveilled cities in the world there's some estimates that there is something like a million CCTV cameras capturing hours and hours of footage every single day of the year how important is that trove of evidence for you is the detective in ... in that unit\nI think is absolutely putting this estimate about one point five million cameras now in London and I think is absolutely marvelous because\nBeing on that said recognize you and I wish I was we used to get so much CCTV comfort to us\nAt pictures of suspects the oath I Would not always looking for the suspect sometimes ... victims were looking for missing persons and having over that say CCTV available if you really help solve ... people well what kind of cases did you crack a very good one was there was a mouse who is one of Scotland Yard much wanted\nAnd he was believed to be out of the country of the time so I was in London and I've seen a ...

but most importantly for cancer patients around the world will tell\nUs a little bit about James Allison's work in immune therapy to attack\nCancer well Dr Alison is really dedicated his entire life and his uh research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works in cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer and\nHis uh maintenance I was to understand how to block of protein on T cells that access to a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that everyday people could understand it 'cause that's you're still probably a doctor level\nSystem the T cells and those T cells are really held in check to ensure that those cells do not attack normal cells in our body or cause auditing immune diseases\nAnd part of that break process also impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Allison really understood\nThe underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer and so what has that meant for cancer treatment in general\n[noise] well this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call him you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery chemotherapy and radiation\nAnd creating entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments or sometimes used in isolation alone\nDo you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer\nAbsolutely I I Do believe that this will lead to insights and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of treatment and allow us to reduce the side effects associate with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer what\nKind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes immunotherapy\nWell we've seen spectacular resolved\nIncluding patients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that gems team\nHas developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond\nThese are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options\nGenes Allison started his career at NBA Anderson in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on\nA the Andy Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had of the moon shots program really giving you a good results\nWell there's a mid shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward and why\nFor research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will die of cancer this year how hopeful argue about the future of cancer treatment right now\nRight now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer treatment we have the combinations of targeted therapy immunotherapy and the use of science as a way to drive discovery as opposed to the historical approaches of screening the environment for compounds that might have anti cancer a fact\nThis change in research strategy coupled with the types of innovations dinner heralded in today's a Nobel Prize awards really open up avenues that create

that being said I'd like it to go quickly\nKavanaugh's nomination is on hold until the FBI investigate allegations of sexual assault against him let's bring in Chad program who covers Congress for Fox News channel it's good to have you back thanks for having me shore so there have been questions about the scope of this investigation did the president tell us anything new about who's in control and what the terms are\nWell he indicated quote I Want to make the Senate happy and uh I've been told here in the past a hour hour and Fifteen minutes or so\nThat by one senior Republican Senate stores that they think they could wrap this up could underscore that by tomorrow but they can't be viewed as rushing this remember the terms of the agreement laid out by Jeff Flake the Republican senator from Arizona on friday was that this was supposed to take a week\nNow let me get a little bit into the weeds here and this is very important and there's a procedure\nMitch McConnell the Senate majority leader has a right to file what's called cloture that's an effort to end debate and whenever he does that consider that to be de won confirmation vote after you run through all the Senate traps would be on about day for maybe day five Mitch McConnell really can't do that until Wednesday at the earliest\nThe question is if he goes ahead before the FBI investigation is complete is he interrupting disagreement with Jeff like Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nOr if they they're okay with that and they're like yes okay this is satisfied it hasn't been a week that's fine let's go ahead\nThen everybody a you know is is cool with it that's fine but if if the he's perceived as jumping the gun\nFrom some conservatives over the weekend or who you know criticized him for saying that you know he was delaying all this they wouldn't have a chance of getting the votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh were not for Jeff Flake they're basically sitting right now about forty nine years\nAnd with this deal they could potentially get Collins potentially get Murkowski maybe Joe Manchin a Democrat from West Virginia maybe Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat from North Dakota maybe get his highest fifty three days but otherwise they're stuck at forty nine so they can't move too quickly in the Senate they have to be there to care for the\nPresident says he wants what Senate leadership wants to the question is what does Senate leadership want I mean who is on that list of people that will be interviewed by the FBI and that's the\nQuestion you know what ... what does Murkowski one that is a big unknown and that's why you know Senate timing around here is not exactly Swiss when they tell you that something is going to happen seven days from now or six days from now usually happens in about eight or nine maybe ten\nI'm the only thing I Do know is that once that clock starts to run ... once McConnell files cloture to end debate that will take that's a finite period about four to five days at the most so\nWe don't know and that's something that they have to have to consider and see where they are and ... did they find out any answer that raised other

of them do one of the grassroots group called the CD all through the campaign for Democratic Republic of this morning cuts um some of the major new toy routines about having a stop to all the traffic like they have managed to break into the train stations ... high speed train running from\nOne of the major cities to fulfill their activities in the new regional president Michael Kim Toyota\nHas said today based activity is working keep pushing it so I think this will be seen as provocative\nCertainly by the main government in Spain and go down things than socialist government to the prime minister ... there is no chance of ever\nA referendum on independence it's against the constitution but they could have greater autonomy and last night I put that to the spokesperson for the cattle and separatist government here and join the PKK he said to me ... and they will continue he said working on accept disobedience\nAnd like be illegal referendum if they don't get an independence choice now he said when and how he said not now I'm telling you will do something\nWell you know we should point out that their recent poll that say that people in the region are split on the issues though there are\nMany people that you've been speaking to still want independence and there are those who do not um how how divided in Catalonia [noise]\nWell I think that's a fascinating thing because it in the in the year since we had a really pivotal moment the polls haven't changed it divided fifty fifty and I think that's the interesting thing when I was also the analysts to look at the situation now\nThey believe the one thing that's increased it is the bitterness between both sides and that is that you nailed it divided front jail sentence it could very easily spark off again on the street [noise] but\nThe BBC's Kevin ... speaking with us from the streets of downtown Barcelona Gavin thanks so much for your time we do appreciate\nMm\n\nWell now that we're into fall and the weather's a little cooler you're in a resident checked Kathy against is here to warm up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy hey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those foods that we love to eat\nIn the studio telling you how simple it is to make various food and I'm not lying but I Will tell you the truth and fried chicken it is involved keep frying at home is completely doable but it's involved well I Would be afraid I Would start a fire started fire but you want to hear my first step yeah\nI use a walk walk the ideal shape for\nHolding the oil knows flattering it's got the high side you want to always work with about an inch to two inches of oil you want to keep a mom and her because you want to constantly be monitoring the temperature of the oil and you put that their own or in the hot oil right so I have my walk\nI also use a cast iron skillet okay I had about an inch to two inches of I like to use a combination of an organic shortening some people use Crisco you can use safflower oil canola oil I like to do a mix\nAnd I bring it up to three twenty five\nAnd because my mom and her is right there I can constantly see why it's getting close to four hundred are oh no no it's down to two hundred and I am always adjusting to tape it around three twenty five three twenty five the highest\nYou want to get his three fifty otherwise you're going to have some burn chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some butter fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken American so I can listen to that crunch alright\nAre good but oh just pick it up for get stuff for it [laughter]\nUm what I did was I took a whole chicken I cut it into eight pieces and I'm marinated it overnight in really good buttermilk salt pepper and the dash of cayenne and buttermilk tender rises chicken it at some of that acidic flavor but it also does tend to rise the chicken\nI take it out and then I dusted well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little affects you see I used to very course\nOf course smell ground corn meal so it's kind of great texture and then I fry it up and here's another track\nOkay to go if you're frying whole chicken you're going to do all the wings at first but then you're going to do the size then you're going to do the recipe says because each one of those cuts cooks for different amount of time and if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there\nYou're not going over or under cook it now you got a little bit of honey hearing some lemon so I didn't do so you would yeah I don't I like it out a lot I like the way the lemon cuts the fatty ness of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey and a sweetness\nWaffles and chicken fried show yeah I'd like to write the hunting isn't The Honeymooners ramps out this sweet flavor there but it's settle down a kind of pulls it out that's a really favorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left of oil after you're done can use that again you can fry\nMore than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it\nBecause I did answer the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end and was a little bit to brown but the idea behind having\nNot greasy\nFood is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying 's\nOkay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this is my version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and why did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go wrong and\nSoy sauce ginger little catch upsetting to me and Scalia and took it out of the marinate dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nAnd then you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really important this is double fried\nFood so you fry it you cool it down and they might try it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy and that's just for Chris ... is it yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra crispy this\nThen I made a sauce out of the marinate I simmered down again the chili paste the ginger\nAnd I spread that on the chicken and ... with sesame seeds and I don't know what do you think it's delicious and and by the way off center well and and I remember we talked to David Chang chef of ... about fried chicken he mentioned there's a lot of history involving fried chicken when it comes to African Americans\nI've also eaten at high schools in Atlanta which is where Martin Luther king used to go and I want is fried chicken\nBack in the day so there's a lot of history and history and David chain did a whole series for Netflix about right did a whole episode on fried chicken and what the big takeaway is that it's eating all over the world but I did talk to Michael ... he is the author of the\nCooking gene which won some James Beard awards he said fried chicken goes back deep into the middle ages in Africa during the slave trade it's emblematic of the afro ... innovation\nThat gets co opted time and time again and he goes on\nAll the influences that make up the fried chicken that we eat in this country that we saw a door okay there's one more thing in front of me Cathy and this is buffalo chicken we eat is buffalo chicken wings of course originally came from buffalo they are traditionally fried\n\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

in Washington state the number of school age children who are homeless is way up the Seattle Times recently found that in several rural and suburban areas the homeless student population had more than doubled between twenty twelve and twenty Seventeen\nAnd ... why the number is up to thirty four percent in the past five years\nAcross the country about one point three million homeless students are enrolled in public schools\nBut why is this happening at a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming\nWell it turns out that may be part of the problem Carly ... is family resource coordinator for Brussels school district in ... county Washington one of the districts trying to figure all this out Carly welcome yeah thank you for having me those numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing there appears county\nWe definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families in the last few years\nTwo years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students [noise] um this year we don't have a total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year do you have any idea why\n[noise] yeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but\nI I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom we never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for\nCrisis that happen um there's many different factors that are leaving these family is just on the edge of becoming homeless and really it's a matter of and\nTacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country or you've seen a an issue where people are getting priced out of a of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community is what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or\nAs cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and like I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happens before things start to crumble underneath them\nAnd it's a symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes yeah [noise] so for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm\nFirst off there are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them um it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go without until we get them recognize\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to school every day\nAnd you notice that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...\nIt's you know I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter] because they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it\nI go out in my community and I do drive ... to go to the address that they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house has like a lotta times I just go out to the house and cold knock on the door they totally don't even expect me but it's just you know they're not responding to me and I just want to\nAsk them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers there ...\nReports out of Idaho they've got the highest number of homeless students that they've seen in years um there's a report out recently about a jumping homeless school kids outside of Anchorage, Alaska this is in many places around the country do you think it's the same root cause\nA each one of these places or something different\nIt's very hard to say I mean each family story is different each demographic is different\nEmployment rates are different but I Would say it has to be directly correlated with um just housing prices going up and we haven't really seen any new shelters or funds being set aside for section eight housing\nTo accommodate the massive boom in these homeless families it's like we're not keeping up with the need so what kind of help where you get it [noise]\nWe um Bethel school district is not connected to a city title so it's very difficult to have the resources and the funds that we need so we require solely on our own community to provide funding and donations\nI Believe that's all we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families because we have system set up where we have a resource bus we drive we'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them closing that they need some times we've even ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need\nAnd we have a food program where we um send food packs home with every homeless students on Fridays so they have food for the weekend until they get back to school on Monday we have multitudes of faith leaders that have pulled together to solve to help solve our problem out here\nAnd it's wonderful and we're well supported that it's it's like a band aid to every crisis it's happening\nAnd it sounds like you're saying it's private citizens step in and it's not it's not the government to do it\nIt's private citizens it's our team baffle it's our hard work and community leaders that we have that have recognized the need and have wanted to help the\nBig picture of course is that this makes it very hard for kids to succeed in school and there's a lot of data out there that the back that up there's one study that says kids who experienced homelessness in school or eighty seven percent more likely\nTo drop out of high school and as you will know then becomes the cycle of poverty you see this every day\nWith the class work [noise] it's just heartbreaking to work with the families and work with the students\nAnd their self worth and their self value and what they believe they are capable of doing is so low that it debilitate stem from doing potentially well and what they potentially could be\nI'll just give you an example I had one young man I was working with and he had no self value could care less about doing his school and I had asked him I said what do you want to do what do you want to be when you grow up and he's like I don't know\nHis probably just end up like my parents and be on the streets and I'm like no you can be you can be something different I said what do you enjoy\nSo after a couple meetings with them over the next week um I had discovered they loved animals so it was simple as hooking him up to a veterinarian it took took the young men under the wings and started showing them the ropes of\nWhat education you need to become a veterinarian doctor and here why don't you come after school and help on tearing clean the kennels for me and do this it gave that boy purpose to have hope in a dream after high school\nAnd that's all I can offer for these students is giving them the hope and the dream that they can be somebody after high school other than what they've experienced\nCurly ... a family resource coordinate with the ... school district in ... county Washington ah which has been dealing with a spike in a number of homeless kids are enrolled in their schools Carly thanks for the work that you do and things were speaking with us yeah thank you for having", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "01"}
