seven auto\nDisappear and now the midterms are three weeks away and pundits and politicians are working hard to make predictions about how they'll turn out we often look for protection tell us what will happen in politics and the economy and technology\nAnd in other things but as the saying goes making predictions is hard especially about the future so how do you do it well joining us now is Dan gardener who's the author of future babble\nIs it that we humans always want to know what's going to happen in the future when it's really hard to do that in a lot of ways\nYeah uh it really stems from a really fundamental need we have a need a psychologically rooted need for control a sense of control of our environment\nAnd what do you need for control of your environment you need to know you need to know what's happening now or if you're looking into the future you need to know what's going to happen and if you look into the future\nAnd you've got important questions on your mind and all you see as a swirling vortex of uncertainty that's deeply disturbing you have to a race that uncertain and one way that we erased uncertainty is by turning to experts in saying please tell me what's going to happen next\nOne experts that I think of when it comes to protection that get it pretty right at least in the not too distant future weather forecasters yeah I have an app that tells me in ten minutes it's going to start raining exactly where you are right now um but you know where are we good at it and where would that it it\nWell it's interesting that you highlight weather forecasters because of course people tend to make jokes about weather forecast that they always get things wrong yeah ... exactly the opposite in fact weather forecasting is the gold standard of forecasting\nNow the big difference between the weather forecasters in one of the reasons why they're so good and so many other demeans [noise]\nIs it the weather forecasters know how good they are and they know when they cannot do so many other demeans that's not true people use vague language like something's probably going to happen or that's pretty certain or there's a good chance that\nA and nobody keeps track they don't keep score and so if you look at the big famous pundits who tend to dominate the news whether it's politics or economics or anything else [noise]\nUm they don't actually have proven track record scientifically scored track records we don't know how accurate they are in the same way that we know how good a baseball player is by looking at his batting average\nIs the goal of a forecast to change the future to be able to make a decision once you know what's gonna happen and once you think you know what's gonna happen that will change the outcome\nVisited the absolutely essential point very often when you talked about forecasting people talk about well how do you make it accurate forecast blood very very often when forecasts are made it's not actually accuracy the people are interested in there all sorts of other reason\nIdeologically congenial for the audience that very often happens or they might be making a forecast because it's shocking and it's interesting it entertaining [noise]\nAh there's all sorts of these other competing interests and one of those is to cause change so for example if I warned that some terrible thing is about to happen it's not necessarily that I Believe that is in fact the case\nIt may be that I'm trying to spur others to action in order to prevent this suppose a catastrophe [noise]\nUm so we have to be careful when we're looking at a forecast we have to ask yourself is this person just trying to get me district good to be as accurate as possible or do they have other interests at stake\nWhat are some big flops some production failures that stand out in your memory\nWell I always liked to say that the Nineteen seventies where the golden era of failed predictions um it started really in Nineteen sixty eight with population bomb by Paul Ehrlich there was a huge bestseller basically said that there will be mask global starvation within a couple of decades [noise]\nWrong uh and then the Nineteen seventies were absolutely stuffed with the most amazing forecasts and and happily for humanity most of those forecasts which were wrong we're all dismal they all said we're going to run out of oil [noise] um\nWell it reminds me of Y. two K. right that we all thought that general there's going to end with two thousand came along and nothing happened\nThat's that's exactly right Y. two K. was another one there is a very long litany of these things but you know a one of the unfortunate aspects about forecasting is this\nIf I go back to old forecasts and say hey do you remember what that guy said ten years ago well let's take a look at what happened and it turns out it's wrong\nI can tell you from experience the people kinda yawn [laughter] because it's an old forecast who cares about or forecast old forecasts are old news but if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be right\nThen they will be introduced as a person who got it right and we all have to listen to this person because they tell us what's gonna happen next and as a result the rule with expert predictions so often it heads I win tails you forget we had a bad\nRight well you think about that every time somebody who figured out the President Trump was gonna win when much of the media thought that he would not when a when he did win you know there are a few journalists out there like I said at look at my tweet from you know I thought it was going to happen [laughter]\nAnd you just bet on all sorts of different stocks and ... by sheer happenstance one or two of them will hit big and then you hold up your one or two that hit big and you say look at this what a brilliant invest right and well forecast very often function like that you can't judge the quality of a forecaster by a single forecast\nThat stand gardener who is author of the book future babble and co author of super forecasting the art and science fiction Dan thank you so much for joining us thank you well let us know what you think of forecast political and otherwise here and now dot org\nThe famous Santa Ana winds blew into Southern California today prompting the national weather service to issue a red alert for fire danger\nIn

Saudi Arabia this was broke killers\nBut in a constantly you know even Republican lawmakers want punishment that the president seems unwilling to carry out in blocking an arms deal when what do you what's your sense of what's going to happen here well\nIt certainly complicated geopolitically for this president he seems to have revealed himself pretty plainly as somebody who wants to talk about you know specific transactions are very transactional person this is the way he was with his real estate deals and the thing that kept coming up for President Trump was the fact last night on sixty minutes that\nHe said look they we get billions of dollars in a you know these weapons sales and he doesn't want to hurt jobs when it comes to re piano or any of the other uh arms makers\nWell and and as others have said these aren't really commitments for sales are more like promissory notes you know they they may not happen anyway but and some of them also did happen under the Obama administration but you mentioned the sixty minutes interview he was also asked about that\nAnd time is running out to do something about it the president said he's not denying that climate change
