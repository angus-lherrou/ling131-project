of a legal battle the Trump Administration wants to include a question about whether the resident answering the center is a U.S citizen opponent said that's unconstitutional and he was commerce secretary Wilbur Ross to answer questions about it on heroes\nInternal documents show that secretary rock pushed for the question even though he told Congress that the Justice Department had asked for it the White House wants to stop Iran from having to tell\nThis story he joins us now handy I like to you have I Know rents thousands of government documents about this what did you learn from them about how the citizenship question came up out in the first place\n[noise] all these documents were part relief in part as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question and it really he documented an internal memo written by Congress secretary Wilbur Ross who advocate our secretary oversees the Census Bureau and the twenty twenty senses and ... he says\nThat eat initially thought about adding a citizenship question to the twenty twenty scented as soon as\nShortly after he became ... the Senate confirms him as the commerce secretary so this would be late February of twenty Seventeen and then a over those months he worked with his staff at the commerce secretary to find a way to get this question a citizenship question on to the dentist and this is a question that asks\nIs this person a citizen of the United states\nIt's a topic that the Census Bureau has not asked all us households since the Nineteen fifty cents is although there have been a there's been a citizenship question on a smaller group survey that's now known as the American Community Survey\nWhat reason then does the administration gave her why it doesn't want accurate jury wrong to testify about it at least one thing about his dreams\n[noise] well the Justice Department or which is representing a commerce secretary Wilbur Ross and the Trump Administration these lawsuits their attorneys are saying that the judges should\nDecide these lawsuits based on the documents these internal documents that they're released as part of the lawsuits\nAnd not on depositions questioning of Wilbur Ross ah and trying to get into his intend to mind that but that's exactly what the plaintiffs in these lawsuits you know dozens of states cities and other groups that want this question removed\nThey say they really want to do a better understand exactly why commerce secretary Wilbur Ross went to add this question because the Trump Administration has said\nThey wanted to add to because of the voting rights act and they wanted responses from a citizenship question to better enforced section to the voting rights act which has protections against discrimination of racial\nAnd language minorities are especially to make sure those groups have the right to vote 'em that the ... the federal government has relied on other another kind of citizenship data from the American Community Survey of 'em and uh the ... and said that data is not enough\nSkeptical of that and they're concerned that there are other other motives you're involved or one of the internal memos or one of the emails released as part of the lawsuits include a communication between a Kris Kobach the current Republican gubernatorial candidate as well as the former vice chair of President Trump's now defunct\nCommission on voter fraud you wrote to Wilbur Ross are trying to lobby Wilbur Ross to addict citizenship question and his concern was that undocumented unauthorized immigrants are counted in census numbers used to divide up\nThe congressional seats are among the states after the census\n[noise] uh all of this comes at a really pivotal time for the bureau itself or the Senate has not yet confirmed President Trump's new appointee to lead the agency\nOr the Twenty one twenty cents as it's going to be the first to be conducted in part on line with all of that going on how prepared is the bureau for what they massive undertaking\nOh they are the Census Bureau has really anxious to find out exactly will the citizenship question that Wilbur Ross adorable it's day or will it go and where you probably won't find out until a few months\nAnd that's really pushing up against a deadline that the Census Bureau spacing of what exactly prints on the forms are this will be the first online census like paper will play an important part for live households that may not be comfortable I don't have access to the Internet and so they will be paper\nAnd so this is a really big question right now and that hopefully the lawsuits will resolve a from the Census Bureau perspective now the big question will they be able to hire enough workers to collective uh information from households around

has a big theory that he was in the written out when the painting the shredded\nWell so let's talk about some of the theories that what you know 'cause there are people who who think they've seen him at work doing one of the installation going to wall somewhere or in but you know we don't know who you're so um what are some of the theories about about who this with this mysterious artist might be\n[noise] stay have ranged from him being a painter and decorate teen another graffiti artist named king robots\nAnd people say he Damien her people even said that you know banks he may well be a

I think not what he did he want his message and he won't have to walk to be for everybody rather than ... take ownership is at\nOther theories like hot or he wants his wife to have a great\nNumber of things and and my passionate opinion is that he just doesn't want anyone to in his message\nNow one of the questions people are asking is how do you hide a shredder inside a picture frame without anybody noticed that nobody in the auction house was enormous\n... and because he has ... in Japan shame how he went about building to frame himself and installing a shredder inside and I think as he was the passing on that and\nIt could it could very well it's been someone from inside the base in on it and that may be a friend who may be another another graffiti artist he maybe with lacking that but I ...

kind of a bully he finds one of the letters takes it home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your editor Hanson and so he's they think their best friends and for Evan Hansing kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control and also kind of changes him Steven Livingston\nThis idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything you've always wanted comes true but it's also about the people around him are killed by the story as well I um she feels as though he's giving something to that\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace just you know best friend of their son who of course is and I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear having mother a struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because he can't keep them a lot of things that they\nGet some way [noise] [noise]\n\nThat's how you were able to put those feelings into what's on what's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music to get across these characters\nKnow it's true that we talked about at the beginning of the process without which was\nYou know how do you take the would become sort of temple moments when the musical how do you take that in translated into a book it is an interesting process of how do you get inside the character's head in the same way to the song does and that's why I think it does work so well as a novel because the book allows us\nWell and uh and same token we also felt like we wanted this to be a different experience from the musical and so we weren't slaves ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow any uh ... this is very special to people all these characters in especially ... really means something to young people then you can your hand\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel [laughter] yes lots of sweaty hand still sort of hands in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In evidence first monologue and the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say and they also had plenty hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being sweaty they're becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before I felt like I knew how to do this emotion I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity\nAnd the intensity with with which people had attached themselves to heaven and the other characters\nNot talking about this notion that you're writing about suicide you Erica I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize that's\nFor sure um suicide it's something um that I have a ... with let's just say I know um was the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nThat we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of theirs and and the mission they gave me tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just a small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it is a him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experience joy I'm or was it all\nYou know I'm darkness we don't want to get anything away but I have to say we actually find out ... and we find out if a crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nYou know this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a a\nOne thing to know more about Connor but do you really want to know more about counter or do you want to imagine\nMore about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it is that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does\nAnd it was important to us but it's not feel mano causal I'm like there's this one thing that ... that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feels like a cautionary tale for kind of what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media Evan and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know\nWhat can happen when suddenly or you don't even know what you're you know doing it and you're on a national stage there's that\nBut a bench perfect and I just didn't ... I understand that why you did they did what to do how much to do more in a book and you did in the musical your fans we're already doing it than fiction they were they were writing about Evan and Conor what might happen\nYeah this is Justin you know that that was done something that was inspiring to us in terms of doing an adaptation was seeing that there were a fans around the country around the world who had never seen the show maybe they had listened to the cast album are red watched a clip on line or something and\nThey were beginning to create their own stories with these characters and interactions that might have been between evident Connor and and I'm a particular curiosity about Connor which is you know partially what inspired us people wanting to engage with these characters and that's what gave us the confidence to do this from the first place\nIt is a conversation starter for families you know moms can see elements of their kids that their kids won't talk about you know out loud and and and kids will see elements of their parents said that humanize them and ultimately it's really about\nWe relate to our family members how we hide ugly truth about ourselves\nFunding

eighty four thousand men women and children mostly from Syria Iraq into Africa\nHave arrived in Spain Italy and Greece this year every day more than one hundred people arrive on the Greek island of Lesbos the first faces they see are those of humanitarian aid workers to help them reach the shore clothing and\nFor months and that takes a toll they have high levels of depression exhaustion and even pi TST that can last for years now the George Washington university global mental health program as drawn up a version of the Hippocratic Oath\nTo address the problem the age it originated increase it calls for physicians to swear to abide by ethical standards Phillip ... is one of the doctors behind this new version\nIt's still the general principles of caring for patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits keeping confidences but continue to this day\nCan't deal with his professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nThe way we turned to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we will do you go to the people take care of their team and take care of themselves recognizing that there's a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first they have to take care of their teams\nThey have to make sure that they stay within their areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story of when she was working in Africa and as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a severe infection on a pregnant for refugees so that the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult and desperate\nAs you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath you're able to give her permission to have a cat\nRight that's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work\nI don't think that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there it's a it's a great point uh our hope\nIs that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that were going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\nOne of the things that you and your colleagues have noted is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees and they are\nTennis quite community how could that caused problems and how are you dealing with that\nWe've been impressed that the people who work with the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more Western European generate that they show when they're working with folks from North Africa I'm a Middle East\nSo we learned that many of them had grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange of populations in the Nineteen twenties\nIn the ah follows me or not they were refugees from Asia Minor\nEveryone seems to have an immigrant story they had married someone from outside Greece these workers you talking about that's right that's right so there was a sense that we're all immigrants in one sense and therefore this kind of work takes on a shared a humanitarian motivation\nJust one more question um I have no need for quite some time and I know you are as you said Greek American and you go to Greece quite often because of the refugee crisis\nBut I Wonder what it was like for you to be in one of the cradle of modern medicine implementing a very different kind of hypocritical for a very different reason from what the original one was drawn up for me personally what is it like for you\nIt's an opportunity to take the expertise that I've learned here in the states and take it back to the origins of you know my family's migration\nIn the Nineteen fifties so my family left Greece after er during the civil unrest there after World War two and to be able to go back\nAnd offer what our cat we were just there in September [noise] talking to folks and so on and go and ask them about the work that we do and a recruiting help from the Greek psychiatric community so being able to collaborate in this way it's been both professionally I'm personally fulfilling\nPhilippine Dallas thank you thank you Lisa\nThat's Dr Phil ... who is part of the George Washington global mental health program that's drawn up the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian aid workers back to the U.S now and a story from the American west walk through forests that region and you're likely to see centuries\nUNC Israel and ... report archaeologist don't know why ancient tribes peeled some of the bark away and they're running out of time to solve the mystery Cassandra ten cents for tribes like the southern you southwest Colorado these ponderosa pines are housed important as cliff dwellings or picked a graph\n'cause we're we're a little over a nomadic and we weren't like pillows and are are now all of these trees show that we were here\nAttention was a cultural representative for the southern Indian tribe these special ponderosa pines are scattered across the Rocky Mountain region and they all have something in common a big chunk of bark missing from one side peeled away by people sometime in the last few hundred years\nThis Israel\nAt places a footprint on the landscape as people as a child\nThere are a bunch of them here on the edge of a meadow south\nOf the San Juan mountains harmed in her right there [laughter]\nArchaeologist mark Mitchell walks up to in our old tree about as wide across as to people it's thick red bark is curling into reclaiming exposed area that looks a lot like a

precisely was the purpose of the floor window it's edible\nBut he says where people eating it because it was a delicacy or because they were starving with medicine or part of a special occasion Julie Coleman wonders if these trees might reveal patterns about how tribes like the you were moving across the landscape she's an archaeologist with the San Juan national for it [noise]\nAs a GPS unit get quite pots and each tree and then hopefully we'll see a pattern and you might show trails in you know all the ways that mark Mitchell\nTicket for a while but we really feel the urgency of now drought could kill these trees or in expanding beetle infestation could crippled them with the fungus called blue stain or wildfires could erase them\nSome of the big fires that we've had in Colorado in the last five or six years have taken some of the streets when that\nTime could also get them some of these trees could be five hundred years old like this one\nOh wow that is cool [noise]\nThat doesn't mean that is amazing I was hoping we will try it out of this\nFor this treat people didn't just scrape off the edible part the also pried off six planks of would presumably to build something like a traditional cradle board to carry a baby and that's what it reminded Cassandra attempt\nDeal out of seeing it brought her to tears [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city":
