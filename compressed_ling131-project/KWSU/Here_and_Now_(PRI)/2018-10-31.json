rather than young I'm Jeremy hops and it's here and now it is Halloween it's also six days before the election President Trump hits the campaign trail again today\nOpen your talk immigration after visiting Pittsburgh yesterday to pay respects after the synagogue shooting Democrats across the country are making their final pitch to voters many focusing their message on healthcare\nWe're joined now by NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson high ... high there so you were about to join President Trump in in his campaign pushy is heading to Florida one of the things people have noticed about his schedule a leading up to the midterms at this point is that he seems to be focused\nMainly on Senate races as he given up on Republicans keeping the house\n[noise] I don't think he's given up I think Republicans are engaged in the mad scramble to keep their losses in the house as low as possible but the president has been going to red states states where he's popular he doesn't he isn't campaigning in blue\nDistricts where he's not popular and it just so happens that this year the Senate battleground is a bunch of very red states that he won where his approval rating is very high and they're just happens to be Democratic Senate incumbents are running for re election in those states so that's where he's focusing\nAnd meanwhile he's been talking as as we've been talking about the last twenty four hours or so about ending so called birthright citizenship he said today on Twitter that it will be ended one way or the other even though\nIt is protected by the constitution and constitutional scholars have said it would not be possible for him to ended by executive order we remember that it was a week ago Marta that he was talking about passing a middle class tax cut before the election do these last minute policy appeals work for voters\nHe thinks they worked for his base don't forget immigration is the number one issue is the number one culture war issues that he thinks energizing his his voters\nThat's what birthright citizenship is for he also is ending fifty two hundred troops to the border even though that caravan is mostly filled with women and kids and it's hundreds of miles away from the U.S border\nBut the ... ten percent tax cut 'em gambit is defensive\nAnd middle class people and the Republicans own internal polls show that people think it was a tax cut for the rich and not for them\nSo he was appealing to his base but can Republicans do what they want to do in these midterms just with the base\n[noise] well that's what the president's theory as it's always all about the base with him and the problem for a lot of Republicans in these affluent educated suburban districts is\nThey need more than the base they need independent voters and they've been struggling a members of Congress in those districts have been struggling [noise] what\nAbout the other big story of this week which is of course the the terrible I'm shooting in Pittsburgh end of following up on the pipe bombs that were sent to some of the predator the president's critics\nI he's been blaming the media for climate of violence creating a climate of violence on many had been blaming him and his rhetoric what voters thinking as you look at all that\nWell what we have seen is over the last week or two his approval rating has dipped\nAnd we saw this before or after Charlottesville when he said ... they were good people on both sides um neo Nazis and the counter protesters and the when the president tries to deal with a national tragedy like this\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners off WVU are Boston and Geico offering auto insurance coverage for cars trucks are refugees and providing twenty four seven customer service more information on auto insurance at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto\nThis is here and now it's a quirk of Florida politics every Twenty years around three dozen people gather together to come up with amendments to the state constitution Florida is the only state that has this kind of commission which bundled together a number of issues into one yes or no question Danny Rivero of W ELL around explains\nIf you live in Florida on election day you'll get the option to ban offshore drilling and also been vaping in the workplace or you can vote to change the state college system and also give more deaths benefits to the families of first responders and members of the military [noise]\nThese two items on the November ballot or the product of the Florida Constitution revision commission\nAnd the voter has to make a terrible choice\nEllen freedom was on the ... commission Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight\nDo I vote for the thing I don't like in order to get the thing I Do like and that's just not fair\nAnd not acceptable I think that what the constitution revision commission did isn't packed things that they thought would be popular along with things that they really wanted but so I wouldn't be popular\nThat's all Broward County top administrator Bertha Henry sees a to particularly on a question that would do three things at once mandate a State Department of veteran affairs mandate is the anti terrorism office and something Henry's not happy with force every county to have five elected government officials including sheriff in supervisor of elections\nAmendment that's on the agenda is sandwiched in between motherhood and apple pie\nBut the way freedom and some legal experts to get this time is different [noise] Twenty years ago the decision about who would be on the commission came from a mix of Democrats and Republicans that men in almost even split between the two parties says I'll end Frieden\nAnything that got passed through that constitution revision commission had to be seriously debated compromises had to be made and it had to be something that was agreeable on a bipartisan level\nBut this year every appointment was made by Republicans are Republican appointed officials and that can make things look political even if they're not Emory gamut as was on this year's commission on a committee that helped write the language voters will see she says politics were not at play just plain logic so when we\nFirst started meeting we all came to the table with ideas of how things might be grouped and everything really had in a somewhat of an actress or natural connection\nGame is offers the example of amendment nine which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work but if you look\nAt it from a let's make our environment more friendly and and and protect our state and protect our citizens I think they need some kind of see why they would have fit together I Can't say that personally I agreed with all of the group themes and my voting record would speak to that\nBut for the most part I did and I thought that we put things together in a way that it made sense\n... says there's another reason for grouping amendments in some places ballots are nearly twenty pages long this year so the commission wanted to stop voter fatigue to meet the shorter an easier for people\nThere's just one rule the commission has to follow according to the floor of the constitution the title and the summary of the amendment need to be clearly understood by voters Timothy McClintock is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Florida\nThat he needs to clearly state chief purpose it needs to be comprehensible I saw the more you windfall of different disparate subject that can really be a challenge there\nThe Florida Supreme Court already ruled that one bundled amendment was not clear enough for voters there was about charter schools and it didn't use the phrase charter schools so that was removed from the ballot\nThree other amendments were in jeopardy of being tossed off the ballot until this month when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they would stay justice Barbara party in the road the questions were improperly bundled and they didn't give voters a clear choice of what they're voting on\nBut the legal filing that was used to make that argument was the improper vehicle [noise] just\nFor here and now I'm Danny Rivero in Miami\nWhether you're a voter in Florida or another state you may also have ballot measures to weigh in on on election day this year there are a hundred and fifty five statewide ballot measures in thirty seven states sixty four of them are citizen led initiatives\nThere an example of direct democracy letting voters rather than legislatures decide policies and laws joining us now is Josh all tick who's the project director for the ballot measures project at ballot PDF Josh welcome yeah it's good to be here thank you and how does the number of statewide ballot initiatives this year compared to other years\nOverall the total number a statewide measure it has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty sixteen and twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgent specifically in citizen initiated measures measures they get on the ballot through a senior trip protection signed by registered voters and in\nThose citizen initiated ballot measures if they get past do they become law or is it something that than just gets refer to the legislature to make a decision about\nThose have gone to the ballot for a final approval from the voters on there a couple of exceptions for example in Nevada there is a measure that has to get approved again and twenty twenty if it passes and twenty Eighteen um but these measures are going to the voters and the voters have the last day on them [laughter] so what\nKind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do with elections and voting\nYeah that's one of the the biggest trends are seeing in twenty Eighteen or things like redistricting systems are adding commissions are changing the requirements for redistricting\nMarijuana is another topic that's been on the ballot a lot you know in recent years it's been a trend and it sort of continuing this year\n... other election policies related measures things like voting requirements voter id campaign finance an ethics is another big issue in North Dakota South Dakota Missouri how difficult is it to get some of these initiatives onto the ballot\nThat process varies by state the number of signatures required is usually based on a percentage of voter turnout either for the president for um the governor for me to secretary of state and the total number varies from ... a little over Thirteen thousand in a small state like North Dakota to over half a million in California this year\nThe costs on average was a million dollars a little over a million dollars and twenty Eighteen finished\nSo does that mean that it is mostly big organizations who get behind these things and get them on the ballot or could have just be Jane Q voter\nThere are a few sort of really true grassroots volunteer efforts but for the most part if these things are crossing over a million dollars\nIt's behind you to provide the funding to get these on the ballot\nI can imagine that in some cases state legislators would be happy that something is put to the voters so they don't have to make the call themselves and in other cases they might not be happy because it ties their hands\nYet in general implicit in the initiative process is a conflict between citizens or are registered voters and the legislature the the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as\nA sort of a method of last resort if they're not getting what they want done in the legislature and they see an opportunity that voters might approve a policy that the legislature has either not acted on or has opposed um but there's always some exceptions that proves that rule and there are cases where\nPolitically connected people go to the initiative process and that could be for for a variety of reasons but for the most part the citizen initiative process used when the policies are being approved in the legislature\nNow sometimes the voters decide on something and then the state uh either dragged its feet or decide that doesn't want to go through with it or in Maine last year sixty percent of voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more people but the governor there ... page has blocked implementation\nAnd there's an ongoing legal battle over it or how often does that kind of thing happen\nAs you see the initiative process habits resurgent soon as you see more initiatives you see the number of instances where that conflict I was talking about implicit boils to the surface\nThe response to the twenty sixty initiatives was in many cases to either repeal or um changed the initiatives if possible and some states allow that some don't or to pass restrictions on the process\nAnd then the sort of a third response we've seen is an effort to compromise and twenty Eighteen with an issue proponents instead of letting him go to the ballot and letting it be to sort of hard battle trying to find some sort of deal they can make where initial problems withdraw and the policies do gets at least some sort of advancement if it's not the full effort that the addition opponents want it\nWhat is the thought about how useful a ballot questions are\nDirect democracy is is really important in the U. S. um every state but Delaware for forty nine states\nRequire voters to ratify constitutional amendments to even if the legislature puts it on the ballot the voters still have to vote on it the question really comes down to end the argument is about citizen initiated measures where\nYou know in industry or a corporation or out of the interest or grassroots volunteer efforts can put a measure on the ballot by collecting a certain number of signatures\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of WB you are Boston and your NPR station\nFrom constant contact who segmentation

it's not about the results are investigations into Russian interference in their twenties sixteen elections or possible collusion with the Trump campaign\nIt's about allocation mothers often has referred to the FBI that winning offering money to make fun of sexual misconduct claims about him\nNPR national security editor Phil Ewing joins us now feel this is weird though what do we know they'll find out the story\nIt's a very weird story it if it's a hoax that appears to be a hoax within a hoax so are there were these allegations that came into in boxes in Washington of reporters including NPR\nFrom someone who called herself a woman in Florida who had allegedly been offered money to make these false charges against Muller and what may be the cases that woman actually\nDoes not exist and that those false charges were in fact false charges about false charges what isn't clear is whether this was intended to embarrass the special counsel's office or just to embarrass the journalists who had been sent this email as they tried to investigate in report on it\nOr or is it possible that these women 'cause I Want to be clear this woman was trying to learn um did they needed to that she was trying to alert Miller's office that someone was trying to take him down\nWe're not aware of any contact but between the women involved here in the special counsel's office that it's all been done through journalist intermediaries and they've reached out to the special counsel's office to ask about this and when it became aware of those uh outreach attempts then that's what it refers to the FBI\nAnd well there are two conservative media personalities Jacob all and jak Berkman who I had to be linked to the story to tell us about that\nThat's right wall is the young man who writes for the website gateway pundit Berkman has a show on Newsmax TV which is owned by President Trump's friend and supporter Chris Ruddy and what they've said is the special counsel investigation is itself a hoax that it's illegal and that it's unfounded\nAnd they want to expose what they call the crimes or the finality involving the special counsel's office and Miller himself and that is the background for these\nAccusations or a legit accusations this week involving a period of misconduct by Mahler um they appeared in these emails to news organizations and also on gateway pundit yesterday Tuesday in the form of a so called intelligent ... intelligence report\nThat was linked to a so called ah intelligence agency which in its way was kind of a parody of the Steele dossier a which by the way is partly unverified\nThis on line that this alleged intelligence agency was made up of a series of suspicious linked in pages and the profile pictures of the people who have those pages where people like actors or models not real human being\nOkay well now my head is officially exploded and we have about less than a minute left so our ... is the speculation that these conservative personalities might have been behind paying these women just say something about Muller I mean what what what is the possibility here\nThere may never have been any women at all and those are payments are those accusations were themselves just a trap\nTo try to get reporters to talk about them or none of that is clear however we do know the special counsel's office has has asked the FBI to get to the bottom of this and if it doesn't there are criminal charges or there are some kind of report from the FBI we may learn what the real story was that was taking place\n... in other words if somebody was masking a masquerading as a woman saying that there was sexual misconduct allegations about Miller and she was with the money and exact and someone had made that up\nThey would be in trouble NPR national security editor Phil Ewing in Washington we will follow this thank you thank you well know email earlier this month a federal judge in California block the Trump administration's plan to end the temporary protected status TPS for immigrants from Sudan El Salvador Haiti in Nicaragua\nThat ruling men that an estimated three hundred thousand immigrants didn't have to have\nAn immediate threat of deportation but many of them had lives are already turned upside down during the ... plus months when they believe they'd have to leave the United states he\nWhy didn't lobby is one example of that she's a TPS holder from Sudan it day recently war torn country but she left for other reasons of fears of her personal safety and until a few weeks ago\nWas prepared to lose her temporary protected status on November second which had been the deadline\nShe joined us in the studio welcome thank you for having me and how long have you lived in the U.S under this\nTemporary protected status have been here since Nineteen Ninety seven so it's twenty twenty Twenty one years I'm I'm not going to ask at age but it feels as if that would be a good deal of your life yes that's a big chunk of my life and you haven't returned to then during the time now\nSo I Know you can't talk about why you came here because you have an asylum case that is correct\nWhat kind of life had you created here in the United states uh United States has been very kind to me [noise]\nI yeah I was able to finish my dissertation I have a master's degree\nAs a healthy Decatur for Eighteen years and right now I work with western governors university an online school that is based in you that right now I'm working with him as an e cat called getting it yeah so we provide I got to make a technical help on line for the student as\nWell and we should note the since it's a sensitive subject for TPS holders did the government didn't pay for your education you pay for that yourself\nSo having crafted that life you know find yourself in broiled in an asylum case whether or not you can receive asylum in this country and you were under the threat of deportation what did you think when you heard that your status would be ended\nAnd lost terrifying [laughter]\nShe likes that are finding it ah it it's um [noise] I have been here for twenty Twenty years and when you live in a place for a loan it becomes home you've been alive theories gets that I don't have kids but I Know so many of ticket holders who are raising up gets here a\nCommunity here he is a big companies

prepare for having perhaps to leave by the end of this week that you shut things down I mean what did you do thinking you might have to leave [noise] that's true because um\n[noise] I used to on a ...

wouldn't need to do which is I had a I sold my backyard\nAnd so on because I wasn't sure if it even able to be here demanded center so [noise]\nUm I was terrified that I'm going to also lose my job right now uh with university because um which is a deadline everything stops so driver's license wire got everything that I could have stopped with a constellation of ... as it was a roller coaster and it was really terrified\nSo you've already sold your business you say is your dream and then you were looking ahead and thinking boy on November second I Would lose as you said my license everything that enables me to function and possibly your other job which is working with this on line university here so that had to be a a a frightening\nStatus for Sudanese immigrants like yourself is that Sudan is no longer a dangerous place to live according to them the less civil war is over you say\nIt's even old am I might be over in the headlines but the situation in the ground is not that is not that great\nAnd again you were here throughout a time where you could not have gone back at all um legal up until this change in American policy\nOr you were part of the lawsuits that resulted in the Trump administration's decision being blocked he took this before that judge that overturn that November second date but they're going to be another date are you still living in fear that you know any day now this could happen\nBecause uh just decision it's a ... and do a judge decide on a case and um she did not find a solution\nTo our status that's why we're hoping that Congress would

was a fact or wasn't and facts were sacred\nSoon single produce Ninety pages of inaccuracies which the two turned into a book with email exchange just like the following one read by our colleagues single questions John and the time John said it took for the poor young jumper to hit the ground John to God has said it was nine seconds but the Carter said it was eighth\nYeah a budget that doesn't seem like it should be a big deal though it's only a second and I needed them in the fall for nine seconds rather than eight in order to help make some of the leader seems any yesterday work\nJohn changing details about stuff like Tabasco sauce bottles and thermometers is one thing but it seems a tad unethical to fiddle with details that really directly to the kids' death\nI don't think it's unethical particularly because I wasn't alone in assuming his fault took nine seconds for a while as parents also was saying that he had fallen for nine seconds\nBut now you do no better so should change\nNine is to integral part of the yesterday at this point and I admit that I'm wrong about nine later on anyway so the answer is not changing it would ruin the say it would ruin it to make it more accurate yep\nWell now those emails have been turned into the Broadway play lifespan of a fact\nWith powerhouse actors body kind of al as writer John D'Agata Harry Potter I mean Daniel rag plus\nAs fact checker Jim single and cherry Jones as an editor referencing the to the seven years of fact finding has been condensed into twenty four hours in which the three are trapped in an apartment like caged cougars battling sometimes physically\nOver the meaning of fact as a deadline looms which side will win will editor cherry Jones publish it you know find out [noise]\nWe met up backstage with all three before recent matinee\nAs veterans on the stage can you feel what we felt in the audience last night people on the edge of their seat it's like I I don't want to try to outdo the critics here was describing this but I came up with a pistol Larry ... you know I think you\nKnow it feels like we're at almost a fight or a a a debate yeah first of all I have to have\nTo for the first time ... wholesome and yeah I mean I I've never done a play before but I have an argument at the center of it to feel that going backwards and forwards every night is reading your special unlike some nights\nI'll feel the audience finding me particularly irritating at a certain moment of gyms quibble with like make the audience go oh discussing ridiculous but actually like the ... in in in my head they all know or digested told I find like five you up to go okay I have to I have to try and win this even more\nDo you feel that because that that during the guy behind me last night I don't know if you guys could hear that he kept going yeah we did when when you would make a point did did you feel that\nSometimes we do like any good player you know the events of the players\nTo be the biggest events of the characters on stages lives in a sense and I think it works best when the three of us are fighting for it with all our lives\nThe cherry explain your character because the character isn't in the book but there is an editor\nWell it's funny because Jim single agenda God who we've been seeing a lot of 'cause they've come to the show many times in fact last night when I said the first line of the play is Okay Jim single\nI heard people actually laughed and it was when I left the theater last night Jim single was standing there with thirty literally thirty of his relatives who've flown in from\nAll over the country and and I when I opened the book that which they kind of gave for opening night Jim's comment was man we could use to\nUse your character as this sort of what the soul of the argument\nI don't know if it's this she's a solar the argument but she's the one who has to make the decision and she's so desperately wants to publish it because she really thinks it will help at this moment in time\nBut it's the same time she is at a journalist and Dana gamut [laughter] every night as it comes down to the moment just to play where a decision has to be made you and your character have not made up their mind until the moment I reach for the phone how it's who convinces me\nOther is often you if you publish Eleanor every night and now the head guy that's got to be called up how strong the money [laughter]\nSingle wrote in my book thanks for having John's back\nOh I can talk about that when your character John to God I was saying things like yeah there are thirty one strip clubs ... thirty four is a better number so I like that number my head was explode\nAnd a piece of writing in the newspaper is really different to me the fact in fact oh my God we're having a play oh yeah\nThere is a difference in an ... an artistic peace being written in advance you know what would you say about the Greek history is what would you say about in cold blood\nI Would say Daniel you're smiling Daniels character gym would say if it's thirty one strip clubs you can't make it thirty for it because you like the way that number's sounds you've obviously it's not your character is not a bad guy where in real life I call\nThem back I anyway he's just he's a writer Rican art\nBut in your life he he has said that the real writer and said oh my God I'm like the devil spawn or something\nThat people just destroyed them and they continue to do so um I don't think it's fair chunk does it work for the Washington Post who's not writing articles where you're writing articles for\nNew York times he's he's a little bit later in the lives of people who normally would never be written about just falls in a long line of traditions why all of a sudden because we're in such a controversial time we're going to just say all these artists you can't do that anymore\nBut that brings us to present day and you're all aware that there's a moment in the play where your character John ... had a line in most of the lines are straight out of the real life\nInteractions and there's a whole world the facts to choose from the wrong stocks get in a way of the story and your test us as their own facts what does that mean exactly\nYou got to be aware that we have a presidential health person Kellyanne Conway is focused alternative ...\nInteresting because there is a beautiful speech about the importance of facts and democracy and\nFrequently gets upon the argument is basically that if you were reading something or watching something and you find even one thing to be untrue in at the whole thing can afford a policy you and your trust in your relationship without saying\nYou know there's one point in the play where it would debate about the length of time that person's cell for not one of those moments that the audience is kind of going like oh come on clearly you all guys the father said no to different the math and you got to gym\nOnce to publish this essay he is convinced that by making it true or you will also make it more beautiful inherently\nYeah but it is irritating certain play give single start to feel like one headline said a little bit crazy\nI think Jim planning and the play is that he can't differentiate between the things that are ready to eat like you know that's the case of a ticking you'll battles and he becomes more and more entrenched as the argument between him and John gets more intense\nYou'd do both for calm the divided United States in a way\nTo say the Kelly on the stage I mean they're they're heat up there\nThere is and in fact I left a little more heat happening last night I was slow on an interim so that's the other day was strangling each Oh yes yes\nI'm already know winning that fight [laughter] bother us strongly Daniel okay yeah\nIt does go to those extremes because these two men cares so much in it is in that sense where we are as a nation right now of of what facts mean to I hate to say the either side and I just can't believe we're talking about our country that way but\nThen you'll you'll actually get a taste of that she went to the New Yorker and you were a fact checker for a day it's purely hands shaking on your red and when you made a call\nYou had a caller restaurant tour after someone wrote a review so you had to check the description of the food in as I was doing I was like well I guess every ingredient mentioned as a fact so I'm just going to have to also came about every single ingredient as mentioned it and I only missed one they were ready to higher among a very good yeah just the fact you miss [noise]\nRemember now in the s on restaurant Oh yes yes I did an underlying restaurants which I should have because I should have checked if it was in fact pro and he had two previous restaurants or one previous restaurant\nI have to ask you are active you've all been written about do you come away from this play feeling better about the ... more frightened about the ... oh my God if there are only thirty one strip clubs and we're writing thirty four\nYou've got to read listen see with your eyes as much as you possibly can and these days and then check and fact check\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of WVU are Boston and your NPR station\nPosters Smith printing posters on wrinkle resistant fold double fabric that transports flat for conference presentations poster Smith provide that service to research communities worldwide learn more posters miss dot com\nAnd NPR and MORNING EDITION under station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis this year and now we've talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level\nSo what's at stake in state house races around the country to ... story is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures to him Oh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures of Republicans control sixty seven\nOut of the Ninety nine the reason by the way that they are and I didn't notice because one state the ... does not have both the house and Senate they only have one a chamber but the Democrats only control thirty two wire Republican so dominant at the state level\nWilbur well with a straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they ruined candidates that have fared well and and you know they they they did\nSecond of strong elections and four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight\nBut in terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments are in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\n[noise] well they run on issues like are lowering lowering taxes uh they certainly also run on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that\nI'm so they have the they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on implementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on taxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and a and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care\nAt a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy coming from Washington on the federal level and so the Republicans I really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans in edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nThat is correct in in a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of\nA group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines\nAnd in most cases their own state legislator line that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape and the state is that they had\nA very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten which meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that\nAnd um and so they drew lines were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade but yes the the twenty twenty cents as right around the corner and this is kind of the first election to tease it up and of course the twenty twenty ... election itself will be the big for redistricting\nRight but this one uh about an eight to the people who are elected this year are going to play a role at least that many are going to play a role in drawing those maps in two years\nRight near me that there are over eight hundred legislative seats that will be filled in less than a week from now I'm by legislate tours legislative\nWe're going to be elected next Tuesday and you know ... that has a an effect that goes beyond just two years or policymaking in the next legislative sessions and two thousand and Twenty one but I'm a redistricting can have a lasting impact throughout the rest of the next decade\nSo what do you think it's looking like this year or what are the Democrats' chances of taking back control of some of these state houses\nWell from the very beginning we knew that this would be a democratic opportunity year they would have the wind at their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans\nFor a variety of reasons Republicans control about fifty six percent of all legislative seats and as you pointed out um almost two thirds of all the legislative chambers and legislatures around the country\nSo they're sort of in a tough position where they're basically playing defense around the country and there's also this very strong historic trend about a strong of a trend in politics as you'll find anywhere which is\n... since Nineteen hundred so going back twenty nine mid term election cycles the party and the White House loses seats in state legislatures and twenty seven of those twenty nine mid term elections\nSo the party out of the White House is almost always looking to make a ground to gain seats in legislatures as well as in the U.S house\nAnd it looks like that's where it's going to head this time the Democrats are running more candidates and they've run in Thirty years\nUm they have raised a tremendous amount of money unprecedented amount of money that they're putting into legislative campaigns around the country so ah you know Republicans are not exactly mailing it in there fighting hard for the ah the majority that they have in ... and states legislatures\nBut um but it's really the the Democrats who you know sort of have the momentum\nUh when we'd been traveling around the country talking about congressional races I I've been surprised although maybe I shouldn't have been that a lot of people don't know who their member of Congress is they do know that they're going to vote for either a Democrat or Republican\nOr in many cases but what about state legislators due to most people know who they're voting for did they just end up voting party line\nWell sad to say most of them do not know who they're voting for me they might sort of here the names or is there a target voter they're certainly getting inundated with mailers and in some cases TV ads even you know widely broadcast the TV ads and some of these legislative races\nBut you know despite the fact that legislatures budget over three trillion dollars in public money tax money every year\nAnd despite the fact that they're setting policy on education and and a criminal justice crime and punishment on healthcare on it\nWellesley low it's it's you know probably not much better for the U.S house um so you know we would encourage people these raises are extraordinarily important not just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do\nAnd um and then to your point and it didn't it does sort of turned into something of a referendum on the parties\nAnd one of the biggest issues for legislative candidates is is President Trump\n[noise] she'll give us an example of a state house race uh that's really tight somewhere in the country and a sense of what's at stake\n[noise] well there there are number of them and there are several state Senate swear stuff's a change of one seat will change control of the chamber in Maine and Minnesota\nIn Colorado and Minnesota there's one special election and it's for all the marbles whichever party wins that will control the Minnesota Senate in right now the Minnesota houses Republican um there's a race for governor so that that's also and about\nSo um [noise] you know this one race which has had seen close to a million dollars in campaigning it's a heavily Republican district but if it goes one way or the other you know that party will control\nHow much do the parties get involved in these races that the parties in Washington did they jump in with their money and say we want this person to when we want that person to win\nMore than ever so particularly on the Democratic side the Democrats learned from getting show lack in two thousand ten and by the way that was Brock Obama's where we got shellacking down ballot in these legislative races and of course they paid the price because of the redistricting advantage Republicans had\nSo in this cycle protect on the Democratic side and they have really ramped up their fundraising and their distribution and the sophistication of how they spend that money how they do\nUm you know sort of a voter registration projects\nUm get out the vote projects in the parochial ground game but also big time outside TV buys um you know things you would see in congressional races you now see fairly commonly in pivotal state legislative races and that is being supported heavily by national party operations\nAnd so it's not just the Democrats they just increased fairly substantially from where they were just a few years ago they are now paying a lot more attention\nTo the state races but both parties are going all in on these races\nYou said President Obama said ... I remember President George W. Bush called the law says that he faced a thumping I think maybe it's now or something that the president has to do is come up with a word or for that first maternal\nIf the Republicans are really take it on the chant in it and it turns into a a really bad night a large a democratic night um then yeah they'll have to get creative get the word Smith is generating\n[noise] the dismal words that a is an allergist with diet and show lacking [noise] ten storey director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures thank you so much [noise] oh my pleasure thank you for having me on [noise]", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "31"}
