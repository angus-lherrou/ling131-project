Bless keep running\nWe've been following her recovery ever since pious reasonably left San Bernardino for Flagstaff, Arizona to start over and Julie ... joins us to talk about it Julie it's great to talk to you again and why did you want to move to Flagstaff\nWell through the county I got a medical retirement my husband decided to retire and we just wanted a chart we needed a fresh fresh start over ... ... because of what happened a couple of years ago yeah\nIt was just really tough being there I became separated from the county when I got my ah\nMedical retirement so I'm On my own with medical and doing things and we just decided we wanted that kind of a smaller town a safer atmosphere and I'm just a quieter common life\nAnd what do you mean by your on your own with medical\nWell once I separated from the county and like I was required to resign um from my job and then once the resignation took place than I Am a responsible for all my medical care from here on well and how how is that working out financially [noise]\nUm well my husband has in health insurance so for me personally it it okay\nFor some of my co workers have had to do the same thing um you know they're paying for their own health insurance on their own now and it that it had her since we talked last I've had\nI think five surgeries and seven hospitalizations with each hospitalization with each surgery I had to wait for the county to approve any kind of treatment and oftentimes\nSales so I Would rather take care of my own rather than waiting for them to approve or denied treatment\nWe heard so many people and we have after every single tragedy like this politicians come out and say we're going to be with you all the victims or will help you out do you feel like you didn't get that help\nAbsolutely that's correct with our county ... county family and that you know they'll take care of us were county family really what they want my my impression if they want to to sweep the way we were\n[noise] you know we were a stain on the county um even for that\nSecond anniversary they did nothing there was nothing they said there should be a moment of silence you know eleven o'clock or something but that's it there was no memorial there was no there was nothing [noise]\nNow you have started taking classes in graphic design or you're fifty three right now yeah so I was doing a career change\nIt's different it's something I really enjoy\nSo we'll see how it goes it may or may not lead to anything it may just be something that I that I Do on my own that I enjoy it may not be a real real career change\nI met you might just enjoy this retirement and uh spending time with my family and walking my dog than blurring Flagstaff northern Arizona area\nAre you doing physically after all those surgeries [noise]\nI think I'm doing better now I'm actually been very healing to be able to talk and to talk to law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from that\nFrom the victims and survivors point of view and you met because of our story yes well he actually heard me on the on that um interview\nAnd reached out to get a hold of me and then we connected and um since we've been excellent you know really really good friends in fact he just came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch\nSo great [noise] and what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings\nSo we tell them art variance they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned each of us\nHad such a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also [noise]\n[noise] I supervisors position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own net chip\nAs what they experienced and what was running through their mind and how law enforcement really how they can improve their responses for the victims side [laughter] I Know quite a few of my co workers all they solve with law enforcement they're boots\nAnd in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them and so you know the law enforcement hadn't really thought about that but just the shoes someone sing issues alone would make people assumed they were bad\n[noise] I recently met a I'm a teacher from Parkland high school in Florida [laughter] run into the building to help save people during that shooting and\nAfter I found out about him I didn't know what to say to him for for several minutes I sat there and I I I just didn't even know Dru Joyce thank him do I say great job or or whatever when people meet you and find out what you've been through one of those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured that they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice\nI think they expect to see someone ... much more crippled maybe even looking more emotionally crippled if that makes sense so typically they're more shock that I went through that and I'm standing there looking kind of to normal to them\nIs it difficult for you to talk to them about what happened\nIt's not now I think a thanks to these presentations and I've done it's actually been really healthy to repeat the story and just said the story to become um\nMore\nMaybe I don't know natural or it's allowed me to remove myself a little bit from it I think it's actually it's been very healing for me\nThere have been so many other shootings since we last spoke have your views changed at all on or have you developed any idea about what could be done to stop this from happening\nI I it's so frustrating to me and it just always\nThe weapons like the air are Fifteen and these weapons that are made to hunt human being really that's what they're made for they're not made for going in sport shooting or hunting is made for hunting humans\nAnd it's frustrating to me that there's so readily available in this country because it seems that all the shootings these mass shootings have involved that type of weapon and do you think that anything will be done about that\nI don't think anything's going to be done anytime soon unfortunately now\nWhen we talk to you in twenty sixteen you showed us some of the things that people had given you to help you recover a star of hope at a medal given to you after the attack by one of your nurses [noise] do you still have\nThose things yes and

Scott hey Jeremy and with me in the studio K PCC in Pasadena as Mary Plummer whose political correspondent\nFor K. PCC Hi Mary ... so let's start with the governor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race\nIs between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom\nA Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox Scott you just moderated the first and possibly only debate this week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poorest state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle\nThe vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget and here's Republican John Cox\nA vision of this state being affordable unlivable for people uh I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento uh the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nGot new some has a big lead in the polls is Cox have a chance\nWell it's tough the math is tough for him or the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California to thousands fix his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking there now literally a third party in California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate\nA decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent and the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when you have to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some\nConservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough\nPlace California is for Republicans to win state wide\nIt's new some wins a merry will it be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know I'm kind of her brand has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and you indicated he'd pick a similar approach especially on issues like immigration healthcare environmental issues I knew some support sanctuary cities for example he back to California to cutting edge zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are a couple of areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown hat\nAnd one of those areas is early childhood and during the recession the funding for programs like infant toddler care and pre school was severely cut and those have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown using his indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that issue reflected in TV ads that he's running laugh\nWhen as you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump to the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nSo I think the government's doing a terrible job running the state of California and you know I have property in California I Will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property in California\nThe taxes are way way out of whack\nSuck to move pretty soon then if you don't have safety meaning if you don't have this kind of wall the drugs are pouring through in California that do it\nJust got a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters or prepare to go to the polls next month\nWell in like a lot of blue states\nTrump did and he still way underwater or last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters so uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nUh their problem and these really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he was not going to be helpful to these Republican candidates are in persuading them to vote for for the Republican and he's congressional races\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nI forwarded melody homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in that congressional races\nAnd you know there are just as she ended up in a foreign ability that I think a lot of these new party preference and others at which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nUh let's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat\nBecause in California the top two vote getters face each other in the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh hearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nThis isn't a political battle for power as some have said this is undertaking with serious allegations Scott is chief vulnerable\nMaybe [laughter] certainly she's been ahead and every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary uh you know I think\nKevin deli on just hasn't been her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media aren't paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nUh and and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo ah and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race altogether and a vet I'm not sure it's going to help\nMore of a centrist than her opponent or so it's possible certainly uh it's it's not entirely clear how this Kavanaugh saying is playing for her I've heard women very strongly defending her that she was we're spending Christine Ford and and you know so they're not critical but you know I haven't seen\nBroad well the one thing that we one thing that we have seen is that I'm In Saturday Night live has made fun of the fact that a lot of the people on both sides of the aisle during those Kavanaugh hearings were pretty old she's eighty five years old he's fifty one or he's talked about that he's careful about it but he used to listen to him talking to us\nAbout the fact that he says he's going to have a new generation of leadership\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules a in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated and no longer apply to a to California and to the rest of the country\nMarry the age issue is that on voters' minds\nAnd you know I think it is first time especially for younger voters here in California and\nDaily and arguments are certainly resonates most with the progressive side of the Democratic party here you know if we find a ... twenty sixteen Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign had a very active group of supporters in California\nAnd many of them are young people getting engaged in politics for the first time some of those folks are resonating more out and looking for a change in the Senate race\nBut as Scott mentioned at the polling indicates you know strong favorability for Feinstein ... watching as the head she seems to have a pretty substantial question right now but we're still you know little little over a little less than a month away\nRight and Scott there's one thing we haven't talked about that has come up in our conversation here in Southern California which is that there is a measure on the ballot to repeal a gas tax that may actually play a role in getting people out to the polls\nWell that's what Republicans were hoping Jeremy they put prop six on the ballot in fact John Cox the Republican candidate for governor really funded that drive to collect the signatures put it on the ballot polling shows it's not as popular\nAs you might expect a because you know everyone pays the gas tax if you drive a no one's particularly happy about having to pay it it's about uh twelve cents per gallon tax but it generates five billion dollars a year for transportation roads bridges highways and so the no on sex campaigns done I think a pretty good job of saying they're trying to take away money\nFunding for here and now comes from that weren't

be resolved if people were willing to work together and there's also the job creation that the opportunity in this district is amazing with the military contracting and the final check by on that\nThat is the engine of\nOur biggest problem right now is to work for it we have three point five percent unemployment and we can't good qualified health\nAnd it's hard it's hard to get people to come to California\n[noise] I'm Daryl and I have a totally different approaches to governing I'm more of a consensus builder [noise] I like I worked across the aisle in California and many times I wasn't a minority party and that was the first Republican chair of the board and Fifteen Years which was unusual how\nClosely aligned argue with President Trump because you do have is indoors [noise]\nWell there's a lot like on the ... and the economic front unlike a lot on the economic front I'm not a fan of the approach he's kind of got the good cop bad cop in reverse generally the elected person is Dr touch\nBut he's kinda frontal and I think it makes it a difficult to people understand\nI think in this district because we're not used to that kind of approach but I think the result she's gotten on the budget a\nTax reform has really helped district help the states where do you disagree with Trump [noise]\nWell I would've liked to have seen of the political I kept seeing a little bit more a provision for California in our tax reform on the salt treatment but that really wasn't that was the Congress\nI think that um [noise]\nI I think more in the mannerisms and also I I'm not for offshore drilling and I think California has a beautiful coastline we don't want that the health care we have we have to do something about the health care health care right now in California is\nOkay but Medicaid funding that we'd accept it a lot of is driving providers out in the market because it's a state is holding back on the on the reimbursement rates very very difficult for some people are the APA actually worked pretty well in California because we've got a huge population but\nThere and again we were seeing providers drop out of the market so there's a lot of things to be worked on health care [noise] what about\nWhat we just saw with Brett Kavanaugh\nHow do you feel about how the Senate handled his confirmation\nI thought it was hard core solitaire I didn't like it should have all been vetted free hearing the United states the people of the country should not have been dragged into that I don't think it did anything tonight is it's created a lot of chaos and\nDysfunction one of the things that some voters know about you here in orange county is that your husband was caught up in a pond [noise] what do you want people to know about that\nAnd uh do you think that they should be judging you on that at all [noise]\nNumber one that's a lie there with no Ponzi scheme do I want to set the record clear\nEverything it was simple it was never a criminal litigation that civil litigation where you can throw anything against the wall and tried to make it and it went through a jury trial\nSo I really do believe that it's been misrepresented than politicians when they have no record to run on frequently like the old old filing this was a huge litigation but I was cleared in two thousand Thirteen do you think that that's hurting you know in this race well if you can't defend yourself it does but I've\nGot to actually you know are are asking about it now and I'm explaining it it's on my website\nI tell the story I tell what happened it was two thousand they\nAnybody involved in real estate understand the problems in two thousand eight the bank folded a\nProperty we're seeing it was it was miserable and Mr Leavenworth for country wide and he said there's an excuse for for for anything on people but the but the brand new brand new attorney and the group and and they get to a brand new guys these kinds of dirty job to do\nWhat do you think the biggest issue for voters in his district this year\nI think the dysfunction in the same [noise] you know the this started than teach meant hearing and all the chaos going on they don't know if you don't want politics they want some results [noise] Diane Harkey Republican running for Congress here thank you so much thank you [noise]\nParties opponent is the guy she was just talking about a lawyer and first time candidate Mike Lebanon we met him at his campaign office in San Clemente and I asked him why he's running\nWell for the last two decades I've been involved in a variety of political campaigns I've never felt compelled to run before myself\nA after having been very involved in twenty sixteen election\nOr to help Secretary Clinton a and after seeing that result my wife and I both decided what good is our background or experience or education or relationships the values that we have the values that we want to share with our own children or if we don't stand up and try to do something for our country right now\nHow much of an uphill climate that for you as a Democrat running in orange county and part of San Diego county\nWell the good news is that in the primary on June fifth fifty one and a half percent of the vote went to the Democratic candidates so the momentum is on our side a President Trump's approval rating in our district is right around forty percent of people are ready for new leadership\nJustice and I ultimately I Want to see a a a an investigation by Mr Mahler or that or is not politicized\nOr what we have seen with Devon noon as as chair of the house intelligence committee is the withholding of relevant testimony and information and you know the other side you know they're they're making us to be a beep beep some are angry mob or they're saying you know don't give matches due to an arsonist\nCouldn't be further from the truth we care about our country we care about the rule of law there cannot be one set of rules for the press the United states and one set of rules for everyone else that's not how\nOur founders so you know created this a democratic\nRepublic that we live in our constitution still matters\nYou bring up the line about the angry mob how much do you think that what just happened with Brett Kavanaugh has changed the dynamics of your race has it energized Republicans more energized Democrats more than they were before\n[noise] well I have no idea all I Know is that um you know yesterday day before we have an extraordinary number of volunteers more than we'd ever seen\nA and I don't know how much of that was related to a now justice cabinet or not but what I can tell you is that uh we're doing everything we can to take nothing for granted over the last month of this campaign we are going to ah just do an incredible amount of work and I won't predict anything other than that we will out works the other side\nWe asked your opponent Diane Harkey about ah something that's been dug in her campaign which is that her husband had to pay a penalty for being involved in a Ponzi scheme she said that's a lie what do you think\nUm I think the victims deserve to be heard and the facts are very simple ah her husband a endpoint center of financial was found by both the\nUh jury as well as a a judge and then an appellate court to be a Ponzi scheme to be financial fraud and dozens of seniors were defrauded out of millions and millions of dollars and\nHer husband her ex husband or they have not paid nearly enough to those victims\nShe also ah in her answer to our question about that\nTried to connect you to country wide which was responsible for a lot of foreclosures I've seen that on your website you say I was just a junior lawyer working on for bank of America which country wide and I'd have to to do with that not at all she's\nTried to create false equivalence between uh you know the serious\nErnie I'm proud of my work as an attorney I've tried to do the right thing I've tried to stand up for people in the record is on my side in my case uh there was a very unscrupulous attorney a guy named Mitchel Roth who was disbarred and had to pay over a million dollars in restitution or because he too was trying to defraud\nHunting for here and now comes from W.

growing ethnic group in this state they now make up more than fourteen percent of the population a slice of the pie that has tripled in size since Nineteen eighty and in orange county where there are four congressional races that the cook Political Report labels competitive\nIt's about eight hundred thousand of right now we are\nOver twenty percent of the county and third largest Asian American population in the nation\nMarion food executive director of the Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander community alliance fifty Asian Americans living here are people with roots in the Philippines China Korea Vietnam Japan and more that's been the case for decades the difference now is a greater number of those people were born in the United states\nI think it's probably about thirty thirty five percent right now I'm Seventy percent of the community is foreign born ... cording to the sense that you see more and more diversity here in orange county and you'll see more of a rising second generation\nThat's important because the politics of the generations can be completely different Alex Kim is principal and CEO of three kings public affairs he's Korean American and a registered Republican who worked as a political consultant for Democrat James harm the former mayor of Los Angeles and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger the former governor of California\nPerson ration tend to vote Republican and my second generation of friends are more on the Democratic side why is that\nMaybe it's because of a little bit of rebellion a butt up at the same time it's similar to how Cuban Americans of Vietnamese Americans come from a country that came from a lot of trauma more types of financial distress is the first generation\nTend to say why be what Republicans because the TV the corruption the government the distrust of government and why the second generation going more democratic I think because of the American values the\nThis Korean Americans that grew up in ... uh tend to grow up in urban areas and I think that's part of the process or in urban areas and\nOne of the first issues on the minds of Asian American voters is immigration he and others are concerned about President Trump's policies family separation and chain migration\nAnd the thought of eliminating about because a lot of my relatives came here to chain migration so\nAnd the question the workforce and how a lot of the small businesses are immigrants come from about chain migration system so it seems like Korean Americans the first generation still are more majority loyal to Trump no matter what they believe they came here legally\nA of a majority of them and they believe that what he's doing is fair for the country would definitely be the my friends I mean more democratic or liberal Republicans are progressive republic somersault have have definitely some qualms about the key issue [noise]\nMany of the first generation Asian immigrants here are small business owners running nail salons dry cleaners restaurants Kim says the Koreans often use Korean community banks because back in the day it was difficult for them to get loans from American banks\nThen there are Vietnamese American business owners like tan and sunny new when we met them at a cafe sunny owns it in orange county neighborhood called little Saigon lending told us the politics here are shifting\nDefinitely changing I I think you know you look at generation one which is our parents um salmon I we we're all one point fight and we we grew up we were were not born here in the U.S so we were in Vietnam\nBut we were raised\nIn America so we understand what it means to be an American but we also understand our parents were they came from so we can relate to both sides and because we can relate to both sides we can see the differences and it's a stark difference what do you mean by that [noise]\nUm and not just from a political standpoint but how we do business so speaking just for our business and how we do things our parents always said hey you know what they came from a country where you can't really trust the government so stay away from it so we came over here you see a lot of our visit family\nCash only pay you know what you don't want to say what we have our own strategies that we don't want to share best practice because that becomes very competitive as well and that's why first generation they're known\nTo be very fragmented\nRight and um you don't want to collaborate so we grew up in America and you know I worked in corporate America and there's there's a lot of collaboration and that's how we actually grew in [noise] you know and being an American or you know and having it includes city I think that's one of the reasons why we have grown that because we do\nWe're sharing a best practice we actually sharing best practices entrepreneur and they're getting better but because we're doing now we're able to work together and that's one of the big differences from generation one\nOutside the cafe in little Saigon our political science attached to a fence at a busy intersection nearly every candidate's name is Vietnamese the only Asian American running for Congress this year in orange county it's fifty five year old young Kim a Korean American Republican who worked for the lawmaker she's trying to replace ed Royce\nWhen my family came to
