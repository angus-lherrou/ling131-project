S. borders to stop them that's on top of the already Twenty one hundred National Guards men that are down patrolling the border to stop what is now about thirty five hundred migrants um that are trying to make their way up\nI'm so there he's really seizing upon immigration I mean this is a strategy that worked for him obviously and twenty sixteen and when they're trying to combat what many are predicting will be this blue wave in this midterm election he's just going back to the playbook that worked for him and saying hey let's just hammer down on immigration over and over and see if that works\nAnd those migrants are that you're talking about by the way they're\nOver a month away from the United states by walking and that's if they go about thirty miles per day\nExactly so the idea of having the military on the border right now is probably not necessary to put it mildly\n\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

hundred nine four seven auto\nThis this year and now we had the rare opportunity last week to speak with Alan Greenspan the man who led the Federal Reserve from Nineteen eighty seven to two thousand six he served through booms and recessions he's now Ninety two we asked him about the recent volatility in the stock market I think it's first refer to compromise\nThe market itself is doing for the ten year treasury note unsanitary or treasury bond they've moved up significantly\nWe also asked him whether the tax cuts had already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nThe impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the impact of the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with them about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in America a history which he co authored with Adrian ... rich I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nWho have more than two\nIt's more directly related to a\nStructure of the company for example the so called rust belt and his populated largely by industries which are very old\nSilicon Valley for example is a classic case of a very new\nTo a very different pockets of economic growth and various degrees of stagnation\nThrew out the country and it depends obviously whether your grocery in areas where it was sort of been prices means something or whether you're on the west coast\nOr the issue of high tech stock prices ... everyone talks about so one thing about this country which is very diverse and it depends where you are\nYou right in your book that the growth surge out of the country experience from Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand for it increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much longer term decline rather than the dawn of a new era of tech driven growth why do you say that\nWell when you look out into the future\nAll we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity swine well basically because sooner you know when to deal with fear is very difficult to classify it\nBut you can you can look at the consequences of it on the consequence is basically a suppressed level of innovation under four of capital investment\nAnd uh just inclination to take risks in the book and I might add discussing what are the lowest the long term outlook is all about we say that\nAnd so having a significant negative deterioration over the long run\nThe reason for that is what the data on a critically show inside and title months which are mandated by law\nA gradual eight hundred inexorably driving our gross domestic savings and the economy dollar for dollar on so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is our current account deficit and\nWe're now built up in a trillion dollar debt to foreigners\nOr what this is causing this as long as the demographic issue the fact that the population is aging right now the official actuaries other Social Security system say in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds\nAnd balance they'd have to cut benefits are twenty five percent and definitely into the future to do you think they should do that [laughter]\nFirst of all the drugs that gets going to happen I don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation\nIs the major problem out there so long as you don't do it causes the debt overall the total government that to go over a rise indefinitely\nAnd that is an unstable situation\nWhere you say inflation it it it's a big problem out there and we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nThat's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about it for example interest rates and ... century bc Greece when not terribly different from where they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise for no other reason that they're below the long term human nature to determine stability\nWhat do you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or or right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nReason we ship rates low as three on employment rates so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace\nWe did move is that we didn't see the signals and indeed the unemployment rate kept swollen well below a brief usual expectation over like four percent\nBut with productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh the unemployment rate kept fooling below four percent with no impact on inflation\nSo it is does low interest rates were not a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that in two thousand I think\nThat what we specifically learn strangely for the first time in two thousand and is there a two conditions as quiet for a crisis\nOne is there a toxic assets like a secured a storm mortgages but the critical issue is how those mortgages financed and whether the U.S announced a butter leverage that that's the dangerous signal\nYou see anything like that right now no not in any area\nWell general you know that that was a very extraordinary period in court narrowly [noise] it would have been wholly inappropriate for the Federal Reserve to keep rates down during the period of very low unemployment that was what the period was\nI was having a conversation with somebody in the banking industry recently who said that one of their concerns was that unemployment is so low right now I'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nFor jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that that the people that want to hire are having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that that it's going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWell basically it's not lower productivity but it's an issue when you get to sort of tight labor market wage ... of necessity\nAnd it's the wage rate rises which affects the cost of production and hence induce corporations to start raising prices basically because their costs are going up that's where the problem\nBuck or an as an issue of creative destruction um first of all I explain what that means\nA creative destruction is the process by which people\nDo two things they continuously invest but the investment is displacing older equipment but more importantly it engenders unemployment and uh\nIt's to process which unfortunately is a necessary condition for growth and standards of living\nYou have to let bad things happen in order for the overall picture to be better in the future\nWell because the very nature of progress economically as we point out in the book is the result of creative destruction which means essentially for example when a big open heart front us kind of been in the steel industry\nA whole slew of procedures within the steel industry in so called ... furnaces\nThey became obsolete and they were scraps but also workers associated with those particular furnaces so to speak they lose their jobs too with the political forces continuously changing\n\nFunding for here

sixty nine they all spent time in the squirrel hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh which has been in the news because of this tragedy it's leafy streets and historic houses much of the population is Jewish\nBut it's also Mr Rogers actual neighborhood it's we're Fred Rogers lived when he was making a show a show we wish we had to help us through a week like this were British ... is executive director with the Fred Rogers center she's with us\nFrom ... Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh that's where Rogers was born a he moved to grow hill when he got married uh Roberta thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrel\nHill well then this is really sad\nAnd the diversity in the community of parochial\nAnd um he loved walking down the streets and I'm noticing the trees and then the various temples and synagogues and churches\nUm that um made him feel at home um that that Greece but delicatessens and Iraq and commented that you could hear ... fever and a dozen other languages spoken actually walk down the street that community you actually learn uber didn't\nHe get gas or do you think that part of the Mr Roger's neighborhood that we saw on television was based on scroll hill\n[noise] um [noise] they can not just neighborhood I think I'm certainly had\nSome of the philosophy of the squirrel hill neighborhood um you know I think that it it was a fantasy neighborhood the neighborhood of make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another which certainly I think what's reflected to him is through the ... community\nAnd probably a second term community where he grew up during\nThe time he made a show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence are we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination\nThat word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers I did and a puppet Daniel tiger had\nThis question for lady ...\nFascination me [noise]\n\n\nHave you heard that word a lot today [noise]\nAnd I didn't know what it means\n[noise] means [noise]\nSomebody getting killed in sort of surprised way\nWhich happened you know kill me\nI Know and a lot of people are talking about it right now too many people are talking about a lot of people are scared about it you know [noise]\nI'd rather talk about some other day he like [noise]\nThat sound are courtesy of the Fred Rogers company late ... lady\nUh she says that's okay what do you think Fred Rogers taught kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw the Pittsburgh and\nI think one of the things that she taught us how is that it's All right to have these feelings to feel sad and to feel angry and to be afraid that there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone so for children the message was that\nA drone up for there to listen and I think that the message to Graham naps where\nIt's listening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about it and helping them\nTo learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the health fairs and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area what we saw where all the helpers the emergency response team the police officers the firefighters the ambulances that doctors the nurses everyone um has surrounded this community with caring\nAnd that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identified with said that they identify with the helpers and not those who who uh cause destruction\nI've seen a lot a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days looked for the helpers yes\n[noise] as part of that same special or that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence let's listen\nI've been terribly concerned\nAbout the graphic display of violence\nWhich the media has been showing recently\nI played for your protection\nIn support\nOf your young children\nThere is just so much\nA very young child can take\nWith out of me overwhelming\n[noise] what do you think for graduates would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\n[noise] well I I think one of the things that it probably\nAnd yet where we can talk and share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but I think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gates was that we have to figure out how to make good next attractive [laughter]\nI think that um dwelling on on the violence of course undermines that message so looking for the helpers hope to see the good that is still around us\nFor grabs you said that we have one life to live on this earth and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean his life and be hateful or we can spend that time creating a encouragement and spaces where children it and and others can use this life\nI'm In very meaningful and creatively\nOr British ... what do you think Fred Rogers and you knew Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think that you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend\nWell I think he would be horrified by what happened and and she would he would be concerned about the children she would be concerned\nThat they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may see these reactions in the adult and so it's important for us to help children learn that the feelings on normal and manageable but find ways to talk about it and find ways to express anger and find ways to express sadness\nI'm In ways that are not harmful to other people um and you know I think that that comforting neighborhoods um I think he would also say we need to turn to our neighbors and\nNeighbor in the greater sense of the world that everyone who lives on this planet is a neighbor I'm an only child and and to provide support to our neighbors to people of all backgrounds from all faiths of all races I'm\nSure that we can live together on this earth in very productive ways\nWhat's been like for you living right they're outside of Pittsburgh\nUh it's um [noise]\nWell it's been very hard I've been a meeting and talking with some of the teachers um in early childhood programs my my own background and ... and early childhood\nAnd so I've been talking to some of the teachers and the directors of programs I'm Sorry for him and said that the Jewish preschool programs

prison on those\nAnd it would you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know ... as Mike DeWine would say um you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but\nAh you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime that there's just going to open the doors to more problems so there is a real debate here on\nGet treatment for them is that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or water people what's on their minds\nBut seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people\nAre like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it ah Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid and ah because of that a lot of people who have\nOpioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions there trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and where they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it\nWhat's the polling telling you well at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind that the most recent polling shows is that that it's\nYou know very tight and uh we've got eight million voters we do have in this election that can vote and um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they were at the same point and twenty fourteen it does seem like there's a race here\n[noise] now a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal in Ohio\nAnd it is a big deal it's always a big deal but Ohioans have approved at a ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to play out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have a a good good\nOpportunity to get in there and help draw those lines and I have some effect on it\nOf joy and go through covers politics at Ohio public radio talking about the governor's race in Ohio Joe thank you thank you representatives from the Indonesian airline lion hair have announced they'll meet with us plane manufacturer Boeing\nTo discuss what caused a seven thirty seven ... a plane to crash into the sea early Monday morning\nThe plane went down just minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta\nInvestigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it turns out there were concerns about whether the aircraft was safe to fly just one day before the crash joining us now says Kaplan from airline\nReturn to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down well\nA lot of it has to do with what you just said which is information from the day before people as saying that the plane was essentially going a radically doing things that we don't usually experience during flight my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like something\nMore than that something perhaps to do with air speed indicators\nAnd a very early you have to emphasize that right now but you know if that played into this or you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft was going you could have had a stall and this wouldn't be the first time that that is happening in my mind goes to a\nA crash that some people might remember off the crush of the coast rather uh Brazil back in two thousand nine Air France flight for four seven yeah uh\nAnd and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things a mechanical issue some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but\nUh you know as much a cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes\nA which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly and the pilots\nUh you know didn't know that they were basically stalling the aircraft so a very early indications are perhaps something like that based on what seems to have happened day before but I have to emphasize we don't know exactly what was happening on on that it'll slated flight\nNow when you hear about a brand new airplane and this was a brand new airplane it had flown fewer than eight hundred hours before crashing on Monday a brand of airplanes sounds like a good thing but then you wonder you know maybe they had tested it out or nothing and there may have been a problem that didn't come up yet and here we are\nYeah it's it's so new I ... and and yeah you know legitimate to say that on the other hand you know we've all flown on on brand new airplanes and in fact you know this this max aid is is the newest kind and there are already hundreds around the world\nApplying for that matter airlines like American in southwest here in the U.S airlines like Air Canada and west jet just north of the border\nAnd and you know of course this is also very rare for something like that so sure at this point you could ... you could construct all kinds of ah you know ideas about why this could have happened\nUh but you know the newness of an airplane in and of itself shouldn't cause something any more than ... you know a very old airplane as long as it's maintained properly\nThey're they're looking the investigators it appears or looking mostly just at the mechanics of this airplane\nRight and you know the biggest question of all if we're going to be talking about the human error might not be those pilots on board again in all of this very preliminary but you know if all of that happened to the day before well what happened after that you know what was was a plane taken in for the kind of check that you would expect it to have been taken in for\n\nFunding for here and now comes from fracture creating frame let's photo decor and gift by printing
