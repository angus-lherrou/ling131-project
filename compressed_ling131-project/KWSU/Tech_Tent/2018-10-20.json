... to have evidence for British lawmakers we all were there was more than they gave me an we meet the man with a low tech approach to helping African farmers share ideas about andme about funding\nJoining me this week is BBC technology reporter that many climbing high very high like a really good to have you to guide us through the stories and my special guest Mona El ... from the

livelihoods paid for his kids to go to school at dinner and he finally table or on a disease ... killed you know roughly half of them in a space with a couple of days [noise]\nOlder that in a moment but first on Wednesday Twitter released of false data dump ten million tweets a total of three hundred and sixty gigabytes of material relating to Russian and Iranian so cool to troll farms\nThese are attempts to use Twitter to sway public opinion around the world\nMost of the tweets came from Russia's Internet research agency which has been accused of trying to sow discord in the United states and intervene in the twenty sixteen election on the house as Donald Trump\nNow twisted released this treasure trove of data as a tool for research is and journalists it gave it runs access to the think tank the Atlantic council whose digital forensic research lab took a closer look the techniques employed by the trouble farms\nAnd no matter who led the effort at the lab told me what they found\nThe assumption that being that the ... the Russian troll operation peak in twenty sixty even during the election and then it's twenty Seventeen but actually the highest ...\nPutting the Russian opposition and late twenty four team was when that was really happening\nFor you then sore eye I presume the tactics developed\n... you could really see them learning how to use social media ... at the\nStump that complaint was really quite boring it was a lot of sheds from websites and it was a lot of studies stilted comment and then you can see that individual can started getting more aggressive and more edgy and trying to be more funny and the mole they did that the more they were getting audience response and they were also watching the real world I I get the feeling\nThat they were obsessively watching the news channels and so when you called big events like um the the shooting in San Bernardino in California and December twenty Fifteen\nYou could see the Russian trolls jumping in and most of them would be pushing the message that this is why Americans need guns and then some of them were pushing the message of this is why Americans need gun control so they were watching for breaking news and then looking at how they could turn up the heat on the debate\nDid you get the idea that there was that are controlling mouth to mind behind dates or what they were heading off in different different directions\nThat was definitely some sort of editorial control going on um it didn't seem to be very fast moving and particularly in the early days you'd see a time that something would happen in the U.S let's say on ... on Monday\nOn Tuesday individual Russian trolls and start re tweeting content at it and then on Wednesday they all come out with the same halftime can they do these massive bursts of activity around ... hundreds of times in the day and you can even imagine the editorial meeting which went on Tuesday evening saying right labs tomorrow this is you'll ... you'll be posting\nObviously that was a lot of these activity I ... it seems very striking at once he just he did he does he have any evidence to change people's votes\nShe used to have to and people are studying computer science asked them\nAll kinds of areas are actually crucial to the future among shut the robo\nEven asking that river any different questions you want to interrupt you get like you might within the witness you weren't doing follow ups you are protecting the right but with a lot smarter than it was\nWell of course it broke both been programs in and phone so he knew the path I knew the questions but\nIt it wasn't meant to be a kind of special most it was trying to do was one demonstrated papers the program would be young students sects university a really great university or the ... that they had dominant take an enormous amount of time but also showcase some of the work of ripple sticks announcers intelligence I pet ...\nTalks about the ... uh uh it it did and um it's companion sold in terms of a health care which is going to be a hugely important um with the arrival of both us revolution\nOn you're giving a false idea of what a ... a professor at Oxford University who leads that AI or if it said on sports that it was a a a guinea pig I gather that the wrong impression of AI\nLife's all about tweets and I have to say it was incredibly snooty we were trying to bring the community to millions of people in fact that you were talking about it being on the BBC Television um it's been across the media because the public and also with us\nImpacts so we were some case in the work of students I'm showing potentially will can be done to put a little tight stuff for what could happen in the future but also stressing that we need to meet all skills deficit because of all the way the also thought is going to fundamentally change over the next and when he says he is\n[noise] robot house on and pay a ... else how are you are listening to that um I don't know if you saw the right button and a half ago and it was quite amusing did you think it was a useful exercise\nI think the second time we had like major appearance of fraud but taking over that they've surfing on their life here Saudi Arabia gave a Robin ... citizenship and yeah ... I think\nThat would not seek to isn't it\nLike to thank the worldly have this technology and I think it's it's good to to do this too racy but we're ... we're going to another Arab but I don't know how useful politically and how he saw that testimony\nWas climbing you and I both met pepper I thing I've met a fair it's not only was there no that small that you would go off completely false impression of how clever those rebels would\nYeah I think I think you and I are around ... we'd probably see see through at that and there's a big marketing campaign behind ... and my general expenses that said no I think that you know easily just going to have a chat like we are and it's like I said\nYeah you don't get a good conversation with the right but\nThat's been on the smartphone has revolutionized all kinds of industries but one businesses trying to show that you can transform farming in developing countries with much simpler sirens we from is a social network for farmers in Kenya and Uganda with plans to expand elsewhere in Africa and Asia\nIt depends entirely on text messages which the problem is used to see you can share advice and he's just signed up its millions member I spoke to ... founder and chief executive Kenny you and I'm often what kind of people used it\nGuess at a primary level we're targeting people you don't have those other ways of communicating with each other so roughly speaking the world about a billion a small scale farmers are mostly in sub Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia is off no connection to the Internet and therefore up a massive information gap of finding\nA information knowledge and high temperature farmer or ... disease so we farm or we enable those farmers to be able to ask a question on anything to do with agriculture and just about any local language for free I guess\nSimple technology it's SMS does does that well\nSo it's it's simple in the front and a son that's a message obviously a hundred and sixty character as it's a very simple information format but I think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology that has to be behind the scenes in order to get good content people in such a simple format\nAs open a former U.S as a question or for example on on SMS\nWe've had these machine learning and to understand everything that farmers trying to tell us you know what is they're entitled to question where are they what are they farming and essentially use that analysis to match them to ... you know three or four people in our entire network that we can answer that one individual question and getting up his book content back to the original farmer\nNow you you've got to a million members I think you just signed up a million the million member ... what evidence do you have that he's making a difference to people [noise]\nYeah so ... million which this is obviously a great milestone for us having to one point in ... um I mean I think the the ... biggest uh indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it\nOr even people who have been with us for two or three years since we launched um so about twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute content every month or which you know that in context is is probably in your seven or eight percent on Twitter\nUm you know we know protests more than a million questions and answers every single month which gives you an indication of the level of content that we find is necessarily a fun systems here there's not a social system itself I value for their businesses and people don't come back and keep using things for business unless they're getting some sort of value out of it so I think that's probably the primary indicator that would say\nUh we also obviously speak a lot to our farmers on the ground or we need to understand how they are using it and what sort of benefits they're seeing from it\nAnd we've got some you know many great stories of farmers have um you know literally had information it's help them save or their livelihoods wind farms through reform was an example of how it's been years\nOr so I mean the example I gave is that there's a chicken farmer that I was using we farm and in Kenya called called ... he kept on the in the region of of fifty chickens I'm as and this was entire livelihoods paid for his kids to go to school at dinner and he finally table\nOr on a diseases ... killed so you know roughly half of them in the space of a couple of days or any ask questions about this on we farming get information back a which vaccines two years I did I just thought the disease spreading and he managed to save the rest of east chickens um which is I mean that's that is the minds entire livelihoods and that's that's the kind of light 'til\nYou know often seems to us fairly basic information but it incredibly fundamental to these farmers that we found is able to to to provide\nKenny you in from\nOne of those red now public a positive stories about social media or five years or so ago and one of those social media was going to say the word was was a positive uses we're all that changed totally\nYes a Santa and live in was the year we celebrate and social media we thought it was going to the world ... ... people and a three Terry genes to move to towards democracy to mobilize masses\nI tore the voice of opposition but this was in ... near where government and regime weren't involved in the spot for him it was a platform only for activists real people very very few\nPeople doing practical things like that\nYeah ... exactly will use social campaigns to reach people over and it's about stuff but\nLater on we started moving to regimes and the bad guys as we can call going there and propagating to to their own benefit so it's now a battle between two items they that the\nPeople people who want to have a voice and people who want to manipulate them so this is why we now or ... get to the facts however we cannot forget that social media still can connect people together so have many many many positive effects but\nOf course the propaganda gets the highlight of the time\nOr I mean ... still very important um uh an eighties eighties connecting people than positive ways as well uh [noise] do you have a kind of open rules view of whether we're getting more good than bad from it\nBut we're still getting good but we're getting bad now in last seven maybe seven years ago I Would have told us that we're getting old me good but now we're getting good and bad on the bad maybe ... takes over if we couldn't control it ... and make sure it's it's under control maybe we don't know\nOne very brief woods and use very climbing are you still positive about social media\nI think it gets a big kicking and right and you say that I think that's another good that comes out but it's not I for one another\nThat's always going to try for anything on the positive thanks to my special guest Mona Eltahawy
