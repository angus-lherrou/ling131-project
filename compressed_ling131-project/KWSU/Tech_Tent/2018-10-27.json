nobody needs ...\nExactly and and you know I'm only ... main right it'd be great to have clean caused by passed but\nWe're going to need what will be more than a thousand times as much electricity is we have now it's just crazy amounts of more electricity if we're going to challenge allegedly close so we're going to yeah look I Need to build a lot of power stations before all the cooking and electric\nAs our climate you lived deep in the countryside or some way from London I'm at ... be good for you but\nWhat I'm seeing a rise ... where I live out in the states that people having high

happened has become in Brazil\nWatch soap is very important the company said\nA hundred and twenty million people use watts up in Brazil and the population is two hundred and ten million has become and Brazil almost like a social media and not only an instant messaging app where people participate in groups with people they don't know from around Brazil and chat with them\nOne hypothesis is that this happened\nBecause of how mobile\nCheap and readily available to and how is it being abused cheering the present and elections\nSo we found out that there are ... that are buying devices that can scrape people's numbers from Facebook and then use these numbers to target them with lots of messages they can put people in in lots of groups and they can to send the message is individually about\nCandidates or when they put people in lots of groups one marketeers who I spoke to with told me he would put a a person and a group and the group would have a name that is not related to candidates specifically like political debate\nAnd then people would start talking but there were would be to uh people infiltrated from the campaign that will try to lead these people on and make them support the candidate and this is just a little fringe activity or is that an awful lot of this happening\nWhile we can't say for sure how many people are using this but in our report we saw that this has has been used by different candidates in Brazil and different parties lots of different parties\nAnd lots of has played a big part in this campaign in Brazil are very big part uh so we have sixty six percent of the voters saying that they have used watts up they use watts up in Brazil\nAnd ah the far right candidate presidential candidate staples for NATO\nOr whose campaign is is being
