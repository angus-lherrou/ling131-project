[noise] but [noise] these\n[noise]\nThe shootings do just continue to happen [noise]\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare like the staff at the school [noise]\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shooting to look for the past to just pay the future [noise]\nKnowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish it we shouldn't gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our show today where people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put in measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough back to where people who invented something that actually seems to work and help from WBEZ in Chicago\nIt's this American Life Ira Glass [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nLike one ... will never be\nPretty school they're trying to figure out the best way to prepare for gunmen there's an example out there that might be really helpful\nAnd that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just among before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school\nThe teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning and the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think they could have been more prepared than anywhere I say I mean they knew what to do we even sell even when we still had the\nCasualties but I'm going to return to their families\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it was actually an open question when our producers Robin ... went to ... to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school with an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDoug lifted the school with eleven building than over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures to month to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments multiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that\nOf once she and the other teachers have been trained they ran their students are all the new drills old school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for a fire for every series forever and this is what occurred black and this is what we do it for two days for two days we went over to procedures with\nThe kids might have to do with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids [noise]\nKnew the procedures that it was like ingrained in their mind and that they knew so if they were asking us silver day they would get it on a burgundy day school colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise]\nWas it that their kids to the drill\nSeriously on a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten the school\nTold every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors with paper\nAnd leave the paper up all year just in case if there were on it would make it harder for an active\nShooter to see in that's a lesson from previous shooting get out of sight before Columbine very few schools did active shooter drills now nearly Twenty years later most of them do\nActually correct teaches calling area Douglas she's level headed pragmatic like a person who spent years working in the restaurant kitchen not living are cool what she did actually remembers being trained with other teachers on the new procedures last year it started with them to nine one one audio from Sandy Hook\n\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there was another smaller\nKids that are running towards the freshman building um and I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad\nIt sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction wow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people on\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was laughing there were terrified people reading and I just I could not in all consciousness leave them leave and be like that\nActually wasn't only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice that I'm\n\nIn her classroom lifted that are attendant sheet out of her emergency folder\nBut small enough to sit in a supply of caught in the month of told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was hot and dark except didn't faces look by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department because for friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the search for the freshman building she ... she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there's a shooter in my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend Sara says drill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet thank God and I didn't hear from her for a while\nAnd our one by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like illuminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open but it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could share movement in around and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this was a police anyone in here\nAnd then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police have anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because [noise]\nSomeone said it's just it's a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time I set it on like afterward I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't power that and training\nVery slowly at the hands all and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to get about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shooters saying they were caught and so I just\nVery slowly ... than you pulled on the handle pushed it up and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started you know giving up construction come out with your hands up\n\nWhat they're told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEven did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy hold her door open until she was like locked eyes with [noise] you know the shooter and and yelled to you know not being able to close the door and crabs\nTo the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway they see the teacher who are most grade she survived [noise] got Beagle in the room next to this day seized at the same things they see did\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway do\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we can talk about them are still that historically rare but now militant actually has been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a\nPlaybook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class [noise] now I moved out to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of the ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with God's in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it\nDoes actually have save lives but not shooting [noise] I really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids survive because of it what might have worked better Cheryl Johnston research is what's effective in these drills at Xavier University and the training instructor for ... one of two big companies in the U. S. that trade schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnston didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also ... all the codes their colors and meanings\nCan some by talked to said notice to I'm a big advocate for not using code at all I\nIf I say could read your takes a split second for your brain to go ... shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there is a gunman in the pool [noise] keeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet [noise]\nBut the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk\nWays to respond to a shooting [noise] sometimes you stay in your room [noise] sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more access like a cafeteria gym [noise]\nAs a last resort if I basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise] I told her to ask her how she didn't or doorway grabbing of dozens of scared didn't remember the brave from our schools protocol\nCheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet\nI wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling in ... the problem with that\nAnd unless you're there you don't know [noise] you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gun me being in a different building yes one thing that was part of the training at Douglas fir barricade in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door\nBut most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did it was actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away it would've been way harder to ... the kids into her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first [noise]\nFewer kids would have made it and [noise]\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school my daughter's nine fourth grade [noise]\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school squatting hide but when I asked her what the drillers for she said I don't know exactly and say [noise]\nI keep thinking about that one shooting the red like Indian reservation shooting and how that one o'clock German students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practice\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me that Israel did not help them at all [noise]\nThat have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills in school period to traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instruction [noise]\nI don't agree with no drills at all [noise]\nBut my daughter to know everything\nI wanted to know about barricade [noise] and I want her to know about renting in fighting back\nI Want her to know about active shooters because the thing to reckon with [noise]\nI Want her to know there's nothing that\nCan keep her completely safe [noise]\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom into my daughter could read a lot so many say listen I see the person with a gun in our school\nOf course I never want someone to say that at all [noise]\n[noise]\nYou know before I was going on in the world\nTaking drugs and way is not going to change that distressed by choice\nOne later this year to build those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in the second amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of gun ammunition and factories like bump stocks I personally by\nHarvard Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support\nBut it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement of conspiracy theorist believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict that\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed\nAlex Jones of course is famous for saying that mass shootings are big he's now a defendant in several destination lawsuit when the Philips who ran into him face to face and a gun control that he accused him of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life in your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and other than I'm listening to him just going you are still absolutely crazy\nLoni got into it with Jones stood right in front of him it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy's stopped dead broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNoticed truth there's or ... troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting is can get dangerous after that Philips his son gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats that had to get\nThe FBI involved demanding was threatening and ended up in jail cell hoaxes or one of the things that Philips informed parents about they tell families to brace themselves\n[noise]\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again cancer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie wasn't college at the time\nShe got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse's prime called Sandy from the theater the minute I picked up the phone\nThere was [noise] screaming child [noise]\nHe said um there's been a shooting what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nJust with the coincident Jesse ... food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but she's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went\nAnd why isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I trashed\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so low it was so horrific and something I never heard before\nMoney found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people were injured\nAnd then five months later there was another mass shooting\nOr twenty first graders insects educators died [noise]\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the opposite\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shooting and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nTiny so they didn't even have to think about it they need at least said yeah because we wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after ... died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown than he said they\nFelt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their faces [noise]\nHe said that's what we look like five months ago\nWhich was that looked like [noise]\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving but they're not really there\nI realized that's when I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nWanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back and he said that was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to confront other parents when they were still so raw Philips inside there was also a strong an instance\n[noise] parents from Virginia attack in Tucson these parents about kids suddenly by many places where they thought that they were safe to fill up to now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moments that launched the filter into what's become their life's work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child died when the mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to [noise] to help them find each other money and he has set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their three\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state [noise] however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend [noise]\nThey want you to move on what they want you to get back to normal might mon brothers should be should string of shame as you were shouldn't you know let me explain something you're right I'm not the same person I never will be they see it as we're obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it [noise]\nThe Philips has been a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away [noise]\nPeople who were closest to disappear\nWhich makes this informal support groups even more crucial [noise] without support looks like over time what it means to the parents to get it I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting in Parkland\nAnd let them at their house [noise] there's something was neck he was the captain of Parkland swim team was about to go to the University in Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors and Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops and it said they just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together\nToday the shooting Mitch an article that phone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nick with okay one person that they heard he's been moved to a staging area\nFor all the students who witnessed the shooting and others at a police officer with giving him a ride home and then a nurse at a local hospital that she thought patient to mash next description but by that evening the door at still hadn't heard directly from neck they went to in there at that law enforcement designated as a meeting area\nIs that in the ballroom and other parents can read it\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped in thinking that calling from somebody else's phone [noise] um [noise] the media was calling you do you have any comment can we have to find your\nIn the morning they see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into a room at a time and the airstrikes strange from nature and\nThen their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like ... when he couldn't even find yourself and you know and I thought that she was arrested and I'm taking keep I'm thinking maybe walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to her house\nAnd then they told us the news that he was gone he was shocked and he was never brought to the hospital\nTo second nightmare\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly\nAnd the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a could want it to look at it injuries Mitch did not on August says this is just how her brain works she's an ER nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her\nCalled the medical examiner's office to ask about neck\nAnd the person that answer the phone and said oh I'm let me let me take a look what's the name again is Nicholas right is a swimmer swimmer is perfect [noise] I think it meant that there was nothing on his face or his head like he was able to perfect\nHe'd been shot three times a bullet in his tax destroyed his heart and lungs through to see him yes\nHe let helpful because your\nPicture in your head when you hear when you hear that somebody has been shocked but an air of Fifteen just so gross I'm so horrible horrible\nAnd I think to see him into the on his body where his injuries were were um\nMade me get it like he was so peaceful and he's not in pain and it made me have a better image of him than the one that was playing over in my mind [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ask Me Another", "city": "Pullman", "day": "13"}
