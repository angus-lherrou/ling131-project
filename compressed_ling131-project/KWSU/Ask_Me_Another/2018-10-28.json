Pennsylvania and beyond have gathered in a packed auditorium NPR's Quil Lawrence of outside of the community service now and he's been talking to members of the Pittsburgh community all day will welcome thank you so much for talking to\nThank you it sounds like a huge gathering there today what is it like at this event\nYeah there's a beautiful hall and saw the auditorium and in the backdrop is Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address\nUm I just stepped away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the\nOf the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nI'm art center maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now they're cheery rain listening to the same service over over speakers\nSounds lovely now um you also spent some time in squirrel held a neighborhood with this attack occurred what was the mood there [noise]\nYeah I mean people were out in scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way to farmers' markets are people going to Sunday services and you can see the diversity of the communities notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of the six president Presbyterian Church a Brittany story and she's in eighth grade English teacher she just friday took her students to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC here's what she said\nI have\nTo wait and patient and now that day I think I'm going to let them read an article in the article I Want to talk of the class and just give them as these [noise] have thought\nAnd what they thought they were really moved by the Holocaust for me [noise]\nAnd people were saying that you know in the little town like this you'd never think can happen but in today's America they realized it can happen anywhere\nAnd and to that point this is a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may have known someone who was the second how are people absorbing the\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I ran into\nHebrew school with the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew a too with the two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal he was a researcher\nSpecials are known for many years whenever I go to a tree of life for a mixture of weddings [noise]\nSome of the treasury to always\nSay where\nHe talked about you know centuries of anti Semitism but more recently and the object of hate speech in this country [noise]\nAnd now finally Quil what what is next what what are people saying that next\nI felt like people were in the sorrow this sort of cycle of sorrow and then tried in the solidarity of the community showing and then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents for\nThe community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they said talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about upcoming elections in and wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence thank you\nThank you\nAnd as you just heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this that are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children\nAnd how to talk to them about tragedies like this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us from the studios Sarah thanks so much for coming back and doing best sort of thing and I understand that you actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's minds\nAnd fortunately have covered several every now and my career as a journalist and you know anytime there's a senseless act of violence that's especially these mass shootings and it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community effected\nI it's impossible for kids not to hear about it right in the new lives and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in a tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things\nAnd not terrified that do you do we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue neighborhood outside the synagogue you also in other places tell us about that yeah I actually went over to the children's museum here in Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great one actually and\nUh they have opened it up to the public for free this week Monday through friday or they want a place for families to go and feel safe and comfortable they say\nAnd today was a pretty normal busy\nMet a woman named Jesse live and she was hanging out with her family and she said something I've been hearing repeatedly and talking to people in Pittsburgh today\nJust that you hear it happening everywhere but you never really think it's happening here\nShe says she's not sure how to broach the subject with her two kids ages for insects\nWe're from Canada though we just\nWe don't see these things that happened up there it was very new living here for like years start seeing it more slowly\nAcross the room Alisa Hoffman was also unsure what to tell her two kids ages six and three about what they're seeing in the news\nIt's hard to [noise]\nI put it into a contract where they understand\nYou know so we haven't really talked about it yeah I have to think\nPop and grew up in the Pittsburgh area and with back here to visit family and like so many here she has ties to finish\nFriends had by environments that tree of life I\nAttendant Sunday school because my best friend growing up was Jewish and that's where she went so it's just really [noise]\nSetting disappointing that that\nPeople get these thoughts and their hats and and do it [noise]\nYou know and I think that they [noise]\nNot that they can't but they actually\nDevon ... runs the make shop a play and craft area for the kids she says the museum staff has been grappling with how to help children and their parents during this scary time\nToday it's hard to be at work\nI Know that we are the helpers here and we are the ones offering support for those families and children while we are also struggling with feeling\nThe way that I'm looking at it is\nYou know we are part of a community together\nAll and I'm\nWith the community right now the old uh important and powerful for me to still says today's plan originally focused on Halloween\nBut after the shooting she switched things up and encourage the kids to build models that houses and buildings and other familiar places they care about places that make Pittsburgh home Sarah McCammon NPR News Pittsburgh\nSo thank you for that and finally today I reached out to an old friend to give us one more perspective on yesterday's shooting they've a trip and we used to work
