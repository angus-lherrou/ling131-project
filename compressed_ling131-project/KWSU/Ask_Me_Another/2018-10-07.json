Indonesia\nThe state department said last week that it will no longer issue visas\nUnless the partners are legally married before the end of the year a spokesperson from the state department said that the policy quote\nInsurance consistent treatment between opposite sex partners and same sex partners unquote that critics point out that many of the families affected by the policy come from countries where same sex marriage is not an option\nAnd these critics argue that if those couples choose to get married in the United states they could faced persecution back home but if they do not married some partners could face deportation James Wiley Bruce ... is a former U.S ambassador to the Dominican Republic under President Obama and he has been speaking out\nAbout this so we called him and ... thank you so much for talking with us thank you for having me and one of the reasons we called you is that you had had first hand experience with navigating accreditation policy you are married to your husband and you served as ambassador in the Dominican Republic where same sex marriage is not recognized how did you navigate that\nSo as we were going my husband had to go as a family member not as a spouse we were able to change his status\nTo be a member of household but we never saw him known as a spouse or as a spouse as other married diplomats have on on their schedule is\nOur main objective was to make sure that he had the fool immunities though that a spouse has and we were able to get that but he was never recognized completely as other spouses were and there was much discrimination based on that\nGet can you just give me an example of that\nSure I mean the first thing that happened to us when we first arrived was that the people ... who is the diplomatic representative of\nThe Vatican informed me that my husband because he was not recognized officially as a spouse or would not be invited to the reception or the diplomatic corps which he was leading\nFor the greeting of the president in the first flight of the Dominican Republic because of that non recognition as a spouse or and so that was just one of many examples where we had to fight to make sure that to my husband was given the same privileges when it came to social aspects as well as legal aspects of\nThis new position by the state department is a reversal of policy that had been in place since two thousand nine under secretary of State Hillary Clinton the state department allowed same sex domestic partners to qualify\nFor dependent these is not the Trump Administration says and as I said earlier that this has to put same sex couples on the same footing as couples that comprise two different genders how do you respond to that\nWell I say it's one of two things one it's either they're an apt and really understanding the logistics of what happens to gay couples and the challenges they have\nThroughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different this is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have an over filled situation\nYou know there were eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage but you're you're not allowing that person who is a great representative for the United nations or another international organization\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of the family the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president's say there's many countries were denying these is from\nThe other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa so it creates a hardship and so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guarantee that they're going to get these are the only way they would be guaranteed is if they go through somehow inferior out how to get married and I know their country and whether that is even something that's an option\nThat James Wiley Brewster he wasn't bathroom to the Dominican Republic from two thousand Thirteen to two thousand seventeenth he's currently a principal at the consulting firm insignia global

news again after former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week in connection with the killing of a teenager at local McDonalds\nBut regional Vince have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot in Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers parents carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nThe violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of his country's most dangerous jobs we wanted to hear more about this so we've contacted Maria had her ... she is a professor police science at John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much\nThing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there's been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it's not so much the number switch\nStatistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent significant us at the present but then when you look at the numbers are we talking about four to something off he says versus other something officer\nSo from my perspective it's suddenly what drives they'll send a wide this police officers were killed in the line of duty\nYou know we don't know exactly what Dr phil fan there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know whether it's some turn that we are saying that is dangerous and disturbing\nI Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so it's just kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier [noise]\nNot necessarily it just to be that most police officers were killed in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case\nIf you look at the most recent years we're looking more at the embassy is a police officer in meditation and we're looking at an investigative activity um whether I handling you know persons with mental illness so it's not the traffic violations and on traffic stops I'm no longer but it's the most frequent reasons I'm for this\nI mean you're saying that they're premeditated by what kind of of ... as it as it were\nA lot of people who for simple police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out though to oppress the police are biased they're racist and and um we sent it seems the last two years\nIn general how the climate on in the last few years the onset policing and so when when you put the two together the propensity towards violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus a triggering event\nThen you have to cut us off the outcome so if somebody's looking at stake yesterday events and in the sea and the steps of a Supreme Court [noise]\nYou'd think police offsets pushing that demonstrate so somebody looking at police officers identify them as part of this ... this part of the GOP\nBecause you cannot take your and get out to be on a given police station instead you you're doing it against the Soviet preventative for the government with the police so\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens in the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians often the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with us\n... when we're looking at both on the investigative enforcement um deaths and the ones that are part of the ... the activities is definitely a training issue office so frequently\nA seat in the car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that ah\nIt's always a reasonable thing to do given that particular environment you benefit and political development that might be putting their life in danger so this issue is how you approach and the problem and how you go to house a well you know though is the fact that queens armed and dangerous\nI mean we have Eighteen thousand police agencies and when you have a ten thousand police agency you cannot Institute stun gun for recruitment stand up for training which would help I mean again the negative perception of of policing the profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there is also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable\nThat nine officers in one year aren't killed in a line of duty of an outcome most premeditated took to because it was directed against them explicitly no democratic society should accept a nine police officers in one year in separate incidents killed by members of the ... can accept\nThat as Maria have
