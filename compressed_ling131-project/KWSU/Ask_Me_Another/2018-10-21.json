N. F. or the intermediate range nuclear forces agreement\nThen President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed a treaty in Nineteen eighty seven it bans are short and medium range nuclear and non nuclear missiles NPR Shannon ... has the latest\nUs says Russia violate the treaty through developing a medium range missiles that is able to have NATO member countries at short notice defense secretary James Mattis has described Russia's breach of the agreement as untenable Kingston reef the director for disarmament research at the arms control association and ...\nOf that type of mental and revive Cold War tensions\nAll constraints on the production of feel they have that missile have gone away thereby increasing the threat to our allies particularly in Europe in range of those missiles\nMilitary competition with China was another reason for the U.S withdraw China was never a signatory to the Nineteen eighty seven treaty which means that can develop medium range missiles without constraint\nHunch Christians and is the director of the nuclear information project at the federation of American scientists which promotes international transparency and nuclear disarmament\nChina has undertaken abroad modernization of its military forces and as part of the modernization has increased its own inventory of weapons to fall into the on average\nReached at the end of ins may portend us withdraw from another agreement the new strategic arms reduction treaty or new start which limits nuclear warheads on deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles for each country\nThe apparent breakdown of the agreement and the uncertain future of another bilateral U.S Russia arms control treaty the twenty ten new strategic arms reduction treaty or new start create the most serious nuclear arms control crisis we've seen in some time\nChristian sense says withdraw from both treaties with sperm military competition globally\nYou'd be the first time essentially since the Nineteen seventies which would be no nuclear arms control agreements regulating the nuclear powers of the world and so the door would be wide open for potentially a new arms race between these countries\nThe last time the U.S withdrew from a major arms treaty was in two thousand two when President George W.

difficult and for some people and traumatic subject that's been much in the news we're talking here about sexual abuse we're finally starting to hear from women and some men who've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witness sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\nDon ... was in high school when he attended a party\nAnd he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the Next Fifty years palm Marines says he didn't do anything about it but the guilt stayed with him and after talking to his wife and sons about it he decided to write about it for the Washington Post\nAnd dumped Palmer is with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr primary thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christie blossoming Ford testify about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that is what motivated me I watched her testimony and I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus uh the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot\nYou know so I said well I'm going to just write something that my experience which was very similar\nI get something bad I said in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote it's hard to read and you know for some people it's gonna be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right yeah\nLet me start by saying this was an unusual event for me because I never went to parties\nNever so I I don't even know why I went I I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kid came upstairs and said hey go outside and look through the basement window to about ten of us were not there and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a\nA girl just lying on a sofa she looked like he was passed out and so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off many he he took her panties off\nAnd then he he pulled on his pants\nAnd he went on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on us\nSide we all just started to run\nYou also write that you and other boys at the party started touching another young woman who was also passed out on the on a bad but then you you left\nYet this was later maybe twenty minutes and thirty minutes later a\nWas laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was when the lights were out everybody was touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nYou know you wrote about why you think the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed in shame they would have been told the chips\nFall [noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nA you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and fought later on it was just just plain guilty you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article ah you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece that I think struck a lot of us was that you said I wanted to tell this story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates that we've all seen things we've all heard other men talk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard\nPeople say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long I\nDon't know I I don't know why we've kept quiet\nI had a quote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault and uh I I Can't answer I don't I don't know I I I really don't know why men have been silent\nOn this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward and uh talk about what we've seen what we've done I think that should be part of it [noise]\nHow did your family take it when you told them\n[noise] well [laughter] let let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her just the rate part that I witnessed I did not tell her my\nParticipation she didn't know that until this article came out ... let me just [laughter] it's\nAnd how did you explain that to your boy well\nJust I was truthful with him and uh\nThey were very receptive on their dad you know that can you know we we kinda can't do too much wrong in the in the eyes of our kids are they both told me that my two older boys they don't think it would happen now and they said everybody at that window would have had their phones al\nVideotaping it that's what they told me\nBut that doesn't mean it wouldn't have had what are they saying they yeah I mean but\nIn that sense that she wouldn't have done it because he wouldn't have wanted to be on film you say well we film everything you know what they would kinda alluding to\nWell how do you feel now that you've got an off your chest you know\nKind of have mixed feelings I'll be honest here or there are days when I regret it and then there are days that\nI'm Glad I did you know my kids showed me some comments on Twitter from people some women have said it's about time some of it it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit that\nA lot of women are said uh they were glad I did it they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a\nAssaulted who wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good you\nKnow your piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could call it but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say the only thing I can\nSay is I'm Sorry I didn't help\nAh you know few women had called me a hero but no I wasn't I Would have been a hero if either help these women then but I didn't do it Don hammering thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nIn recent years have been many disturbing stories involving male athletes and the women in their lives so it may be hard to remember just how shocking it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine when Carolina Panthers wide receiver rake Ruth was charged with orchestrating the murder of his pregnant girlfriend ...

Watkins was the hit man that truth hired to commit the murder or you know drive by shootings sort of situation\nAnd truth yes I have spoken to them on the phone for about twenty minutes but off the record so it helped inform my reporting some but\nIt was ultimately his attorney who who I'm most recently spoke to for the the pod cast that's exactly what he says it was violent retribution ... what can be an angry accrued for this drug deal that group had agreed to finance\n[noise] I'm released gave only with these headlines Saudi Arabia has confirmed the death of Washington Post columnist
