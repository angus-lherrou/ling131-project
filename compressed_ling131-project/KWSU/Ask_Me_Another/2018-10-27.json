might have like another adult\nAnd I was I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember used to have found that those because I think it

she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story kind of Michael Bay like stories from this American Life now for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it onto the radio for this week's show however we had her put together another story using that same style\nWhich we added music to here at the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nIt's a story about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nUniversity it's a pretty straight place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tankers [noise]\nIt's not the sort of place you'd expect people to watch your guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt

[laughter] you know I don't know [noise]\nGot asked his college friend told us to act this giant meant like\nBig rats impromptu before heading up to the plot\nA blanket wrapped around their middle to high told us\nAnd black really way like the guy I think\nWe have a point the bushes photo died at I um [noise]\nBecause I really couldn't see what was going on out of the caught until the time came and I got on the shoulder effects way of like around my waist and we walked out and I remember just being maybe you know maybe ten people for people and I remember them being way on the other side and sort of running and it worked so ridiculous about it was\nThe other is like a handful of people and they were so spread out but they're all coming to work for it right like you know what the hell am I
