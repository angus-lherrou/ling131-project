challenge NPR's Joel Rose has been there reporting for the last couple of days Joel what have you seen\nI've seen long lines for gas for food for water um for all sorts of basic supplies are as people are are trying to come back into their homes in and clean up after the storm but you know long lines is an improvement because earlier in the ...\nYou know we are seeing an emergency response really start to step up and get to these things out to people but it's it you know it remains a challenge to find some to get supplies into some of the hardest hit areas\nI'm In the suburbs to the east to Panama City and also up into rural inland communities that were hit really hard by the storm I'm entering a little more difficult to reach so uh you know the emergency response is getting underway but I'm sure if it's going to be awhile before it reaches everybody who is affected\nAnd communication is still really tap in places where phone service is down the Internet's down how has that affected rescue effort I\nThink it has been a real problem I mean cell phone service those non existent for days after the storm and it's still really spotty I'm In Panama City in the surrounding county\nAnd it's difficult because people can't coordinate the emergency response it's hard to\nTell people where to go if you can't communicate with them and it it's also making it really difficult for people to call their family members and check in and say hey I you know I'm OK I'm here you know I Need this or that kind of supply or even just I'm Alive you know I mean emergency crews are going door to door to try to\nFigure out who survive the storm and who didn't and and I have to think it would be a lot\nIt it must be slowing this effort down for them not to be able to communicate with people by cell

considering that you know devastation to the electrical infrastructure all over Panama City in the suburbs I mean there are electric posed down everywhere\nAnd lines in the street you can't drive anywhere without driving over electric lines\nAnd uh you know so it's a giant maps and if they could have power back to much of the county and two weeks that you know that would be great\n[laughter]

WBUR you are in Boston hey Terry Hi first what are the arguments being made in the case\nWill students for fair admissions that a group that filed this lawsuit will be trying to prove essentially for things in this case first they say that Harvard illegally use as a quota system or racial balancing an admissions\nThey say the admissions rates for each demographic river or two similar from year to year a second the group is arguing that Harvard admissions is considering race too much or that it's the deciding factor and not just a factor of a factor like affirmative action policy actually allowed\nThe group also thinks that Harvard has an adequately explored admissions methods that don't use race they say that you really can still get a diverse class by considering things like geography and socioeconomic status\nBut as you mentioned the biggest delegation here is that Harvard is intentionally discriminating against Asian Americans in this application process\nAnd there'll be trying to prove this with a lot of statistical analysis actually but it basically boils down to an argument where\nThey'll try to show that while Asian American applicants do have the highest academic qualifications or GPA standardized test scores things like that and that they consistently or an lower personal scores from the admissions department\nAnd a a personal score is a number of the Harvard assigns applicants to to write things like personal essays letters of recommendation and even the amount of personal hardship that someone face but the person\nBehind this lawsuit is an Asian American raid his name is Edward Blum can you tell us more about him\nThat is true yes Edward Blum is the president of students for fair admissions and that is the group but technically brought this last\nHigher education he's also spearheaded the lawsuit behind Fisher versus the University of Texas which he ultimately lost as you remember in the Supreme Court in twenty sixteen now we did reach out to bloom for an interview a before trial but he declined\nWe did speak with someone who is close to him Ilya Shapiro who he's a he's a constitutional fellow at the Kato Institute He explained blooms perspective to me this way\nAs a as a society where we're ready to doesn't matter where government treats us all the same regardless of skeptical archer Asian American applicants and students are for her because most strictly straight out of the problems\nWhat is Harvard have to say\nWell Harvard in standing behind their admissions policies and they say they don't have a quota pointing to the fact that in the last five years they have admitted about twenty nine percent more Asian applicants\nHarvard's legal team will also be presenting data that refused the plaintiffs analysis over those lower personal scores\nAnd W. B. U. R. spoke with Harvard new president Larry back out over the summer I felt this lawsuit and well he couldn't comment on a specific he did say that diversity is important to the school and that a lot of factors are considered in the submissions process\nThings Carrie thank you carry young is the senior education reporter for member station WBFO you are in Boston\nThe twenty Eighteen McArthur genius grants were awarded last week and we've been spending some time on the program with a few of the recipients today we'll hear from poet Natalie B.
