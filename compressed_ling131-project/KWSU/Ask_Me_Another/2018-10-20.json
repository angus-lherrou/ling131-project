for half a story that is so small it almost\nWrong to tell it in a room there\nI got turned go for eight minutes about half of our living singing the other half she makes a recording audio books about a year ago she was staying in a hotel\nAnd she had a deadline on his children's books that she was supposed to be recording and hotel room was kind of noise is using a lot of noise from the street and digital drop a quiet places you went into the closet put pillows all around to get the sound sound before with microphone and then the court at the microphone\nAh went under the door of the closet out to her laptop because her laptop had a fan made no ads as you close the door\nSuch pitch dark\nExcept for the light from her eye pad which had the text of the book that she was supposed to read\nBe exciting exploit an ... written by Tricia sugar rack and married it by kind give free chapter one way or in the enchanted forest deep\nAnd green splashed with President would it be incredible if I just now play do the entire audio book [noise]\nHe paid like eighty five bucks for this is [noise]\nActually I Can't tell you the whole idea of what's a car and gets exactly like two and half sentences into this book and she stumbled on words he said oh wait I'll just I'll just start again at the start from the beginning so she gets up\nTo go to the closet and start the tape began started recording again and ah she tried to get out cause it [noise]\n\nIt's just garbage that she's locked in for [noise]\nOh my God [noise]\nThe guy told me at first she thought like this isn't going to be that hard right after all she has the eye pad\nHis wife I should call the front desk on Skype bread and there was a problem\nThat's why I was like half of one bar and it kept just cutting out but I found the hotel number\nBits of course is on the recording one to six one nine six zero zero [noise] down [noise]\n\nThank you for calling them I don't know how to give up all the options\nFor national information about the help out our Web site\nAnd then of course like the longest hotel phone on menus ever\nWhat did you meet the press\nAnd like trying to pressure the road to get to the operator and I'm thinking the wife I was going to cut out at any moment so I'm listening to like this giant long menu and finally I hear\nIt anytime we need to an operator from [noise] [noise]\nHi I'm actually in room eleven\nCan you hear me can you hear me [noise]\nAfter that the seven minutes of silence when the recording just like total silence nothing happens except [noise] every now and then turn just laughed to herself\n[noise]\nOne minute and forty seconds after the phone call then it's quiet there's no other sounds for forty four seconds and then on the recording\nYou're here [laughter] [noise]\nNow and then she tried the door handles again thinking she told me later you know just can't really be true like cat it's got to be with us going to work [noise]\nOne well because it had the hallway on the other side and Eighteen minutes after car and locked up in she hears people\nShe hears some German tourists\nWalking towards her down the hall unfortunately\nShe actually has the skills for this very situation [noise] [noise]\n\nGermans come to the door of the room they whisper to each other for a little bit\nAnd then they do nothing [noise]\n\nHer husband's out on a dish and he's also a singer and his phone was turned off she takes her mom there's nothing bad\nShe found her mom and ready then somebody taps on the door the hotel room and caused where are you okay [noise]\nCan you come to the door the person asks [noise]\nCurrent does is really weird thing to say to somebody as you're getting less\nCouldn't help herself nobody wants to look like I'm not you know [noise]\nApparently the Germans when they found is\nVery sweet Jamaican housekeeper and twenty two minutes after cameras locked in the house keeper praise God I was so happy to see her\nAnd she was how nice oh my gosh she was so nice\nI notice is a weird question but like is it appropriate to tip in a situation like that [noise]\nI don't know I didn't think of it than\nMy parents remember is she's just an opera singer right an opera is all about the spectacle you not to eighty people from the stage and horses and vengeance and being grand feeling it was really it would really be hard to get further from that\nTo what happened to her in that closet right all the action takes place in a space not much bigger than your body it is the simplest pot imaginable there's literally no movement in this plot\nIt's among which is stage this as an opera\nGo [laughter] [noise] um\nIt might mean minimal and music actually a right\nLike just repeating beam over and over and over again with me yelling help\n\nAnd if people say those kinds of things in interviews and then I'll put that quote at the end of the story and make sure that sending put a little pinky music under it and [noise] have you heard our show [noise]\nBut when we did this interview like\nThree or four weeks ago I wrote a windows and every once in my life I don't have to let the story stop here I Am actually going to be an opera house very soon I can retire with this I can take this to the next logical step by step it never gets you to step you need an opera house for [noise]\nAnd it turns out I actually have a hook up for the kind of music that current is talking about\nSome of the other side because of his name is still the glass [noise]\nWritten\nA number of minimalist operas [noise]\nThey've been performed here and there's very state since the Nineteen eighties I stand on the beach just this past\nFall and so I caught Phillip and he sat down to write and so today right now I'm pleased to present here in
