I take care of the babies that are in ICU um after they're born to them you know I see [noise]\n\nNewborn babies are not born addicted that is that common misnomer but addiction is a complex and complicated disease it has multiple\nFacets to it they're babies are not born addict and they're not drug babies their infants that were exposed to a substance in utero\nThat exposure is a long enough lead to a dependency and because they became dependent on that stuff done\nOnce they are born and they no longer have that substance being provided they become at risk of going through withdrawal and what part of um withdrawal symptoms to be so babies have the same withdrawal symptoms as adult they have symptoms that affect their GI systems vomiting diarrhea\n... volume off they have\nRespiratory symptoms are they breathe fast they had difficulty breathing retractions and grunting and what we call to kidney I which is just fast breathing\nThey also have temperature instability these kids tend to run hot but the categories that we worry about are the ones that are going to compromise their wellbeing those babies are in control of oil and crying that is babies don't handle that\nYou and I can cry for hours and days and we'll be fine babies can't cry for hours because as they cry for hours they become physically exhausted and that leads them to actually start having symptoms of really being sick\nBabies typically when they're born sleep twenty plus hours but these little ones that go through withdrawal\nPlayed any of us will get sick the babies that happens within hours today's instead of a week and what kind of try and have you seen 'em in the last few years um has it gone down up they certainly in the same I mean we know that nationally we know the numbers are significantly increase anyway we've had at\nSeven hundred percent increase in such for the fact that in the sense in the past decade\nIn Kentucky or national nationally and at the trends in Kentucky uh probably leading to\nHold your baby [noise] um she's one week all today [noise]\nShe had some\nProblem she breathed in some of the flood when she was coming out and she has to lead on her lungs so

I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think about our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context if you look in the Eighteen hundreds for example the early Eighteen hundreds that was a time of the birth rate in the Arab states with about seven per woman it was an extraordinarily prolific birth rate compared to today\nAnd that really made the context very different because immigration was not a huge ally important part of population change in the United states and Europe if you look at later you're us this was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite\nFor low skilled workers who could fuels the growth of the manufacturing sector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new body is if you look at a post industrial knowledge intense\nStratification that entail new social programs and that also mean that we have different pressures and challenges when it comes to integrating folks who come from very low income very deprived background\nSo I think that when you think about the story of American immigration it's important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving in response to larger global economic changes\nRe hon front on editor of the national review conservative magazine in the U. S.\nCurbing immigration as he suggests would spell the end of the classic American ours has suffered the panelists immigrant who arrived as he can you live on through hard work and determination goes on to prosper and thrive\nSo would that be a dramatic change to America's history of immigration off to the United states often described as homes the largest immigrant population in the world [noise]\nIt's a question I put to a chump ski she's professor of history at Salem State University in Massachusetts\nIf you look at the history of immigration and how immigrants have been treated in the United states you see a big change happening after the civil war prior to the civil war citizenship was restricted to white people in the United states it was a racial citizenship\nAnd in the grants were welcome to that is white people were welcome to there were no restrictions on immigration at all\nBut the restrictions were placed on citizenship and there was in fact the importation of a huge non white working class people from Africa who were enslaved and brought here\nWho did the manual labor the agricultural labor but they were not eligible for citizenship\nAnd they were not considered immigrants so when we say this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narrative and it's connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens and people of color are workers to be exploited and not eligible to citizenship\nNow after the civil war African Americans are granted citizenship\nCitizenship by birth is created\nAnd this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely racialized the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from becoming citizens so we have huge categories of people defined as racially ineligible to citizenship\nAnd they are not allowed to immigrate in order to prevent them from gaining citizenship by birth\nThat would imply that the American dream is a myth\nA very racialized myth that is it's been a dream for white image\nSo in that sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than what happened previously\nNo it's not and I think that we make a mistake when we talk about the idea of the American dream in the midst of upward mobility\nThat this is something that when we look over the nineteenth of twentieth century\nHas applied to primarily to European\nImmigrants we look at the period of the late Nineteen to the early twentieth century of large European immigration where there's the posted American Dream was created this was not a period of the American dream for Mexican immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for Chinese immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for immigrants from Africa now people of\nColor have also accepted this mythology that in the idea that the United states as a country of opportunity\nThe American dream but if you look at how the economy functions today it is still heavily reliant on the exploited labor of people of color the immigrants who are coming into the country today\nIt's a bifurcated immigration that is there is a very elite immigration of highly educated uh people in technology but the majority of immigrants do not fall into that category the majority of immigrants are poor low educational level\nAnd they are filling a very important role in the U.S service economy there are jobs for them\nBut there's not upward mobility for them\nOf being a theory in American immigration history when the opportunities for say an Asian or African or a Latin American immigrant with the same as as for European no there haven't even more recent on\nThat doesn't mean that there has never been an Asian or Latin American or African immigrants who have succeeded in gaining upward mobility and I'm becoming very successful in the United states but if you look at it statistically does populations have been permanently marginal\nI play that you're on a different and the political spectrum to\nAround ... the editor of the national review who had from the other what do you make of his argument that in order to safeguard democracy in America at the moment to allow the current population to adapt to changing economy will needed is a cook on immigration\nBecause what is happening in the economy in America is\nChanging into one that's founded on knowledge I'm stunned subjects rather than a Monday flattering well\nDan knowledge economy requires a huge service economy to service it who is cleaning the house is taking care of the children\nIt's poor people of color who are providing those services\nProfessor of these uh Chomsky at Salem State University and in case you're wondering yes she is the director of the famous American philosopher
