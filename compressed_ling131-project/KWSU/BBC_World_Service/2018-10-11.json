than they used to really I mean the cost of fuel as a proportion of a an eleven month SpaceX rocket kind of shoot him spaces is actually only a tiny fraction of the cost of the overall mission so it's a few really good deliverable everyone is waiting for\nAbsolutely what we will find over time is very cheap rockets are going to get extraordinarily efficient at going from the surface of the year
