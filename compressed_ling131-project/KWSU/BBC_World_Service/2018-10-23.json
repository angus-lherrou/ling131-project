I don't always ...\nFuller the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if they have something to say that they want to show in the video and then I have to take that into consideration\nOkay Kenny I'd like to me through now either from page to final products like what are your technique\nSo you know they gave me this song I go back I could listen to a song and meeting at ease matches a picture in my head like I just like to frame and then I just have to redo gather\nAnd sometimes it takes me a long time I got to you know police on when I'm washing my team that Cleveland I'm cooking when I'm trying to keep them why [noise]\nThe thing I'm trying to the way from thinking about the idea and it never watch for me I don't think about the idea initially ...\nCome to me in ways and you know when I'm keeping and that's why we have looked at when I was speaking with a pen I Do get up and I write it all down but then I'm going to get as soon as I get up and I tried to make it as a visual as possible in words and then I found it to them and hundreds of another hundred the article I Love that idea\nReally a hundred percent I don't know I didn't I didn't believe I Do have to think that that's what it is I shouldn't have about it and you know\nAnd then of course I think at some point to the liberal\nThis is what we need to do to my truck that this is what we need to do I because I think we can post it on the business press and\nSecond a lot about me quit the person but we're not pitching while cutting that idea very passionate about it I mean I can teach that I can feel it I Do everything from but when you look to just you know when the ... the entire vision is what you just have to show up in your pocket [laughter]\nLet me let me I'm ... I'm\nGimme talks about the ... of this film in ... she's brushing my teeth when she's thinking line what about you how do you come to to get that vision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that I've definitely listened to some toxin many times where I can listen to them anymore um\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening process until you just can't [noise] you only is it ... you know I mean it's like yeah you don't even have the lyrics anymore you just feel it [noise]\nSometimes it's good to just sit with that you know if you count the problem is sometimes you get a track and I like can you get the treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so\nThat's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market or maybe I'm just not as popular as director Kenny but\nYou know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly\nBut more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors\nSo that's a little tricky because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many imaging who knows\nI recently pitched on the cot is a ... and Jay Z and I knew that there was some big guns in the ... pitching on that project and I knew I was lucky to be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with Don ... schedule I'm not sure that had time to talk to [laughter]\nSo I just have to come up with an idea and like what's the best you know I I didn't quite know at that time but that's the part of being a director and said\nThere is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success show [laughter] but maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artists and you ... it can potentially be more competitive out that because I feel there's a lot of directors out their\nBiggest kills me fishing for me on\nWith some amazing artist but then I think I'm looking by the time to come to me that kind of made up their mind but then again it's not Jay Z Beyonce\nYou are listening to the conversation might get to a rude to any music video direct his ... and Kenny ... from Nigeria so you burn operating at a level where many of the honesty worked for his own huge big names and know exactly what\nThey want to think ... specific examples where you have to navigate\nAccommodating on holding on to create position and\nI knew him he said that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points for somebody when something a little bit differently than it does make you\nYou got to understand initially in the beginning it wasn't that way 'cause I mean I have to put myself especially being a woman in the industry and competing with of course jumps going it's America's male dominated field and met at the end it crossed off starting off\nOn television so I was the printing press than that now want it to be the girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had was every time you get the opportunity you have to knock it out the park\nThe first ever project that I did one official project and I did music video it was a music video for an weren't very many and I was one of them\nAnd they had a a song that was going to be the team gone and they had a lot of the big names pitching for it and I'm like you know what to do it is now like you know I'm a direct analogy but yeah I mean we want you to start when you come out of the stages might not\nAnd I remember just from one thing I had one day I had a dream about the concept tries to be a visual as possible and I sent it to the guy that you know was running the industry\nAnd he called me like I was like I actually love this treatment and bite off your like that I caught that one and I needed to make a decision on who you know what how about you do that\nHow about you don't pay me\nGave me just what I Need to execute this project\nAnd you get a better deal could of course you're gonna have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point that got that chalk eventually to position myself I wasn't having it but I knocked it out the part I might not have gotten more boosted tuition but that is the only project and I have to pitch for it\nBut then one I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a business card to you\nAnd and that's just how it's been okay can we talk about how much you're charging [laughter] I'm very expensive very kinds of you know they say yeah you don't have to give me the exact figure to give me a sense of how much you charging than it sounds on the\nProject that things I charge that things are charging a dip ... they're like on their projects that I use\nFor nothing at all that but I Believe me the money when he came to me my budget with a little bit too much for\nThem I really loved the project I wanted to be parts of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in and put on a project might not have lightened my pocket at that point in time when I was probably made me the most money down the line because people off the bat and gone I needed to work in this project\nRight away okay so now I think it's going to be doing and they can get ... now I mean I can you give me a sense of how much he's challenging\nIt's funny because actually my family has not increased because it does a rule of thumb that older actors get temp set of budget\nIs what would be typical budget I mean can give me an example of the budget recruit him out of hand hundreds allows us donors and we talked about ten thousand US dollars\nIt can be that it can be either um let's say a low budget project is around ten thousand and that means that direct to get a thousand dollars but that would be like a month's work\n... you would get more working at a supermarket [laughter] because as a matter of hours you put into a project where you drop everything and literally just do that you're not making much per hour but if you're working on a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollar project you can you end up with a little bit of caution you pocket\nWhen you see the dynamics tempted from what does that mean ten percent of the total budget so who gets the budget well normally the budget comes from the label\nCan get in your experience how a male and female artistry to different keep a record labels\nAnd well in my experience and is obviously general conversation doesn't apply to everybody of what we find it really depends on the oddest thing like how much they already have to bring to the table\nBut if it's somebody who used to be young and like a little bit lost and not really sure and that hit the talented and have an amazing voice and maybe the songwriting needs a little bit of collaboration with other writers so it it
