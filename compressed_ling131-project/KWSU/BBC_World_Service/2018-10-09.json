help sell products\nBut what exactly is cool and when did it come from\nSome even argue that it's impossible to define though I suspect that my three guests today will try to convince you otherwise

but\nSince it started out as a set of strategies to defy racism I Will choose Muhammad Ali the heavyweight boxer and Ali although universally admired now I'm most white Americans hated Ali when he took them you know as a main and trash talk as a boxer\nSo he grew up watching musicians which was Miles Davis but he knew that cool had to change it to something more confrontational\nAnd so she didn't fight in the Vietnam War and he went to prison for three years at the prime of his career for funding probably ten million dollars and earnings\nAnd he famously said about Vietnam I'm not going

Billie Holiday as um my example of the epitome of cool Billie Holiday was a jazz artists a jazz singer and she has to be seen as a female down to you so this idea of where a woman\nRaces maternity an expression is that in all aspects of their lives and used his clothes and the way they style themselves to help the articulation of identity and what that means for them\nOkay sit on a a female like Conan giants today it was about ...\n... in film you know why are women were often cooler than men and women refuse a docile and subservient role they pursue their own desires often ruthlessly\nAh they can be interpreted as part of the backlash against women who went to work and traditionally male factory jobs such as welding during World War two\nThe film to why some fatalities depicted as dangerous evil ... seemed mostly in the dark shadows at night\n[noise] okay so what do you think about this idea that maybe the weather that comes with who seem to be mostly men\nOr if you're talking about jazz musicians are Fillmore actors this notion of being sort of a rebel loner that tough and stoic and stylish and brave and your art and style this was not really associated with women for quite awhile first time I saw a woman\nReferred to a school in a headline or the description of her personality and charisma was actually a Kim Gordon who is a basis from the ban found a huge from the eighties or nineties\nAnd since twenty Thirteen I see it applied regularly to the women who won merged in the seventies and rock and roll Patti Smith Deborah Harry Chrissie Hi and\nAnd uh so I'm just saying that of course there've always been cool women but the term cool and never really been associate with them until recently the newest rebel persona I specially in music for example are all women and so to some extent\nIf that concept is going to continue to be a vital concept it's going to have to be defined and read directed by women\nWell in a moment we will be taking a closer look\nI'm from the b._b._c. while ... straight off to the news summary\nDistribution or the b._b._c. would serve assuming the U.S has made possible by American public media with support from see three I O T

committed to offering a streamlined shopping experience were home an auto can be bundled together now that's progressive learned more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progress [noise]\n\n\n\n\nAnd this was during a time in the United states when being a non conformist was actually dangerous as soon as the period of the house committee on un American activities and the McCarthy hearings and the Senate people were persecuted for their views this was a time of extreme racism segregation persisted in the south\nI'm homophobia massage any\nWere extreme levels and young people who are chafing against all kinds of restrictions um identified wholeheartedly with James Dean and Marlon Brando\nTo to ... from the Nineteen fifty five so rebel without a cause for James Dean was the archetype teenager struggling with his parents\nWe give you love and affection don't we all then what is it was it because we wanted to that party\nWell you know what kind of drunken brawl those kind of artist turn into a place for kids\nTo go you say you didn't care if they drink said ...\n\nYou know you'll say why do they have\nTo wait a minute hey you know he takes us to\nJames Dean Jim Baucus I'm doren I'm Virginia ... in rebel without a crude from Nineteen fifty five directed by Nicholas re according to the film at stake for an entire generation of young Americans as you said but there's also point you had these with a new teenagers very much opposed wool phenomena\nYes in fact the word teenager was relatively new at the time or to some extent it was a luxury to be a teenager at a time when the economy was doing quite well and a young people didn't have to go to work and become just like their parents at a young age so they had a leisure time\nFor perhaps the first time in American history and uh they were also board\nUm this was a time of white flight from the city's after World War two people move to the suburbs um and there wasn't much to do they are so you've had as funny\nOf a rebellious attitude not wanting to be like their parents because they didn't have to\nCount all the time that these films compassion came to be seen as cool too didn't they just want us to act is\nOf course yes and it gave license to teenagers across the world to make use of everyday object to say something new something different about what it meant to be a teenager so the classic of courses teach it to white T shirt place everyday object which started um [noise]\nAs part of a naval uniform in around Nineteen Thirteen but seeing on the body of Marlon Brando in streetcar named desire then warmed by James Dean and rebel without a cause that\nDreaming white T shirt under red jacket so some things so ordinary coupled with a a pair of jeans could taste some things so radical\nOne of the other major shake his from his parents we must have got to embodied thoughts rebel spirit was the thing I Elvis Presley\n\n\n[noise] Joe\nSo where did Elvis fits into the pantheon of cool well Elvis fits in in both directions first of all Elvis worship Marlon Brando and James Dean\nAre actually in the movie could Creole plays a role that was meant for James Dean except that he passed away and when he first ran to Marlon Brando at the commissary on the studio lot\nHe shook his hand and walked away and said oh my God I just shook hands with Marlon Brando so that Elvis was a fat boy from Marlon Brando it's kind of a shock looking back\nUh but the second thing is coming out of African American music Elvis basically gave white Americans permission to love African American music because he was white he grew up in the deep south he grew up with the rhythm and blues and gospel music\nAnd it is important to remember that Elvis's first hits were also hits on the black charts on the rhythm and blues ... he was doing something somewhat a rich you know\nWith the African American rhythm and blues tradition and so although he was often sort of seen as an appropriate or and you could say he is or not but a lot of his African American beers at\nThe time also enjoyed his\nAnd he is rockets and energetic he's in control of his performance but he knows what he's doing any once said that uh every time I get a reaction in the audience to a certain physical gesture I remember it and then I Do it the next time so we have this real knowledge of how pop works\nThe impact to people like James Dean into Elvis Presley and popular culture has of course being huge transmitted as technology has cooled across the globe but I Wonder what you will see how we really talking about American cultural imperialism yeah it's not what cool is in the end Joe\nNo it's sometimes is a certain way it's the power of American culture but\nTen years ago there was a poll thirty thousand people on line of global poll and among the questions were what is the coolest nationality and to my great surprise it was American\nAnd the second question was why and this is the important part for cool the answer was because of the coolest people live there and the people they named where I ... we actually consider cool and so there's a real sort of unconscious\nOr understanding that coal is an essential concept in American culture and in self definition now I'm not by any means saying are apologizing that there is an American cultural imperialism about consumer products and about capitalism that is of course true\nBut I think that there's both and there's a cool that's attributed to capitalism and buying things that are associate with America and then there is that cool is the concept for self definition and rebel cool in America\nCould your what's your view of the American concept is cool inspired young people around the world this is in part because American music in Hollywood films permeate the globe and advertisers aggressively marketed James Dean and Elvis memorabilia\nBut cultural imperialism is not the whole story in fact there's a constant cross fertilization between cultures adolescence internationally creatively reinvent the rebel icon for their own purposes\nAnd for post colonial young people the rebel style could be used a signal their dissatisfaction with the failed promises of of independence from colonialism unemployment poverty racism corrupt governments and oppression persistent both on the former colonies and then the former colonial powers\nThere's a film that to ... post colonial rebels um\nMen friendly ball to get the housing projects on the outskirts of Paris try to figure out how to respond to police violence the air is of African descent ... of Arab descent and vans is Jewish one of their friends has been shot by police during a protest\nAnd they adopt a cool detached style to feel invincible to feel strong and they emulate what they've learned from pop culture that they discover it doesn't protect them\nKind of what you think about besides air crews cultural imperialism [noise]\nFor me it's not just about the kind of a tough thing down if you live but it was that what ... saying is that making use if those references to create something new and to say something new about their own experiences in particular a particular geographical space\nI suppose that's what we've been tracking throughout this prank round the way one style of cool is being taken by another generation and turned it into his friend and I I've been hearing to housing remains static because it comes to that\nJob today everyone wants to be cruel and we're so things on the premise that that cool which seems to run counter to the original rebellious spiritual detachment from the mainstream of conformity that we've been talking about so well cool today there's\nConformity cool marketing cool and there's rebel cool\nAnd the marketing cool is the kind that people promote products and make it seem like you're a rebel if you have one or you'll be popular any of those things\nAnd then there's the grass roots rebel cool and which people and laid out adolescence choose icons that they admire that are rebels that they in a sense vicariously live through or lead them to their own path so\nI Would say in terms of marketing cool cool is a rebel sensibility for consumer culture and that's ironic right so you don't want to conform so you pretend you're a rebel even though you're conforming but for me the rebel cool part the part that still vital one alive\nI Would define rebel cool simply to sway the coolest how when you go she ate maternity in late adolescence two kinds of popular culture between like the age of Seventeen and twenty five and we're looking for self definition and you will find yourself and I kind of cool that guides you there\nAfraid that's where we got time for like you say much for exploring the roots of cool with me Joe dinner scene Carol ... and Claudia Springer\nIt's time for Newsday on the BBC will service welcome from the Lawrence Harmon Sean [noise]\nToday at a

Democrats are likely to retake the house but suddenly the Senate team didn't play that process did change after the cabinet controversy it did fire up Republican voters\nAnd so many people believe

melt down while I was\nHigh and it happened in Los Angeles at a Dodger Stadium which is a baseball stadium and I was actually attending the world series in Los Angeles and I I purchased a ticket\nOnline uh and it turned out to be from a fraudulent third parties seller and I announced this on Facebook and I got a message from some random guy but never met before he said I live near the stadium when to come by my house and we can smoke up 'cause I was a very you know public stoner and everyone wanted to wanted to get high with me right so\nI went and I spoke to his weight and then I had this joint that I bought at a store and it had crystallized THC in on the outside of it it was kind of like smoking marijuana burden to crack so by the time I got to the stadium I was blasted absolutely gone I was just scored\nIt away from the stadium by security and I you know went into the parking lot and I caught a glimpse of myself in a side\nMirror of a car and I didn't like what I saw that yeah that that's interesting people like you who who've always defended marijuana and kind of say it's largely harmless you still believe it should be legalized and yet he while writing an article about how harmful it can be\nSort of seems like a contradiction in your attitudes Neal is fascinating\nWell not really I mean if you think about it marijuana being illegal has hurt millions of lives people have been unjustly imprisoned or selling it for possessing it it's often used as an excuse by police to arrest people on flimsy pretext and it's all it's often used\nBy forces not for good and it's also um there's also the fact\nThat it has salutary medical applications right I mean you know I've I've met\nChildren who have intractable epilepsy and the only thing that's been able to cure them in mass\nHeadaches the only middle calm down their headaches that marijuana you know and there's many other examples of people in extreme pain from cancer taking NASA does the THC instead of or CBD instead of um opioids\nAre but that said I'm not any of those people write I'm a I'm you know regular guy without any particular health problems but I Do have an addictive personality\nAnd marijuana can lead to mental health problems\nPeople are more likely to listen to ... that because of what you deed is kind of you got the phone to find these people go to this the well simply would be the message each each legal enjoy it but I Want\nIt legal enjoy it but be careful if you find that it is affecting your relationships it's affecting your work if your entire life becomes about

H cute it's one of the few solid brick buildings in a slum listening out onto the view of his old neighborhood [noise]\nI grew up in a better\nFuture for a tough life they went through I Lived in poverty I finished gun violence that was abused by people in the street we were very poor\nSort of a tough place\nKenny isn't exaggerating when he said it was tough I just ten years old he ran away from home\nBecause of it there's no food in the house for me to one of the report what did you do it all the stuff I think by grabbing things from people and you could sell them for your cup box somewhere we comment\nTypically beat up and often bitten by the police\nPart of the clinic knee high so that I can forget about her my my pain\nBut then at age fourteen afterlife of poverty and petty crime everything changed after he was befriended by Catholic priests in the neighborhood he started going to school and reading books\nLanded up both Marcus Garvey about two missile Mandela Rosa Parks and they became my mentor but I never met I used to talk to them that couldn't keep\nSo in two thousand and four Kenny created shelf go and it's not a pretty small actually as a football team but it grew and grew he married an American volunteers who came to work on the project which now includes a school for girls youth mentoring scheme and health clinic and it was the clinic that inspired that focus on water\nWe used to tell people what to do things in our clinic [noise]\nSome people get caught up some people get ... guys what do we do someone at the committee had a suggestion idea given

fix it and I'm like wow this is a good idea if I did we just don't believe in the community we just thought they were like well let me think about it to look at the end yeah this is currently idea\nSo what about the cartels by building these area waterways shelf though is moving into that's hurt trait in a big way and ... experience in states in Kibera comes into play it sounds like you've got an enemy the cartels yes are they trying to stop you\nWherever the people I mean it is that's why I guess I think one of them could we now have you had any interaction with them yes I don't mean to me that they started cutting the pipes at Fox when they started cutting you'll pipe yes so that was really terrible so what I did for several of them would really be on to their life or do you have to tend\nTo be the ones that didn't want to look for them to come up with somebody then there's the ideally yeah also why by that is that some times that they sell their water we don't have mostly on the weekends we don't do send water for that that they have the water there\nThis is Kenny old I've ah he has a running with the cartels but instead of ending up in a battle he finds a way to negotiate his way out of the problem\nIt's clean cheaper and cheap compared to what they must be worried about your friends yeah yeah so I I Will to find a way to work with them where to find a way without too don't put the impact of the system [noise] food that's your what's your ...\n[noise]\n\n\nListening to Kenny how his life story the Sam [noise] makes me realize that he really is the key to this\nHere and we sell all within our program it's about the strong willed personalities you can make these solutions\nHappen and you can just hear that Kenny knows his world he street smart he's slump smart if you'd like he knows how to operate the yeah I don't want to paint ... as a one man band Kenny just awful News I'm doing this in Kibera\nIt's a large organization now that does lots of different things they've got that call school like I mentioned the health clinic football team is always and there are other people involved so Kenny runs they together with his wife and for all that was that they do that very well rewarded he makes a salary of a hundred and forty thousand US dollars a year\nAnd his wife used to make the same I think it's now a bit last still is a lot of money the ...\nYeah I put all of that ...\nThey said the salaries in line with open eyes stations if a similar size ah everything's being signed off by the ... okay in for that you know quite significant amount of money ... they delivering at the moment\nWell they're bringing in a lot of money shelf go just want to two million dollar prize from the Hilton foundation a hotel room yet the guys behind the hotels and that will help with older the ... but there are other projects to ... the only one son who were trying to solve this problem ... not the only game in town\nSo lots of different people and ... thinking about how to live a wolf to into slums\nAnd just in Kibera a you know the ... sudden I'm thinking one woman she's in one of the woman was ... she was a ... a few years back if you're a member of that yeah okay well she runs a foundation that also dreading bull holes that pumping oil syrup right from the ... of Kibera but\nThat delivering it in Jerry cans on caught so they just ... up and passing

the ...\nIt's all with those processes may be the most will be held legally during the daytime than illegally at night so it's a complicated picture ... different players involved as you said it's a ... fit into that\nWell it's interesting one expert I spoke to said that this full health system I actually be quite limited because at the amount of water or you can produce this way\nI tend to ultimately the real solution was what with governments and private utility companies to convince them that you could actually make a profit by building ... piped infrastructure in some itself so that means working with the big guys but as we know that they can be a bit slow sometimes that Congress and\nPeople are shocked co in Kenya but mostly to circle you know faster doing things on the ground they know how it works yeah exactly and that is the whole point of shelf cut their grass roots organization led by the parents spoke you baron's\nThey don't want to hang around waiting for help and that's why they're trying to solve this problem themselves why did I leave you with us from my interview with Kenny when he talks about how all of those mental ... said he had invincible Mentos\nMy doubts about that I ...
