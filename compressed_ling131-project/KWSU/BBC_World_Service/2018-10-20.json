of justice we can talk about that's a little bit more Adrian\nPast what does it mean to you that's politics is really about individualized so I didn't see individuals and small groups very often so cool minorities that's all righty arguing for quality and inclusion and democracy but I think there's a danger that\nDifference is now elevated of a commonality that we're stressing Everytime makes us different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds us together citizenship\nHumanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are out of the same work places animals that are the same communities and in countries say the problem I think in mass its response to individualize and but I think it's an individualized was bumped draw them more communal collect spam\nYes among me into politics his crops two very different phenomena that are going on to the same time it's a lot of confusion stems\nFrom mixing goes up so I'm the one hand what we're seeing at the moment is a lot of a minority groups claiming equality claiming riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing discrimination and on the other hand I think we are seeing\nAs sort of movements but Adrian just said I sort of trying to respond to the basis of liberal democracy from being about individuals to being ... about ... to ... to ... elements of the state line of try to [noise]\nI think the term careers around the idea that we are defined by our power relationships and that who we are is primarily dictated by\nJust about any group that I was born into

what looked like last summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big stick\nA very nice movie which is autobiographical about a Pakistani origin Americans than a comedian who falls enough with a white um how can go into sort of dramatic life story they have no spotless [noise]\nUm I was amazed by the way in which the movie which tells in a mainstream romantic comedy a story of an interracial

who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of it's gotten invest debate the writer was saying\nWho cares if you find somebody who have fought enough of a different race we should celebrate that and was parts of the left\nBut some of food that was problematic exercise leave for me\nIs the crux of disagreement about what society one thinks I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures rather than one where everybody has to stay in the lane and avoid cultural appropriation that I needed a picture in the movie of interracial relationship is probably my\nIdentity politics just become another form of intolerance I think that you know it's interesting that the Ron Paul has come up I find some of the discussions off why can't

all Hollywood wrong call nine eleventh\nFor you and he wants to coming out of there I think on that issue of algae Beatty rights and the way that change but feel free to come into ... well\nI think the what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not\nVenture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also create\nA social atmosphere of fearful illness on a an an artery social level not necessarily just on special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and ah you know if you're at a party\nAnd there is somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani\nBut you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're going to think twice about approaching them and not a big it lies fly because you're afraid of thing something wrong because you might use the wrong word me might express something that's a little you know not all perfect\nThere's that sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying\nAnd they make people socially fearful Asia\nIt's intolerance outline will just mentioned it's also political correctness on ... pops and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's not a binds us together somehow to differences defined as more than the ... of course they're real differences out to be celebrated\nBut also the coming out to the area we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus that shouldn't be warm\nBut at the moment we simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's I think ... bench politics has become\nYou live ... I Would like Exxon tell us I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I hadn't bringing about authoritarianism mount lack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example of the audience\nJust now so so let me give you a couple of examples of first what I wanted to make clear but I think a lot last night in many ways is an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to an understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states\nAnd I think that's one argument that back I met him make but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and that this is a a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the number is also true but the majority of the people who are killed by police in the United states and in fact not African American and that's not surprising given the relatively small ... off the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to the education if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and visit it particularly deepen justice\nBut you know what if you were a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually they're white people got shot by the police as well\nI Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this high off people have never lived in multicultural multi religious monolingual states this is new new situation that we find ourselves and why is it so difficult to negotiate now\nAdrian one of the reasons why I think it's just 'cause I guess it's 'cause a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society ... no longer function fiscal policies trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing up on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions and Ken situations and the communities are not working and I think that's why people fail\nThere's a sense of powerlessness is a sense of of the ... and then that holding on to something which can be a centralized and I think the problem with this uncertainty is it's by definition exclusive\nBriefly ... I think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier Russia\nWhen it's not you disagree with premise I Do think about the tree oil democracies in the world was founded on a mono ethnic ... hotel conception of themselves and thank God we started to challenge fat and we now live in a tidy sum which most people braved the idea of it the more to ethnic society but that is something has talked quite new Korea\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the ...\nQuality and the upset around any corner if he is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that way by is minorities on black people and women and ... people then gay people who are ruining lives with their so called\nIdentity politics and this means we are not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for inequality and suffering\nOkay plenty to think about that thank you for now to our panel grandfather Gopal\nYes among Lionel Shriver an Adrian ... we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let us know what you think of the program or any ideas but topics he likes to look into you can email us that the real story at BBC don't handle UK or tweet me ... and if you enjoy the program we have a podcast you can subscribe to\nJust such a BBC the real story in your poll coughed up [noise]\nDistribution of these services in the U.S is very possible by the American public media producer and distributor of award winning public radio contract PPO American public meeting with support from a financial services for him of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice\nCapital markets BRIC countries with a commitment to putting clients for natural millions first more Raymond James dog call [laughter] [noise]\n\n[laughter] [laughter]\nHemorrhage gates the greens on one side and to the anti immigrant asked the on the alpha meanwhile the S.

hold back on bad feelings is is is not to watch the president and built in a rational utility maximizing preaches we all people who are involved each we're people embedded in relationships institution and an absence feelings do matter\nFilling out of politics I only got are the obvious question that followed from that his belongings onto wet\nAnd he's part of the reason for identity politics that actually it is people expressing offensive on the ... that actually that that identity that with that before whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWhen you had a noted about how during the day these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement ... on the one hand and the UP on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far end of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties and I think that's because Northern Ireland where to place him and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly\nYou're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation\nAnd northern Irish politics with this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tribe then they want representatives\nWho are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interests not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nCotton ... here though is it people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say then shrill voices are very clear that on Nick durable\nIn some ways it works if you'll never end or a movie in India and you are preaching to the idea of an overarching Hindu history to India a Hindu view of India\nWhen that well one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and we we do naturally I think as as a species break up into what are often very competitive\nCall and sorry I'm confused I soft tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem but I Would just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups it's a natural tendency of people too\nAround to break into smaller groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's all good politics happens because those tribes are bad but other tribes are okay I mean I'm\nVery bad I don't take it out yeah I mean I think the\nQuestion is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who are close to them as possible so that starts off with a family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious or ethnic group and the question is how do we deal with this in ... the society in a productive manage\nA one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on national more together to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging and to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen you look at the politics for the last twenty twenty five years I don't think that's realistic because actually specially the age of globalization nationalism retain an incredibly powerful fault and so now it seems to me it's the best response\nIs to try and domestic hated behalf wild feast of national and to try and claim it costs ... to make it intrusive to say that either hire a collective\nUh it does have level of the kingdom of ... states uh but obviously we fight for inclusion of all different route under that combination ... how do you make that journey from being a cosmopolitan and then the rest of the metropolitan elite to being if you like a flag waving patriots [noise] um\nI think patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its fault and all its you know adopt a size of its history but if you love your country and you love the people of your country wherever they from you can also respect patriots who left that country it's a question of mutual respect\nFor the other hand around so badly anxiety saying that you love them that it really isn't that are going to talk what's wrong and loving your country and its people at my hands are accused of other people of identity politics but I'm saying you're not to dream of your poster nationalism I imagine\nYou are and you are you on your um your your national hold your thing making my country but the\nMajority of of Hindu majority of them so I look at nationalism that's something that had served it stop us and the anti colonial struggle but today has become a very deeply dangerous beast\nThe ride was wants to be ... for it is the or the national Congress party but\nOlder a form of nationalism the Congress talk he didn't have ... elements to it the one that we do our days younger various how they read as well as the\nAgent if it's like and bring it back then in a sense that they read we we do seem to be making a distinction between figure identity groups saying that a national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not necessarily such good\nWell 'cause I think the problem is how do we build bridges between all those groups and sometimes you need something more of rocks and I can build a bridge you know we can be workers we can be people of of a place like a village or a city we can be lumped in us we can be people from Manchester\nBut also sometimes that national element is still within the cross 'cause it's found bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further the kind of cosmopolitan is also spoke about that can doesn't have to uh can be a bit abstract I think at the PIN number isn't that up so I think a lot of people feel European\nBritish or German or French but I also feel that have a low cost them see these layers of possible\nSo that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we managed to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with its great diversity of people here and the answer is that if everybody identify primarily with a top national try and\nSay I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu and Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough in common in this country to live together productively peacefully whereas if we've had our sense of collective pride at the level\nWas ... tonight with the actual ... ... ... everybody carry multiple and of course and that you think should between the identity is what she choose for yourself\nOn the ones that have foisted the of course they do and the people like ... like a Martin Luther king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way that I fired for the cause of people who share my identity is to emphasize our common interest as Americans and other than just an emphasized the ways\nIn which discrimination against this group goes against the ideal of the whole a member of the counter vision which says let's celebrate some national identity groups to such an extent\nAnd let demonize any form of collective flowing above it level to such an extent but we no longer have what we need in order to sustain a common ... that's\nA bit of a false distinction because one can argue that the version of British national at something that led to breakfast at which is a big nationalism was on the paint by a sub nationalism that anything less national isn't the way the\nEnglish nationalism and British nationalism which led to breakfast and so again it's I don't think we can have the voting rights that they go down into the into the wild takes a\nWhile I mean it it actually quite a lot of people did vote for that I I personally am not expecting it by majority ... right but but but I think what what you see here is different notions\nOf walked an Asian might be my understanding of an inclusive mission is one that doesn't discriminate and I think there was some amount of than a phobia eating the Brexit vote and technically

on purged two of his advisors and wish I had to be linked to the operation\nPresident Trump called the Saudis statement credit ... a good first step but key members of Congress from both sides of the aisle questioned the Audi account which is at odds with the Turkish explanation that said\nThere was a Saudi hit team with a bone saw and a plan to kill ... with us this morning NPR's Deborah Amos has covered Saudi Arabia for years Debra thanks so much for being with us the money you have seen the Saudis statement what does it tell you about how the kingdom mishandled the crisis\nWhat we see is it for the first time officially the Saudis say that Jamal ... is dead the account places blame on senior advisors none of them really health policy that's gone terribly wrong the Saudis now admit that there is a standing order to bring districts\nOfficials who went beyond the order they killed this dissident journalist\nThey covered up the murder why did the Saudi leadership fail to confirm it that earlier bad news travels slowly to the top is that one Saudi defender put it on Twitter these latest accounts distance the top leadership and especially the powerful crown prince\nBut there are so many questions left to be answered [noise]\nOne of the biggest right in front of us whereas Mr ...\nIndeed so this how do you account says that his body was handed over to a local Turk for

sent Istanbul or why\nA six year old Jim all show gee would start a brawl with this large group most of them were half of his age you know those are the names and the ages of the squad has been

Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the deaths in your mouth to show gee\nWe turn now to even adult or he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now here to Chicago Council on global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is\nThe empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership Mr ... thanks so much for being with us to be based on all of your experience just to Saudi explanation of how Mr ...\nRather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi or explanation by the president\nOr how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and we were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow you respond to let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nAll at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies at first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the\nBrits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end\nThe indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to ... the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is the is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic\nA lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid unborn society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to\nA point of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries that are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet\nThis administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it a lecture and interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a\nPresident the leader of the three world will be willing to go\nMost important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests are and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the in the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo I'd thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are out but it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on and on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy\nAnd make clear that the kind of behavior we named top two weeks it's not acceptable even ... thank you think you\nShow during the for profit is a new you probably remember Haitian mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War\nBut American mercenaries working for foreign powers as something that they were ... been looking into ... an investigative reporter for buzzfeed news and joins us in our studios thanks so much for being with us thank you wire us retired special forces which is what you're talking about your investigation in such a demand\nFor the last Seventeen years\nSeals special forces and other parts of the U.S government have excelled\nAt this modern style of warfare at a sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that said the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and we don't often like to use the word assassination but that is what it is\nMhm but your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI feel you know there's not many other names for them the N. word it definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat\nBy talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden and twenty Fifteen [noise]\nThese special forces or an emcee of veterans maybe see the veterans'\nDay deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the eight and branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is a very important political party in Yemen it's an Islamist party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we write hired this company to kill this local political leader the LA\nAnd Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you should just in this story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was a reservist and he was a seal reservist he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically he had his top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this\nVery strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know [noise] I guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal Jewish citizens couldn't do that\nThere are laws that govern whether the U.S whether us individuals can service officers can add list in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nAre you seeing how Americans have served in the French or why I mentioned French foreign legion in in the article the Israeli defense forces\nAnd these are not a lot of lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during World War II short right yeah\nAnd these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries but I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you're enjoying a foreign military just for the money now and by the way this doesn't apply to people who joined ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is a little\n... this is a buzzfeed story not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an anecdote or a trend [noise]\nRight it's just an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend or they're the only ones who've done this or the other countries who try it [noise] um are there other Americans other than the ones in rather American people to leave\nYou uncovered yet right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm going to keep on looking at it [noise] I've had the honor of interviewing several X. special forces over the years who are working as Secret Service agents\nAnd do this kind of work well there are several reasons one is and there's a lot of money involved but\nThey also argue is they believe this is part of the war on terror their argument is look the way he is close to the United states the UAE he's doing U.S policy the U.S has not spoken out against the war in Yemen we fuel airplanes we sell them bombs we sell them guns we train them we can do to train them\nTheir arguments they're doing what the you you know basically the U.S U.S foreign policy anyway\nSo they've they

obituary that appeared in Vermont weekly seven days\nTouched many readers this week it included a photo of the smiling face of Madeline Lynch in there\nWith her toddler son aid and\nIt was ... from his perch on her back that photo showed a good day for Maddie but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and ... out of high school party\nA drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son metal and Lynch in near died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal\nThanks for having me first we're [noise] we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to saying how she wanted to be\nAn actress and star and Broadway musical and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the ... we knew in lived and then there was that a Matty who suffer from a disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really loved the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm into farm and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nShe drove more than one program I go there to ... yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of us and Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define the way she lived\nAnd such and not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted now um we carried out for them and our hope also now ...\nNecessary so that these deaths stop happening the president daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions medication assisted treatment things like math a donor buprenorphine there's evidence that they work very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver there aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing\nI also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people in that part of the reason that we wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one phase of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\n[noise] understand there's going to be a service for ... Sunday there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWell through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing Bonnie rate song she's just sitting at the kitchen table will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more of that kind of sharing on Sunday\nWhat bunny rich on there [noise] I Can't make you love me\nIndeed I don't know\nNeal wrote about her sister Maddy lynching mayor in Vermont\nTell me\nIf you tune in [noise]\nThe\nHelen Franklin is post forty in English exiled who's had a pretty humdrum time for Twenty years or so she's been in the cosmopolitan city of Prague where she translate sparkling pros like the instructions for washing machines\nSarah Perry rush in her new novel melon most Helen has an Arab sadness who shore she cannot catch that\nCarol a scholar friend gives hell in a pile of checks histories diaries letters footnotes\nAnd she begins to find in those pages the outlines of a woman reaches across centuries from seventeenth century England to Germany the Nineteen forties in modern day manila to witness it absorbs the horror of the forgotten and forlorn ...\nSarah Perry author of the international bestseller the ethics or ... joins us now from New York Thanks so much for being with us thank you for having me sketch Mel must enforce could you please\nStay the premise of the novel is that it's very lonely women begins to hear that there is a ... so called mount most a witness\nWho had been down to one of the day or two thousand years witnessing humanity to the west and she knows what you've done she knows what ifs thoughts and she comes to you and she says look\nI Know how weak you are and how cowardly and if anybody else you would want it but I'm lonely why don't you come away with me and she says people hand and she says take my hand I've been so lightly\nAnd the people that she visits must choose either they go with her because I've given up hope they reject tab because they believe that they can find some ... contentment\nSo Helen here's about misled and and she stopped to think that May Day now most he's watching huh", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "20"}
