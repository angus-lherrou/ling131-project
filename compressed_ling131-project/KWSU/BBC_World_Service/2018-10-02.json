Paris so we take care of some of the expense and the person is going to the professional repair knowing that it can be amended but are we in RIMPAC cafe time have those countries\nBut I think one of the things that should change in the future to get to repair back in to our daily lives is that a professional repair should become cheaper\nAnd now for many people repairing professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor\nAnd labor index tiny so we believe I Believe that\nThe tax system should change and that label or should be taxed lower so that's\nA professional

here we have more than sixty I've been speaking to on through brown low director of the Scottish marine animals stranding scheme\nThis is a little different to what we would normally see in in ... when usual mortality events because I'm the conferences that are coming at Shaw arming credibly decomposed so\nUm we we actually had an investigating this less smoke pathology point of view and more from a sort of oceanographic aspect to try and work out why these animals have come from [noise]\nSo it's not that they're being washed up and then they die they're dead when they reach the surface\nYes exactly um so when we we we have an investigation program that looks at uh the causes mortality of of mammals are stations sales a central\nAnd I'm In the past we've had what a cold must running events why are we to end up on the beach and the uh I'm a significant number of animals I'm all in one group\nTo try and work out why they're struggling happened in this case it's it's a very different picture\nOf what we've seen is over the the course of the last six weeks we've had a an an increasing incidence of I'm a very unusual species that's being washing up I'm light from the sort of the the goal why pay an island all the way the very top of Scotland\nUm so it stays taken us a while to put the pieces together these animals are not alive I'm been dead for for several weeks at sea um but it's very unusual to to get any of these animals coming on TALK shows\nHow many in a normal year would you see and how many of you've seen this year [noise]\nSo in a usual yeah um we would get probably between three and four animals in Scotland of this particular species a it's a ... it's a it's quite a cryptic species we now she ... these these class substitutions\nUm and this year so far um we've had sixty eight of these animals that have been washed up I'm On the shores of islands Northern Ireland in Scotland I'm forty five alone in ... which is\n[noise] they live very deep and the water don't they so what do you think what what is it what is it possible to speculate might be happening [noise]\nWell this is what makes this quite tricky because they um they as you say that the species that live well off the shelf hatch so they they inhabit deep ocean trenches they can they held the record for both the deepest and the longest dive of any any animal\nUm they've been clocked at just under three kilometers down and they can spend up to two hours down the\nThe reason they go into the the they such extreme environments just because that's where they can find that food which is a squid\nAnd um these the square to a large number of them off the off the shelf hedge so this is the normal habitat for the species\nI'm now ... there's the problem is is that when these animals wash your shoulders by limited amounts of pathology that we can divide from from them because it in such a expensive states the decomposition\nHowever we are I'm aware that this particular species is particularly sensitive to I'm underwater noise um human generation wonder what's noise in an in specifically effect to mid range segment\nOn that something that we would want to try and establish whether or not with any particular activities going on off the shelf hedge I'm In the last\nBecause you know humans haven't been quiet and the seat for quite a long time that something like this should be happening now seems remarkable\nUm indeed does that mean we we've we've made the oceans divide noisy place and and that set us instead of a general problem in this specific case\nProblem we have is is that they ... out of the people that all the major Einstein all off in the military and driving information from that and can be quite challenging\nUm the reason that the military operates a an a sudden all this frequencies is that it's used for um communication on a social used for locating underwater objects such submarines\nSo um but obviously this is this is sensitive national security level so they're trying to get the information as to whether they'd be an operation can be challenging however what we hope to be able to do is to establish whether or not they face\nA noise is a plausible reason that these animals taunted so we want to little lived all the other things that could potentially have caused them to strengthen such as talks in this infectious disease\nI'm I'm trying to establish what what is the most likely reason for this this large mortality\n[noise] so many questions Andrew Brown the director of the Scottish marine animals
