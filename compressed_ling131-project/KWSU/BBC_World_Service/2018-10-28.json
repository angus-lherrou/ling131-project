are fading away\nJimmy visited a lot to the east coast down from his coauthor ghost town to the west to highlight their historic appeal an atmosphere they provide for people with a curiosity for the forgotten by ways of the old with\nJim thanks for being here you bet\nSo these ghost towns are kinda like ages for imagining the legendary wild west what is the fun of going to a ghost town for you\nWhile growing up with a lot of kids I fell in love with stories of of discoveries of Bob King Tut's tomb and things like this in\nThese little towns and you can unleash the imagination and I was fortunate as a kid we moved out to Arizona in Nineteen sixty six and a I had an opportunity to grow up in here stories from some of the people who lived in these places and it really inspired a passion\nAnd especially for people our age I mean we grew up watching wider than the rifle man in the raid on boy you walk through a ghost town you can almost imagine dark holiday stepping around the corner\nLots of history in these places and it's amazing that there there's so many times how quickly they boom how quickly they faded a lot of them never monitored more than just literally a tent city but others are like why are light was all modern prosperous community\nAround like it was a town that wasn't even as old as a lot of towns that that I Would think of as ghost towns it began what Nineteen oh five\nNineteen five Nineteen six mhm\nNow that's in Nevada kind of east of Death Valley and when he was running late suddenly this boom town what happened that that helped it what does it have five thousand people and then all of a sudden why watch\nOne of my favorites and it's one of the most photographed sites in the southwest ghost towns and because of ease access it's it's easy to get to just off state highway three Seventy four\nBuildings with a marble floors elevators three cities swimming pools a train depot that will service by three different railroads and by Nineteen ten eleven twelve was gone\nSo there was all based on a mind somebody struck it rich and the mind and everybody went there and they made a little money but then it was overbuilt and what it said that the population peaked at five thousand and are within twelve months dropped below one thousand by Nineteen twenty almost nobody left there\nYeah it was pretty quick a lot of times and while it's a great example there was some real goal discoveries there bought a lot of it was based on stock speculation\nTo some people got rich and right from the gold\n\n\n[noise] in Ireland they said you'll never forget someone if you write a song about\nThe Irish remember the events and the pizza shape their history and the many traditional songs written over the years for America look at some of the heroes of Ireland unreal and some legendary we're joined now by singer Kathy Ryan copies of proud Irish American [noise] she lives in the northeast corner of public about [noise]\nShe's with us right now and travel with Rick Steves\nTo introduce us to some of the people that Ireland remembers and it's a song Kathy so good to have you here it was great to be here whenever I think of you I I just think of just a joy of lights in the context of Ireland helped music ties\nIn with that and I also remember you grew up in Detroit yeah Motown music I mean how did a Detroit girl gets so just swept away by traditional Irish folk music to the degree that you moved there and now you're a well known Irish folk singer\nOn my father was a singer he came from temporary and he was a brilliant tenor fabulous\nAnd my mother was a musician a harsh so she always had music on the stereo playing chopping down member vinyl one after the other plummeting down and also we were members of the gate of the league and the Irish American club in downtown Detroit\nAnd that was our community that was where we socialize so I sang my first son into a lake there when I was seven\nFor my father for Father's Day and I would get up after that sessions singing sessions where everybody sits around and they play instruments and they sing songs\nAnd people don't know that about Detroit it's a it's kind of very very strong Irish population\nHad a bit of Ireland in Detroit\nAbsolutely and then all the time I spent in Ireland as a child and my grandmother's kitchen and my grandfather's kitchens no television the news came on the radio otherwise it was off\nEverything was generated by us and it was all song and story it was a magical time I'm so grateful that I got to have that experience as a kid\nOther countries have music but no other country has music quite like higher\nI agree a lot of people say it's because Irish music things to the heart I Believe it's things to something larger the spirit it Boyd the spirits of the Irish have left through the centuries have no choice of their own to make a living in other countries to go fight in foreign wars\nPlace every single little nooks and crannies in Ireland has a song written about it it is a way to name things and to keep them sacred if you will\nSo when you drive Rhode Island as a tour guide you must be bursting with an interest in order to a new town that has a song about not\nTo I don't want people to run off the\nBus throw me off the bus but yes you can sing a song about everything and for me it punctuate an historical talk something I'm Talking about I can say and now I like to sing this song for you but there are songs about you know winning race dogs their songs about greed horses there are songs about people's families there are songs about death\nIn communities drownings off the coast of ... that are heartbreaking so everything is kept in the music it's a life raft\nAnd heartbreaking is a lot of Ireland's history began if your relationship with England and just tough times and civil war once Ireland wins it's I mean just in a nutshell\nYou were subjugated by the the English for centuries you finally when your independence what a hundred years ago or so and then there's the civil war about how Ireland is going to be managed by its own people\nExactly who's side are you on dean want a completely free Ireland or when you take the interim step of twenty six counties in too and you can get more\nSo the Nineteen sixteen rising yes big deal it was like the American revolution and yes history just a little over a hundred years ago there must be songs that bring you back to that that ... or you're Irish patriotism we're pride\nAnd even better than that right because some of the men and women who were actually on the front lines during the Easter Rising wrote these songs and I'd like to sing one female that's okay sure this is a song that was written by Paul Peirce Patrick Henry peers was one of the signatures of the proclamation of independence\nAnd it's a very powerful song you took an old melody any real new words to it\nAnd he is saying to the people Greece O'Malley who was the pirate clean environment born and fifteenth thirty she was the chief didn't offer clan and she fought hard against the dominion by Elizabeth the first she sang she is coming over the waves and she is going to liberate you from the foreigners\nKnock people from France or Spain we are now going to have our own hero so\nShade da da da da da da da da da da da\nDa\nShe had a\nSon\nThat's just one verse so the Irish are going to save themselves [noise] yes and they're going to do to become Gaelic\nYeah it's going to be the ... not the French or the Spanish and it's going to be gray so now there and I love the corps because what he's over ...\nYou are welcome home you are welcome home now that the summer is coming the rising for them in spring was the planting of that seat he says in the last person to the sun we may not live a week after this right and they barely did we may not live a week after this but in summer will be the boom of what we've done\nSo now at this point there's already been the ... the Ira yes spreading out how many hours tend Irish people in America for every person in Ireland yeah stand which is actually in a global call for the Irish people to recognize it absolutely this is the new morning\nYes because money was being raised in America\nBy ... to bring back to support their efforts in Ireland and also a lot of the musicians there Michael Coleman brilliant ... changed the way Irish people play the fiddle his label was called republic records and they were raising money from the music to send back to Ireland\nIs travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Kathy Reichs cheaper than them guards Irish music now for more than twenty five years before I went on almost like church the lady she's also a solo performer\nKathy was named the Irish female vocalist a decade too tight timeline violent dot com\nThat was born in Detroit now she goes Ireland county lost her home [noise]\nInformation about caffeine albums enter performance schedule on our website let's caffeine Ryan dot\nAnd when we think about it also proud culture of course it's got its struggle with London to be independent\nAnd I understand about the first printed book of Irish ballads also served as kind of a cultural document for Ireland to it's\nA valid history of Ireland I'm not sure if it was the very first book but it was the most lauded book and the most except that it was Thomas Davis who was one of the young Ireland there's the movement on that was very very strong the precursor actually that they would have inspired peers and condemnation and Plunkett\nWhen Ireland was starving during the great hunger Thomas Davis was writing songs about nationhood he was a pacifist who didn't believe in aggression he was a Protestant as well some people listening might thing\nLike fighting together because they wanted Ireland to the nation but he wrote songs and he believed that the best way to serve the history of the country was through it's about a tree\nAnd I think that's true because all of the songs of Ireland struggles are extant they still exist were still singing them they keep it in the present and also they make it very ... everybody becomes a part of this struggle or this this hope because they're singing it\nAnd you get caught up in that even the tourist whose first day in Ireland if they can find themselves into a a pub or you have a session going on that's that's really filled with locals you get caught up in it You're welcome to be caught up in this way the music invigorated the national spirit\nAbsolutely and I think one of the reasons why is because we all know in Ireland uh singers and musicians that it's not about us it's not the culture of celebrity that sadly we're going into now it's about the song or the chain\nAnd we are serving it now if it was a great song or two and it was there before us and it will be there after so we're just playing our part and continuing the culture\nYou know when I was in Dublin recently of course you're going to hear her street musicians and your music and the\nPubs you actually hear street poets people that are standing on the street corner and they'll they'll do perjury for your eye on request but yeah I understand a word and the thoughts that you've got poet who put their poetry to music and something artists don't realize it was an extra dimension was a great Irish poet that might have been caught up in the music\nYeah it's ... ... and I when I'm On the coach as a tour guide I play dates reciting his poetry because he sings is I Will ...\nGoal now go to ... free and he's singing as you know you can hear the song in his voice but she after the young islanders she\nBelieved the same things as they believed and he believed that Ireland's identity came from its culture\nAnd they needed to come home to that culture and he would write plays and poetry about the mythological figures the great heroes of Irish myth\nIf I could sing a little bit of a home is that when he put it in the music by a German composer it's the song of the wandering Angus and gets old was the son of the great got the doctor and a great ... who formed the Boeing river\n\nIt's got all the makings of a tabloid headlines or an action movie the son of one of America's richest families travels to an exotic locale\nDisappears mysterious circumstances and is rumored to have been eaten by camp was the truth or did you grow\nAs the official reports clean [noise] journalist curl husband was determined to find out what actually happened to Michael the Rockefeller the Twenty one year old son of New York governor Nelson Rockefeller was never seen again after he went missing in New guinea back in Nineteen sixty one up\nWe traced Rockefeller tree to archives we interviewed I witnesses to come to his own conclusion which he writes about in the carpet a tale of chemicals colonialism and Michael rockers tragic with good to have you back on the show thanks so much\nHe was the son of Nelson who was the governor of New York at the time and he graduated from Harvard and went off to New Guinea to work on a film and his father had opened the museum of primitive art as it was called then\nA few years earlier and Michael was a trustee and while he was in New guinea he heard about people called the as Matt who lives in the south west coast and were incredible ... and he determined to go to as Matt and try to collect some as Matt art\nWhich he did he made a quick a sort of a reconnaissance journey of a few weeks and then went back to the film and then when that was done he decided to go back\nFor a couple of months and not on that trip pie vanished so\nMichael Rockefeller was Twenty one years old this was back in Nineteen sixty one and you're studying this did it seemed like he was just a buccaneer looking for this indigenous art to bring home to the primitive art museum or did he really become enamored with the culture and just wanted to learn more about it and and connect with\nWell I think it's a little bit of both I mean I don't think Michael was much of a buccaneer he was young Ernest man very smart well educated he'd grown up around art you know the way I'm most American Kids have grown up around baseball and um you know some of the greatest started of of the world\nKey was enamored of ... and fascinated by asthmatic culture an asthmatic carving it means you know the best of the carving the most spectacular of these things were you know twenty three twenty four foot high up polls kind of like totem poles if you will\nI think he had a an earnest interest in it I mean you know at the same time he was young he was inexperienced he was wealthy he you know got access and breaks for the regular person wouldn't have had and certainly those things contributed to the disaster that he fell into\nInnocence in New guinea this is a huge island down them between Thailand and Indonesia as one of the most remote places on earth really how do you go there and find the artistic treasure and then by it to bring it home what's the mechanics and that\nWell at the time it was known as Netherlands New Guinea was Dutch New Guinea the last Dutch colony him to east indies and that of course made it a little bit easier for him but the region that he went to was as mad it's ten thousand even today it's ten thousand square\nNo electricity or he bought a boat from a Dutch Colonial patrol officer a sort of a two dugout canoes with a little bit of a sort of Huck Finn like a cabin on top then\nWith the Dutch miner or thirty four year old anthropologist named Renee waltzing into local boys they just went off from village to village\nYou know and they would arrive in the village and say they're interested in stuff\nAnd people would bring it out but you have to understand in Nineteen sixty one as Matt was an incredibly remote place really western contacted just been made in the late Nineteen fifties and as Matt where a\nA people of great artistic passion and power but they were also a constant warfare with each other and\nWe lived in a world of the sacred reciprocal violence\nOf which the art was all a part in a you know and and head hunting was an integral part of their culture and part of that had hunting you know was also some cannibalism and Michael unwittingly stepped into a very complex political world and he ended up at the wrong place at the wrong\nTime and you know you could be very well team sophisticated but from a cultural point of view could also be very naive and green venturing into society well one of the great\nIronies of the story is that you know this is a a man from who represents you know the most powerful family and the most powerful country in the world in and ask mad at a crucial moment he was\nA the least powerful man and all the world and you know cannibalism is all about intimacy and power and it's all about taking somebody's power\nThe head hunting and you know when the as Matt man who killed them did so they were taking back their power sort of a desperate bid to take power back that had been usurped by Dutch colonialists and Dutch efforts to pacify them and take away their culture and [noise]\nAnd they consume them and there's no more [noise]\nArticulate display of of power than that so\nDid they eat Rockefeller thinking they were just feeding a white guy that represented colonialism or did they know the eating a man from the most powerful family in the most powerful white country [noise]\nThey didn't know anything about the Rockefeller's the Rockefeller name meant nothing to them I mean it's a complex story that in a nutshell in Nineteen fifty seven as I said the Dutch we're trying to pacify the as mad in Nineteen fifty seven [noise]\nMen you know they killed each other and a very aggressive or racist Dutch Colonial patrol officer went to the village specifically to teach the village the lesson as he wrote in his report than he\nWas afraid and he brought a lot of armed policemen with and then he arrived in to this village of ... which was a\nLegendary you know traditional place to place that had resisted the incursions of the Dutch and didn't want to change its ways why should it why would want to\nHe ended up opening fire and killing five people and that left the village with a sacred obligation to you know everything was ... I mean spiritually and it left the village with a sacred obligation to reciprocate the men's death than Michael kind of swam into that as it turned\nOut so he gave them the opportunity to reciprocate basically stumbling into their world Pete did\nCurl up and then on assignment to more than Seventy countries has the report to them travel with Rick Steves he's telling us what he discovered about the plight of Michael see Russia as he investigated his disappearance [noise] end that deadly clash between cultures in the jungles of New Guinea his book is called Savage Harvest [noise] now\nI don't want I guess I'm focusing on kind of listen it's fascinating and apparently it's it's a reality but I guess when these tribal people decide to feed a human being is not a matter of nutrition it's not like the Donner Party it's a matter of um [noise] power and symbolism is that right\nYeah it's not like you know we're hungry let's go get a Big Mac or anything is either going to get an animal in that regard but you're just searching yourself by symbolic well immediate ritual is theory somebody\nYeah it gets very complex but you know cannibalism is with in a is a sacred act with in a complex Web of obligation and ceremony and customary laws and that has great meaning and important\nIs there a ritual that stick way to actually cook the person\nYes very much so which I won't go into a here but I Do in the book\nThe Rockefeller family maintains that their son was was not a victim of chemicals well ... when he was actually\nOn a boat crossing the mouth of a river that to ... engine trouble and then flipped over and drifted and Michael a sad you know I think he violated the first law ... which is to you know never leave the boat as long as it's still flowed and he said I think I can\nYou're on your own I'm not leaving and Michael did and he swam away from the boat and he was never seen again\nAnd there was a massive search and of course Renee was rescued the following day by Dutch patrol planes there was a massive search for Michael you know Nelson and Michael sister Mary both went to New Guinea immediately and\nUp fairly sophisticated search for I'm In no trace them was ever found so it was natural to assume that he had disappear and of course Renee had seen him swim off that he disappeared it's the but as it turned out very soon afterwards there were\nDutch missionaries who had been living in a among villagers for years and spoke the local language and\nBegan making their rounds and hearing reports that Michael had in fact made it to shore and encountered men from the very specific village and that he had been\nKilled and they actually investigated it fairly thoroughly and wrote detailed reports I mean so detailed they name names who had his thigh who had ribs you know who had his glasses\n\nBBC World service it's five hours GMT welcome to weaken poll had been coming up we have from the counselor whose district in the U.S city of

that alternatives\nWe'll have to be found for example if you don't use a plastic bottle then you'll have to use a glass bottle how much energy goes into the use of that glass bottle how much energy goes into either recycling into just throwing in the landfill one has to consider what the alternative is for each use of a single use plastic\nI saw the whole point was that there was single use plastics and a glass buffalo you can take back to shop and refill and using many times as you want to tell them I mean that is the perceived with them surely\nWell not necessarily I haven't seen many return of bottles in the United states at about twenty five years\nWhether love modem in Europe I can tell you well that's fine they're also costs money to scrub those bottles up and use\nThem again it's not the single use plastics should be used it's not that getting rid of them isn't a good thing but you have to be careful about being sweeping\nI'm just curious as to what the alternatives to sweet thing is I mean if if you introduce legislation to ban single use plastic say\nIt all depends on where it doesn't need it a good thing or is it no it's in your opinion I don't think it's a good thing to have a sweeping ban should such measures Big Bend is so that it becomes written into global trade deals that\nNot just bid on European Union then it's certainly not good for the world I Would like to see fewer single use plastics out there right now what do they live near the plastic forks or are going into restaurants and being handed Styrofoam cups and things\nTerm you have to be careful about how you go about this because you might end up using more energy rather than less it depends on the energy use of the alternative that's the problem\nRight then you decide to just you know blindly regulation on you know something this is a good example of why it breaks it\nIt's just kind of I'm thinking man day out of fossil beds for people to vote the way they do\nBut surely it boils down to whether it's best to to use reusable items again and again or to you possibly can convince the science shows that you are damaging environments less by not using plastic full surely there isn't much of a debate about it unless you represent the interests of plastic folk maker\nI don't represent anyone's interest by the way I guess I heard over and over again to you that getting rid of most single use plastics probably make pretty good sense\nFor getting rid of all I don't know and that's what bothers me about this legislation but they may be circumstances which the alternative material actually causes more on the environment because in in the nature of the way you use\n[noise] Peter Morici who's an economist and business professor at the union but University of Maryland in the U.S what did you make of that Chitra\nWell [laughter] I understand why he's saying about having to look at the energy footprint of alternative but I Do think that environmental degradation on

bags being bombed on the African continent for example in Rwanda Kenya march ... and Morocco\nAnd of course across the world ... taxes on plastic bags um I think it's a very welcome development my

strollers\nUm but by and large I think it's a beyond that it it's a welcome development and I'd also like to like not just that single use plastic but other kinds of statements from the oceans as well\nSo I was really struck by the high proportion of plastic and in the oceans that's deep sea fishing I think twenty seven percent of the ... on a beach is from that and and I'd like to look at that as well as and clean up as well as prevention\nMatthew I Know this is an issue close to your heart's it's a civil liberties issue I think is is warts that boils down to the piece of Marie ...

alive to everything that was\nThings in their sleep\nBetter than adults and this is clearly true for any of us who've had young children alone or others you can take them to a\nDisco practically let's say to a wedding with the pounding music and lunch they're asleep they stay asleep through and [noise] and the answer is that at that developmental stage of childhood sleep is more important than knowing what's going on\nThis ... sites that adolescents baby elephants a bone pretty much immediately able to walk around follows the herd see the difference between say some dangerous places a baby humans are blown dependent\nSo the trade off we make us human ... unable to the cough drops elves and in that time without early stage of development the first two years sleep is incredibly important\nBecause it's sleep the replay the experiences of the day strength from the connections that we've developed and lose the ones that are simple so the tradeoffs that we make as humans is to\nBuild children's that basically ignore everything when they're sleeping because sleep is more important than working out what's going on and that's because we're born dependent on our parents to the officer is\nA ... can fend for themselves pretty much from both humans calms\nNow the question of why your mother's voice is more important than any other is an interesting story also about humans from before with tuning in to sounds that message to us and so the first few months of life we're exquisitely sensitive\nTo the whole range of environmental sounds that we encounter the kinds of music

that we have these gigantic institutions doing on re high street banking which we all depend on small businesses depend on day today and all full of global investment banking and they got into trouble all novel lives France\nAnd the second heading was how to make the banks more resilient in the sense of being able to absorb losses if we're more likely when the next crisis hits we recommended a kind of separation of cold ring fencing so this is the idea\nThat the only high street banking retail banking current account side of the draft let's call things which we all as individuals and small businesses depend on which a government can't let for life without titled calamity\nThat those activities in major banks\nShould be in a self standing powder the bank separated from the global investment banking commodities trading derivatives exposures to other kinds of financial institution and all those other things it shifts the dial it increases the odds that you wouldn't imperil

financial crisis and improve mountains and made them was\nI think that he has made things worse and even though it may have been the first response you know quick solution it's really ended up with a system ten years later that's pretty scary and distorts the economy about competition and about and just about anything\nFor growing complexity into dependency on the banking system was facilitated by revolutionary technological changes such as growing computer power which allowed physics and math graduates to build financial products\nWhich the top bosses with lemon regulators politicians and customers do not understand\nFall from reducing and offsetting risk renovations were raising and spreading it\nI think we were told that all these innovation that word you know used around Silicon Valley where I Am a lot innovation was kind of a great thing that it would allow you know more efficient funding it would spread the risk ever more efficiently around the world\nAnd instead it was really a lot of financial innovation is really about clever ways to hide or asks and clever ways to avoid taxes and clever ways to do things that are not necessarily used for for society so yeah it's some level you you want it functioning financial system and the financial system can do wonderful things\nBut out of control it it's really dangerous and I think that a lot of energy was spent in

saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the elections\nAt that precipice again and it's a similar lines between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo piece position on health care [noise]\nDefinitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue was the Affordable CARE
