of voice\nAnd after President Trump Trump campaigned on a promise to revamp the deal there just isn't a real young is here's what exactly is happening in the north American\nFree trade agreements has been around for the past quarter century but Donald Trump or when he was campaigning to president said it was to blame for next to this old manufacturing jobs out to the United states and he promised to renegotiate it now I have to force me to education in the sense Mexico and the U.S to deal with\nA few weeks ago about Canada was holding out and it led to this\nThree times we deal would collapse

forcibly displaced a presumably the residents to different location to\nAh just remind us that why does the government wanted to demolish it\nThere's a few levels you have to understand here the the reasoning that the government is giving is that it's a simple planning issue which you know sounds innocent enough but there's two other is she has a place here one is that we're talking about occupied territory and according to human rights groups of the Palestinian authority as and\nOr is anything from a war crime to a great for each of international law and on the geopolitical level it the location of the village is very very important um it's it's in a place of the west bank where if\nThe Palestinian population is removed and Israeli settlements coming to replace them where there's already settlements are existing there are many people say that it would it would cut the west bank into two different pieces\nI'm making a contiguous territory impossible should we ever see some sort

the residents claim that it's actually privately owned land owned by a a a nearby a Palestinian town\nUh but the other thing you have to understand about Area C and and there's really control there is that the Israeli military which is responsible for approving a building permits and in that area that you mentioned denies\nWell over Ninety percent of Palestinian requests for building permits and the residents of kind of a smart one of their their last ditch attempts to stave off this this demolition was to submit a their own planning\nAnd their own master plan for for normal lives and the the the the building permanence of of their village and something that Israeli government allows settlers Jewish Israeli settlers to do when when they're caught building a what the Israeli government uh describes says go ahead\nMichael surely the Israeli government then has offered them an alternative taste she'd go to despite a international objection to this ... oh tennis your pace and where would that be then\nThere is it's a location not too far away um\nIt's also very close to a trash dumped a which is you can imagine it's not as not ideal for this for this residents and the other the other problems I have with it is but it's it would presumably stop them from a continuing their\nUh their lifestyle which involves so [noise]\nShould we said they've been unable to the international objection to this including the un advancing against it but it has not ... and ... and has gone to had to wait and see what's likely to happen if they should go ahead\nYou know the Israeli government has been trying to [noise] to sort of take over the Syrian or most of the Palestinian population for a few decades now\nAnd up until the Trump Administration the Americans and the rest of the world have essentially told the Israeli government do not do this and now there's very little resistance um the European Parliament orange that it would be a grave rich rich with international law or last

Canada was playing a tough a game\nBut minutes before us imposed deadline on Sunday night all too well and Washington reach that agreement both sides say the new United States Mexico Canada agreement\nWill result in free market ferret trade and rip off to economic growth in the region but Canada how how to given some American demand talked to him and he joins of trade experts at Oxford University told me that kind of how to go to Todd I'm prevented us from getting everything that it wanted\nAt the Canadian team has done very well and it's like I said it pretty hard um has read correctly the constraint on Donald Trump that actually purchased by Congress and the U.S isn't it\nI'm Sorry threat was that it kind of candidate wasn't going to play pool ... go ahead with a bilateral agreement with just the United states and Mexico\nBut the reality once he would have struggled to get through that for the U.S Congress I never have been a huge amount of pressure on him against such a bilateral deal that that's kind of outcome from his own business people that we could have not really a credible threat and the Canadians understood that\nCanada they have had to allow us farmers more access to a dairy market and this was a big sticking point to promise Canadian bombers it wouldn't do that to the potential you tried out I'm into this deal for Canada\nIt's very early hours we're really in the very we haven't seen the details of the tax my understanding is that what they what the Canadians have agreed it's only a tiny bit more than they already agreed back in the days of the Trans Pacific partnership agreement [noise] um\nIs that they're a market by opening up a little bit of a three percent of the dairy market and my understanding is I haven't seen the text yet but my understanding is that they can a tiny bit more than that but they didn't it's nowhere near the radical overhaul and opening up of the Canadian dairy sect that the U.S with with aiming for the stock the talks\nAnd the other thing that's very important to recognize that the candidate has been very successful so we understand again it's added days but and we understand and preserving the what's called the dispute sacrament mechanism chapter Nineteen of the original NAFTA which again the U.S wanted to water down so it does seem that candidates sort of how time on that\nStole the trouble with that when it came to doing trade deals and he said he would renegotiate an awful lot of them after being at the top of the list\nBut it would be America's first and other countries that they would do deals with the U.S if it was when when they show the trumps way of doing trade does actually worked because it is the world's biggest economy people will give us pretty much whatever it won't\nTurn down to the U. S. it shoots when it comes to the global economy and not just give them an edge in the negotiations that playing with some very acute and they go take a pot and then we saw the U. S. renegotiating the deal with Korea I actually again it was held up at a big renegotiation revamping of the U.S Korea trade agreement\nActually the Korean again gave relatively deco I'm part of that just comes down to the fact that the United states where the Trump Administration doesn't have quite as much but it goes for domestic me that they need to put through a really radical agenda say they're getting a lot of pushback from the U.S business\nYeah somebody did also but what if it was about their neighborhoods and and whether they would talk to people and it was interesting looking because we have people from all over the well take pause\nAnd in in nine countries in particular we were able to do more detailed comparisons and that we found that um the the UK and then and I'm from in the U.S has kind of comfortable uh levels of letting us and India but it was a bit lower in New Zealand which was interesting\nAnd we also looked in in terms of bigger regions we looked at a which countries\nAre places where people really value that independence and northern Europe is a place that would very much be the case and they have high levels of learning us in the countries where people were very independent than in the places where people tend to depend on each other more and be happy to depend on each other\nSo being independent it's not necessarily a good thing now the prime minister added to see I told you said at times to levy aid loneliness and social isolation with a warning that millions of people were suffering from a lack of regular contact with us which is what you were pointing to in being independent how'd you sold this though what's the strategy\nWell we asked people what solutions they found it was for them in a closer to ... because it is to find out what is actually what for people for people they know it is amazing\nUm number one was finding distracting activities or oh dedicating all the time to work or study all hope is next for joining a social club that also came on the list of most I'm helpful suggestions that people make so it's not for everybody\nI'm changing your thinking to make it more positive to to look them on the bright side of things off of a sea sometimes easier said than done\nAnd I told 'em before was interesting that you're starting a conversation with anyone because it hasn't got to be deep meaningful long conversations that people have that can alleviate loneliness chanting somebody when you buy your paper in the shuffle or ... or whatever those little things remind us we connect to everybody else in the real human\nSo bad BBC well said this this Wednesday at twenty sassy GMT\nNow a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name denotes Macedonia has failed to pass the turnout threshold if I was necessary because Greece lays claim to that in a message or historical reasons\nHowever had fell short of fifty to central Clyde ... campaign to boycott the polls that any results suggest that more than Ninety percent of those it did so supportive to change it means it like it could be not shed political maneuvering a head out Balkans correspondent died that no one even Macedonia capitals stop\nThe result of the significant player for prime ministers ... he'd made the name change his top priorities since taking office last year but a nationalist campaign to boycott the polls rather than you know just being devastatingly successful\nThe low turnout which means the referendum isn't buying it missed as I've said the boycott wouldn't derail the deal with Greece\nLeaving aside the organized voice caused by the opposition I expect the huge majority of the citizens who voted have chosen the European ... [noise]\n\nSupporters of the boycott campaign held a policy in front of the national assembly they said they stood up for Macedonia is right to self determination\n\nI Want to keep the same name for the same country wherever I go I Will be Macedonian\nAnd it can be the I don't want to be north or upper eastern I just want to be the republic of Macedonia I think the word north would've ended decades old dispute over the country's name with neighboring Greece which has its own region cold Macedonia\nAthens had agreed to drop its objections to Macedonia joining NATO and the European Union as long as it ratified the name change\nThat now looks and extremely complicated challenge but so many to cut Jessica ...

La Nina setting that would imagine that twenty eight team was going to be comma every year has some extremes Wilders a big place after all\nThat's what made some are twenty eight teams so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of the systems science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods wildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out around the entire northern hemisphere and there are some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually well captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks shots gr off tossing global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fine up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks at least nine among annual average is a food ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann admits that these global averages or any parts of the climate story and know the ... that matters to us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we\nSort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public into policymakers too often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yes we expect average temperatures on earth to continue to increase in\nThat has huge ramifications for global sea level rise for melting of ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather and those statistics can be the average is because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes and so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes\nAre changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater weight to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time on our television screens in our newspaper headlines that is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless I won't watch to be cautious\nWell not necessarily harming our what we can precisely the reason why won't do echinacea or any of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's right to say this is something different something that can be quite rare and now I ran into the call in and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nAs the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived herds of heat to heat waves the atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods\nAt the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worse droughts you take extreme drought you combine it with extreme heat you're going to get wildfires so the science there is pretty basic as I said before it isn't rocket science as we say here in the states\nBut what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is the fact that climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream in a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger an apple two ... and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the high stress the jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks\nThey also put another high over Siberia with high heat that an over North America where the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California with seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says Michael Mann\nCalifornia is getting warmer in warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um it's getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress\nUm the summer droughts are so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential for worst wildfires and what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be the summer's fire season in California Winter isn't now California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of last winter was the Thomas wildfire last winter\nAnd in the Mendocino Complex fire in northern California and some of the other wildfires that broke out so California now has in essence a perpetual fire season and that is an indication of the the profound challenge the climate changes already posing\nTo\nFor our historic or more in the largest fire forty now bigger than the size of Los Angeles [noise]\nThese are the\nConditions lived experienced funded and yet ... David some of our experts at the University of California\nCompounded the tree stressing effects of long term drowned was enough rain in northern California last winter to stimulate a surge of gras Scruggs to add an abundance of drawing on the drugs which fueled foreign storms\nIn some parts of California we had a hundred and eighty percent of normal for graft production so I think a lot of fire people were thinking\nYou know this just isn't looking good and all it's going to take is an ignition on the right day with the right whether to cause a real problem and so when the Carr Fire started I was over here I live on the coast and suffered from some of the hot weather and things like that but\nPretty immediately that fire was raising hairs and my husband actually went over and worked on that fire and um I I think we we're all feeling tension that we're not used to feeling around fire in California and we've had it you know the last\nTen years we've had unprecedented fires almost every every year every other year but the Carr Fire felt different\n... affecting a major residential time balls in itself trying to find but the big one was to find the Mendocino hills actually a pair of funds started on July the twenty seventh ... early finally confirmed extinguished last week\nThere was the ranch fire and the river fire and those were burning nearer to each other on the north and west sides of clear lake which is one of the largest lake from California\nIt was during the height of the summer so the hottest days over a hundred degrees solid winds blowing to those areas it was just all the right conditions for fat tire spread and extreme fire behavior and so the fires grew so quickly\nThey were sometimes burning twenty thousand acres in a twenty four hour period or or more maybe the the rate of growth made it very difficult for Cruz to to get a handle on it and they ended up burning four hundred and ten\nNext biggest says last year and Southern California at two hundred and eighty thousand acres so very large area\nOf course it's not just being heat waves and science well California bunt in Canada south India they had the worst monsoon funding in a hundred years [noise]\nMild tasty she wants to say I think for some strange [noise]\nI'm originally from Caroline my family and religious at all and my parents they're seeing this kind of lead for the first time in their life even my ... parents might not have seen a flood like this especially in our area there was a large flooding Nineteen twenty four\nBut the impact of the current threats were much more\nThis is Roxie coal an Indian meteorologists who's been looking into the long term trends in their behaviors among students which he attributes to global warming the candidate rains he told me were quite exceptional\nV. hat on Fifteen and sixteen though for August\nFor the state outraged rainfall we had about one tattoo to one fourteen millimeter per day rainfall and that is the ... in two days it's about two hundred Seventy millimeter that two days of rain for record about one month today and for for the entire state\nIf you look at the entire wreak V. go up to about three hundred fifty person more informed than norm so that's how exceptionally thought that it just never happened in the ... century\nWashington state university [noise]\nComing up off to the news on the BBC well so I was it hard to talk with me Stephen ...\nThe old son who's in European politics are crumbling votes has seen fed up with the long established supremacy of the policies of senator rice and senator left\nThe politics of identity and rule in motion and fueled populist insurgents says are basically to Sweden to Eastern Europe mostly it is the right not the land in the Senate and\nWell my ...

that would work\nIn compressed and just a position to the kind of this lady ... they would work well on the base let's have a debate about what is on the table by the way I Am a click I borrowed from

rapidly but that's what we must do similarly if I waste is we\nWe must do we've just discussing for much of this interview the problems facing the European Union because frankly have a democratic

but you're going to fight in elections on as let's face it you said you're a Democrat and you're going to walk the walk and talk talk and I respect that but if one looks at\nCurrent polling and you say well when you you'll wind the movement has been around for a couple of years but you on you so the fact you'll do scoring virtually zero in the polls will let that pass in there and I hope you owned by the way and grace we'll let you know bankrupt\nLead for ... and I want to do that I Want to get to is this\nThe only country in Europe right now where the left and its more radical form is actually doing well or at least gaining traction with a significant part of the population is in the United kingdom and if so wanting me can you know the u._k. very well want in your view makes\nJeremy cool Britain's Labour pot\nSay what but it has had to do with it\nBecause ... has been a slap in the face of progressive independently of what their view about Brexit well I mean I was going to the labor party view on Brexit is extraordinarily confused so I found fusing issue\nIf you're confused when you're facing a confusing issue are you a fanatic but given the Kobus position on bricks that remains even off the Labour Party conference unclear I Can't see how bricks it can be the driver of the ... did was create it at a station in this country\nThat British democracy and they throw in the world cannot be taken for granted it means to be invented let's look at that look at the the bright side this gives the people who have Britain and opportunity do what do you consider their position in the world and I believe that Jeremy has been doing a very good job\nAt a recognizing that the last fifty years of privatization of moving towards a business model that effectively tied the economy's growth on two bottles on the housing bubble and on the city of London and he's causing any assessment of aid even with that or it's\nInteresting so you would say because you talked about last generation of politicians in the u._k. who in your view played that sort of neo liberal economic ... you would say the Tony Blair was in no way are left of center politician would you\nWhat that took me on the one hand he was because he gave a lot of money but that's not how service money that the Saudis to stop the national health service off but that the very same time\nHe did it by aligning himself fully with the city of London turning a blind eye to the private money ... thing of the private banks and creating the circumstances that lead to has been an eight and to the collapse emphasizing the night so\nWe bought I'm getting too is that the John Macdonald ... the the current shadow chancellor of the exchange rate here in the case has made a big speech\nWhere he's painted a picture of a radical economic program including just one example the man the tree imposition on business in the u._k. ever need to have ten percent of ... given to the workers in the company the dividends would then go to those workers and\nThat would be a cap on the amount of dividend to be received by each worker on the excess beyond that would go to the government so it actually is a huge new corporate tax it would fundamentally change the relationship between the state and the corporate sector in the u._k. in a very sort of left of center way do you really believe\nPut forward there have been proposing to McDonald about the program we eras things you've been saying for cyber opposing\nPrecisely that with one difference\nI've been proposing the creation of a social ... fund where that ten percent of the shadows\nAfter every ideal or capital racing by corporations go into the public will fund and then the dividends are distributed to the former universal basic didn't whereas they were ... a steaming them up amongst the workers\nWithin those corporations but what I think it's very important to remember this is not even need the money has to get this is part of the Labour Party conference he may go into the money first of all I Hope it does if he's a fading interesting discussions that we must have even thought it must have\nAbout the divisions between competent labor but it differently statement once upon a time when and that sort of both the machine the machine belong to the doctor list and then they invested live who claimed the profits of the machine produced for the company\nBut these days of Google and Facebook when every time you see such and your Google Search engine for something you're providing capital to Google and no one is getting to transfer that except for Google we have to reconsider property rights over that he times with capital and live that everybody is the only party in the world that is doing this\nOkay so for you definitely you tell your labor party represents a beacon of hope but throughout this interview you've been saying we must do this we must do that and I've been pointing out that actually in the real world and the world of politics and opinion polls your ideas are not gaining very much traction if we leave side of the United kingdom so I just was\nIs there what am I looking at some point say to yourself you know what democratic politics doesn't what we're going to find new ways one labor MP in what I'm saying she said ... there's no central to that we need to topple this government if we can't do it on the ballot box we will do it with a general strike\nBy working with the trade unions is that you kind of policy what's actually strike is not illegal to last time I\nChecked into them to legal

bowling in a small rural village in villages stone in southwest Pakistan many girls that were denied an education when Hamid was growing up but her father took the unusual step of leaving the family to different cities so she and her sister could go to school\nLeaders bond with her dad was very close\nOf the things that I remember I clearly that he would put the on his shoulders and he would walk around the village and he would show many different things every time a different route\nAnd we would go around the streets me holding on to his hair and my feet kicking his shoulders and he would be very proud of telling me about the world while everyone stared I have to say even at like two or three years of age I knew that people who are watching and they were shocked at how\nNot his son by his daughter was on his shoulders and by that he meant to show me where my place was in the world\nMost fathers of the children that\nThey were very much he knew he saw the potential and me way before I did\nMost of the girls there was a knowledge amongst all of them they would be getting married and ... and young as well as you talk about about together\nMy sisters and I would go back to the village and see that two or three or four cousins girls have been married off without even knowing\nIt mostly because decisions like that are made behind closed doors and especially by their fathers but the other thing was that they knew that when they stopped a marriage like that they're honoring their fathers so it would very much in bills in our mind said when\nSomeone comes up to you and say hey your father has decided to give you to this person in marriage even if you're nine years old you would say yes father because that makes him a very dignified man in this society and hence that fills our hearts with joy\nAnd there's a story in that particular about new on Rene you'll fall to an an an how you're done exactly\nBecause honor was actually associated with men as I was growing up anytime they would talk about on her it was\nThe honor of men and how we had to preserve their honor and how we as girls were this old people who would dishonor them as well I remember one time playing with my friends and we were making clay dolls and scooping mud in my hand and\nShe was for it to me and she's like or equal killed his wife because she dishonor to him\nAnd it shocked me because I didn't know what dishonor to men is and slowly I started learning about honor killings\nThat is why and actually one time my father wants me to come sit next to him\nAnd he asked me he's like highly gee you know how you will to San army and I was like this is that ... that day when I find out what is that one big fan\nAnd my heart just kept from being in my test and I was really really worried and he's like he will define army when you fail in school [laughter]\nThat is one for the first time I realized that the job was always always with me\nBut it also let me see my uncle that the fear in his eyes that the whole time that I was in that house he kept looking at me and believing that I Would hug the job and it was very very devastating for me to see and I was like I I forgive you said it in my heart\nAnd that is when I knew I forgave him\nBut because of that I became much stronger and much more powerful and my work\nI mean some people will still don't really understand how you can forgive this mom I mean do you understand how they think about this\nI knew that I'm a former cell phone mine would be very very much dislike my decision\nIt was never for him whoever forgave him or anyone else they forgave them for themselves the moment I did it I learned that it was because I wanted to be free of that bird and I wanted to be free to be more powerful\nAnd the moment my heart agreed that I have forgiven him I turned into that one powerful woman that I wanted to be from all these years and really challenge things like\nThat [noise] no ... on the poster sun sends you come tightened up took and you're all around the world and they've also lead you to read the love lord [laughter] tell me about this I feel bad [laughter]\nI honestly I never really thought that I Would ever fall in love even though I was fighting against honor killings a deep down the same customs had taken root in my heart and whenever the mention of love would come my heart would be in a way that made me feel like it's not something that I desire so my whole\nGoal was always to just continue with my work\nBut when you first realize that you were in love with the produce an American [laughter] huge didn't initially think oh let's let's just get married in the real good [laughter]\nSo after meeting David and being extremely impressed by him and he feeling the same way I saw my father and honestly I I remember being like I Can't believe what I've done to him\nI Can't believe all those years he gave me everything when I started trying he told me I was going to be an artist when I started writing he told me I was going to be a writer he kept telling me what potential I had what kind of leader I Would be but I had turned into that leader and given him all of these\nIllnesses and all of this heartache so I said that I Would do everything that makes you happy and so in that time I actually decided to married I was about twenty four years old\nAnd that by that time I should be a grandmother and my village [laughter] so I met someone and I decided that I Would marry that man and fully intended on doing that and I introduced him to my father as well\nAnd turns out while I'm fully planning the date of the marriage and writing down in my journal about the details of the wedding and everything and how we would live or\nPuppy Sonny Boy would be ideally suited for one reason [laughter]\n\nMy father just likes to keep surprising me and keep giving me all of this heartache why like do the same for him he said that he's going to steal your light\nHe's going to take away your positivity and I looked at my father that is when he fully opened up to me he told me something that he'd never ever mentioned we were actually away from the family we were walking in a park so that none of my other siblings here\nAnd he told me a story that really changed my thinking about him\nHe told me that when he was seven years old when he had just started going to school and he had started discovering the love for his education he would walk to two religious from his village and go to that one school that was really far from him\nOne morning he was walking to that village where his school was\nWhen there was calls on the street just like a village life where everything is normal even buy everything looks chaotic and he was walking through the streets when he saw a big group of men standing in a corner looking at something on the ground and his\nVoice curiosity had him he wanted to see what everybody was looking at and so he struggled to push everybody aside and go through that crowd it was a big crowd\nFinally he pushed the last person that was in front of him and he regretted doing that because right in front of him on the ground was a man and a woman all bloodied beaten\nTo death and he cannot take this away from his memory his heart was beating so fast and he clutched his books again and went back to the street and went to his school\nUnable to take this image out of his mind in his class when he reached all the boys were laughing and playing and throwing things at each other\nAnd he just sat there remembering that image\nOf what he had just seen finally around forty to fifty minutes later the teacher walks in and he immediately went to the chalk board and took the chalk and he's like okay boys all take out your books today the are going to read this chapter and he turned towards the students\nAnd my father saw that his front of his shirt was full of ...\nIt's nice to death and he was part of the murders that he had seen on the street and he had come back after that to educate all of them they had given him the one feeling for age that he had carried with him all of his life\nFrom the moment that he put me on his shoulders to this moment where he fought for me to uh to not to put my life in risky actually in his heart desired for me to keep doing it every time I fought with him he desired that I should fight harder with him to keep my fight\nSo hungry to talk to her father about the money she really wanted to marry David ... however bringing both of their families together was a bit tricky\nInterestingly his family is extremely sweet and my family's it's extremely sweet but then my family's trying to paying some very mean things about his mother\nAnd his mother started saying some really mean things about my family and they were sitting on two different sides of the world and saying all these things without even seeing each other down seeing a photo if each other they just knew that this can happen this marriage can happen\nFor what reason both families didn't know why and two thousand fourteen I had a talk in Italy when it\nAnd I decided that I'm going to bring my family there and ask David to bring his family we're going to have them meet each other and they said all the main things they wanted to say than in front of each other [laughter] so when they all came to Italy one night before that'd be canceled their hotel rooms and\nBooked a small air BNB and put them in that place as soon as they arrived\nAnd started on our most awkward it's time for life\nThis one week they spend they were sitting right next to each other and they had been saying ...\nFearful and harsh things for each other in their homes now everyone was silent and so\nSlowly conversation started and all of those conversations I have to say started over ... that my mom made and within three days of this meeting they actually started realizing that oh my God we're all human they there's so many similarities\nThan there are differences and that is where we got engaged in Venice, Italy and soon our wedding was planned\nIt sounds like a scene from Hollywood Roman columns front [laughter]\nNow there's a photo of head on our website and ... don't forget you can touch with anything you might have missed and also subscribe to the outlook put cost so stay tuned we'll be back in a
