I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we have to say yes to news production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be produced\nThe world should really be towards the euro zero climate guessing Michelle can convince was well I think we have to see it on a great to scale because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on cold in the works\nBut it or not oil we're talking about oh yeah that's\nMy point is that if you have placed coal plants root for example of gas\nOr even oil there will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener refers to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with and when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agreement society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually if yeah doable\nCrystal from this in this movement of competition it probably don't make sense then to join in the ... because I actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited how long are camped here and others can argue that gets full replacing coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's a tragedy and we've had over a hundred and taste expiration within the parents the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and ah\nIf I can draw on a couple of find out what's next sense and and I came back a few years later and my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said now China should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to the international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in office for last\nWeek and it was a summary of the whole conference it was saying that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today I told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't afford\nTo making a plan to get off that feels good stuff\nI Would look at the time frame because college but says well it could be dream up to twenty Seventy yeah it will it will be like that if you base your numbers on I eat a international Energy Agency does have to still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noisy globally so we have to replace production\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green\nGay or at the same time we have to address CCS into view because carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and use it as both a central themes in the transition into\nBut not one of which have successfully than no trial yet again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to\nThis is one of the great things we could use our universe to do for the algae was from the burned see is like another Norwegians big stack them up on each other under thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution there is a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we're\nKind of you wants to come back and she is definitely important and we are in a situation in Norway led effort political party actually agree on is what makes a yeah what we need a lot on cash a story and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take a call them for the environment and and put it away the underground all under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that\nTechnology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think technology it's a matter of making it profitable\nAnd making it possible for companies to actually use and the government in no way are shifting government so it's been quite a lot with a lot of money to try to make that tough but fair is\nGetting down to the details again and the south has been focused on in order for Twenty years I think that also I needed to challenge the politicians here with a greater sense I guess I don't think when you were saying it's religion is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm in doing the climate change and if\nWe're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we don't have time for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you pleased to less than what you think it's a program or if you have any idea what the topic ... the real story at BBC dull Kendall UK and you can subscribe to the ... such a BBC the real story ... stop [noise]\nDistribution of the

I think he would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFurther than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students asked for it\nCan cause ... fault no love this is the opposite to the children I mean you have the development in the uh the merit to him a business so I mean this is something we have to strive to shift to a hundred degree and shift to you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo stand out in the parents see and I don't think it's necessarily get that nor they go to Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nIt does it does seem to go to the carbon browsing on if you see the court and Brazil has been originally to summer\nIt is a totally different picture coming up now so if the carbon prices high in Europe God's will exclude cos if do you mean by that call them price the price you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy by\nUm there's a market inside Europe and the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe too low cost when those price was starting to rise then you go to will push out cold not push up renewables\nFailed and we'll just have to understand that renewable and gas are competing nobody in Germany they are afraid they'll be able to carve approaching no but also the way the energy system works and seen through nibble energy much more cost efficient\nWhen it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are\nThey are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean obviously Norway can't we can't take Russia place when it comes to to get an exporter of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independence and are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're gonna keep exporting gas to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments but\nBut this is about what kind of view do we have for Europe ... twenty states and Europe committed to have zero come get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector off the twenty fifth day but that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way relatively poor country in the Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people in my class or the way in which treats such as ... as they get involved and international affairs and you know had peace deals and so on\nIf it was tough on sometimes get or other to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a a big ... independence this country that's going to keep it well\nSome level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you you painting a far too short picture because no it was a will for states before ... came\n... made a welfare state based on industry on hydro power on maritime shipping so\nWe may develop a state long before we discovered oil and gas remember your along the coast in Europe or the has been the only place in Europe which hasn't been any comment during history because we're always has easy accessible proteins\nSo we built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food going on and thank God we didn't have an ability we we have a military inside\nLooking a lot at the history and one important objective and an incentive is supposed to keep a moderate pace of extraction\nAnd let me hit that limit set set in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight but triple production but in his tenure and then the tens yes afterwards they almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry is I Would say in many ways it's sort of became patrol independent states\nThat we also have this workforce that they can use for other purposes so I think tying ourselves to type late to oil we should ...\nBut but I guess I think what ... is somehow psychologically had allowed no way to punch above its weight can\nI think we could just up the oil and gas tomorrow and it wouldn't have anything to do with our views on ourselves because that means yours are anyhow [laughter] I mean we have we have a well first states that's actually very clever because we have this big fund we use money from that fund\nTo pay for our running bills not from the oil and gas industry directory itself so for our everyday living and the for the political system for decided to solve it wouldn't have anything to do all of them of course we will lose if your income\nBut it would be very very stupid because in the European Union in the world they have to increase coal emissions because they would lose no reaching gas so that was my main points are now I'm so I'm back to that [laughter]\nVery good morning she welcomes news the on the
