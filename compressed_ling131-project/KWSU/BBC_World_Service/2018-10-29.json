soon as I get up and I tried to make it as a visual as possible in one and then I signed up to them and a hundred percent a hundred the article I Love that idea\n[laughter] I'm just saying I I don't

decision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that I've definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore um\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening process until you just can't you almost it's subliminal you know you almost like you don't even hear the lyrics and the more you just feel it\n[noise]\nSometimes it's good to just sit with that you know if you count the problem is sometimes you get a truck and I like when you get a treatment by the end of the week and it's like a It's Wednesday and friday you know so\nThat's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market well maybe I'm just not as popular as director Kenny but\nYou know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly\nBut more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors so that's a little tricky because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many imaging who knows\nI recently pitched on the cot is a ... and I knew that there was some big guns in the ... pitching on that project and I knew I was lucky to be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in that ... busy schedule I'm not sure they had time to talk to [laughter]\nSo I just had to come up with an idea and like what's the best you know I didn't quite nail at that time but that's the part of being a doctor but\nThere is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success show but maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artist and you ... it can potentially be more competitive out that because I feel there's a lot of directors out their\nBiggest guilty you if you're fishing for me all the energy project [laughter] that's a lot of what you need to watching of course is amazing artist but then I think I'm lucky by the time to come to me that kind of made up their mind but then again it's not genes look beyond\nYou listening to the conversation I guess we'll to what we need music video directives king of ... and Kenny ... from Nigeria so you Bruce\nCan you think ... ... where you have to navigate accommodating holding on to create position and I knew him and you say that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points for some people in a little bit differently so it just it does me here\nYou got to understand initially in the beginning it wasn't that way 'cause I mean I have to put myself that especially being a woman in the industry and competing with of course drops going America's male dominated field and met at the end it's crossed off starting off\nOn television too I was the printing press than that now want it to be the girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had was\nEvery time you get the opportunity you have to knock it out the park the first ever project that I did one official project and I did music video it was a music video for an award ceremony at I Won the one of them\nAnd they had a a song that was going to be the theme song and then they had a lot of the big names pitching for it and I'm like you know what to do it is not like you know I'm a direct analogy\nBut yeah I mean that's what we want you to start when you come out of state and things like that and I mean I'm not just from one thing I had one day I had a dream about the concept to try to be a visual as possible and I sent it to the guy that you know who's running the show\nAnd he called me I was like actually love this treatment and bite off your and like that's a I caught that one and I mean that can make a decision that point in time I could you know what how about you do this\nHow about you don't pay me\nGave me definitely what I Need to execute this project\nAnd you get a better job of course you're going to have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point that got that chalk eventually to position lifestyle and it wasn't having said that I looked at the park I might not have gotten more boosted tuition but that is the only project and I had to pitch for it\nBut then one I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a business card to you know a lot of people call me dinner even though I'm a girl so [laughter] because it in the music video and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's been\nOkay can we talk about how much are charging [laughter] I'm very expensive very kind of hold exactly clear you don't have to give me the exact figure to give me a sense of how much you're charging\nOffend it depends on the project that things on charges that things are charging\nFor nothing at all that but I lead me the money when he came to me my money to live a little bit too much for\nThem I really loved the the project I wanted to be parts of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in a particular project might not have lightened my pocket at that point in time when I was probably made me the most money down the line because people are things that go on I needed to work in this project\nI saw him with an expertise are going to be given to me I think what they can get at you as well now I mean can you give me a sense of how much he's challenging\nIt's funny because actually my family has not increased because it does a rule of thumb that older actors get ten percent of\nBudget isn't what would be typical budget I mean can you give me an example of the budget or we took him out of hand hundred thousand US dollars are we talking about ten thousand US dollars\nIt can be that it can be either um let's say a low budget project is around ten thousand oh and that means that direct to get a thousand dollars but that would be like a month what sorry you would get more working at a supermarket [laughter] because\nA matter of hours you put into a project where you drop everything and literally just do that you're not making much per hour but if you're working on a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollar project you can end up with a little bit of caution and pocket\nWhen you see the dynamic tempted and what does that mean I tend to sign of the total budget so who gets the budget well normally the budget comes from the label can get in your experience how a male and female artist treated differently by their record labels\nWell in my experience and this is obviously general conversation doesn't apply to everybody of what we thought it really depends on the artists and like how much they already have to bring to the table\nBut if it's somebody who has to be young and like a little bit lost and not really sure and that stupid talented and have an amazing voice then maybe the songwriting needs a little bit of collaboration with other riders so it it it you know that's when the label get really involved and I've noticed that it definitely happens a lot more women than men\n\nIs six o'clock in London and I welcome to news day

hundred and eighty people playing disappeared into the sea shortly after taking off from the Indonesian capital Jakarta and a search and rescue effort is now under way up and speaking to our correspondent charisma funny\nAnd the last hour and a half or so vessels that the Indonesian search and rescue agency owns have reached the area where officials believe the plane had crashed into those waters off the coast of cut out long ah which is not too far away from Indonesia's capital city Jakarta where the plane originally took off from\nWhat Ted the section rescue agency which is responsible for these sorts of operations\nIn Indonesia what they've been able to say it's currently they believe they found debris from the aircraft as well as possessions that they believe belonged to those on board but at this point they still haven't found any survivors they both sent helicopters to scour the seas\nIn the nearby areas to look for any people and\nI understand that the crew had asked to return to base shortly before the crash or the rescue officials or any fills in Indonesia reading anything into this as to the cause of the crash well\nAnd obviously that's also something that they're looking for what officials have said is that they believed that the plane crashed some thirty to forty meat is into the sea so they're looking for any remnants of the airplane one aviation analyst told me earlier today\nThat from the flight data that he's analyzed so no official confirmation of this analysis I I have to add but what he's been able to analyze he says that the plane was traveling at a very very high speed when it made him packed with the water it's not clear what that would have done to the condition of the airplane\nBut he also added that from the flight data that he analyzed the plane looked like it was in trouble from the very beginning he said that it had struggled to find some sort of\nLevel balance from the point that it took off now\nThose reports that you were talking about the pilot had asked to turn around soon after takeoff that's being reported in the local media we don't have any official confirmation of that yet all officials have said though is that they will continue to look for that flight data recorder which hopefully will reveal more information about why this happened\nEncouragement give us an idea what do we know about line air and their safety records well lion air\nIs Indonesia's biggest budget and line it's the airline that you would typically take to travel from one part of the archipelago\nTo the other it has hundreds of flights every single day but it also has had a very patchy safety record I think it would be fair to say I was in Indonesia a few years ago covering the crash of ally in air flight\nWhich crashed in Bali luckily for everybody on board miraculously in fact there were no casualties from that particular incident but\nThe safety record of this airline has certainly been spotty to say the least over the last several years however an aviation analyst have also said to me that\nLion has taken safety most seriously over the last few years and has invested in safety procedures and that's been a statement that's come in from the company itself saying that they are working in full cooperation with the Indonesian authorities to find\nAnd doing Thirty years he remained like this to the point that when we had\nThese car wash up ... basically swept away a great part of the political establishment he was one of the most vocal voice against the workers' party that was touched by corruption\nGiving him an edge and this hour of someone that could represent a something new\nSo do you think this vote for him was actually a vote for Mr both an hour or with a vote against the leftist workers' party\nI think it's partially a vote for ... above anything else they vote of rejection towards the workers' party and he was the candidate stepped in ... the most and in the most efficient manner does rejection towards the workers' party\nThey are also many concerns that some people have for example he expressed\nAbout ... what is his presidency going to mean with all of these comments and concerns that people have\nOkay I think that all those concerns are valid deans world pollen remarks\nProbably from an individual who never thought that he wanted to reach where he did a I Believe that the president institutions Cindy president political environment too strong enough to avoid and to prevent\nThat ideas like this are transformed into public policies and I'll do these remarks are are terrible I believed it up hardly they can represent anything practical in terms of a presidency because of the strength of their president legislative and judiciary system [noise]\nNow those who voted for him but as a vote against the workers' party justify that a single really want a better economy from Brazil and he's our best option for that well\nShe gained a lot of strength and support particularly with the president market when he chose total kid just to be his ministry of finance public as as an economist that is very respected in Brazil and if someone were very liberal ideas of how to conduct the economy\nSo she was able to bring these trends and also twin boarded the possibility of economic recovery and economic growth in Brazil\nYou advise companies in Washington about Brazilian issues but I'm just wondering in your conversations what are you telling them or they encouraging signs are already warning in about something\nWhat I always tell them is that was always a parliamentary system disguised as presidential new system\nOr the president parliament is probably the most powerful parliament in the empire of Latin America\nSo the key decisions they go through the parliament so the key aspect to observe is the relationship between the executive between both ... and his coalition babies do the indicators that these relationship gives we gave us a\nDa da Da Nang six months for when you go because uh if his relationship starts to tremble a little bit to show some lack of communication then they must be concerned about the ability of the government to deliver\nCapitol yeah I'd I'd go at their Brazil analysts on that big win at four giant ... that country's new president but also big challenges had [noise]\nA\nCouple of years as being what feels like endless bad news about plastic pollution with pictures me floating\nBusinesses accounting for twenty percent of plastic packaging produce politically assigned a commitment to get rid of the so called one use plastic in the next seven years that's plastic the huge one time and then just go rattles\nNow one country that has a very real interest in this case the Seychelles which relies on his blue season Christine Blasey Ford Taurus donors but which is struggling with growing mountains of plastic some put you sit home much of it by those tourists and some which\nFlipped over the safe from other countries I spoke to him in some ... vice president of the Seychelles weed out the conference with the announcement was made this morning\nLast year we joined the Seventy two thousand tons of waste and about ... percent on this is plastic waste so you will appreciate the manager of the problem we consume plastic but we did not produce any\nAnd yet we have such a large amount of plastic we also received a large amount of the marine debris\nLending on a show is coming from other countries\nAnd other regions that is affecting a pristine beaches\nAnd also and they own a coat refund receive is unacceptable for the health and the Cleveland ... reefs and our beaches in line with us tourists they care image\nI look at one recent report from the ... news agency saying that a vote on ... picked up one point two tons of debris on the beaches are just one island or south ... island I'm easily social thing as well as harming the environment is pushing tourists away something so many people depend on their livelihoods\nBut they're not pushing tourists that women they have the potential pushing pushing tourists away but I must say that we have a number and you as a mirror of NGOs and I'm happy to announce that the U.S out very much part of it they are aware and conscious of the need for us to protect the\nBeach uh sees our water from the ethics so there is a constant battle by the NGOs\nOr to support the government is doing to read a country of the plastic that we know ourselves for just about that lend up on our beaches\nScience majors just being an ounce to get rid of the single use plastics a plastic container say they're trying to use one and can't be recycled how much difference do you think that will make to you\nWhen it's when they make 'em a lot of a difference because we we fight we bear the brunt and only if we have a twenty percent on those president ... joined up I think it's the beginning yeah\nLike a massive problem every Janet begins with a very small steps we have done exactly that and we have a twin and people that like minded by what joined it and I think the effects are far reaching\nBeyond the train the deepest and to have a who have joined in and I think there is a lot for us to get from those we are sure that others will join me because we all appreciate\nThat plastics affecting that half of our planet we'll appreciate the fact that he does not only profit that should shift humankind but also how we protect the health of our planet which is the only one

round the world and realize that in effect was no different and my interest in plastics come from my interest in how the economy functions how we use materials within our economy and talked packaging is incredibly high volume thirty like value as a material and a huge amount of it and they sat in the ... the very different route\n[noise] how the initial foundation going to work with the stomach and in the future to try and reduce that\nWell the goal of the foundation is trying to make the transition to a secular economy which is an economic model which differs\nFrom my current on our current as very lenient tighten might disposed we take them at their lack the ground to make something after that and then the majority gets thrown away and plastic packaging is a great example within a secular economy you turn a straight line and you turn it into a cycle that you design the economy so that waste is\nEffectively designed out you keep products materials and use for as long as possible and you also have the potential to be generating natural systems what we're doing around plastic packaging\nMembers those three areas it's about being regenerative restarted it's about eliminating the packaging we don't need it by innovating around the packaging that we do so that is one hundred percent recyclable comfortable or we usable and\nThen the fed area it's such like that material once

specific\nSet of targets together with the organization that the government to the regions and also some of the biggest companies in the world we have we reckon twenty percent of the\nPlastic packaging world by volume signed up to the commitment already so these kind bound targets that everyone has agreed on we don't have all the answers to how to get that yet but we do have these Tom time
