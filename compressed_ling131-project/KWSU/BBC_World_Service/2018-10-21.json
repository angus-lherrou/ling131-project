when he vacation far away from home [noise] British explorers and even Teddy Roosevelt carry books have Shakespeare with them when\nThey entered into Africa in the nineteenth century and Shakespeare's presence is still very much alive there today is pleased that translated into Swahili and South Sudanese Arabic to become a point of cultural pride permitted in East Africa\nEdward Wilson really rough to Kenya and he now teaches Shakespeare at Cambridge dispersed the universal appeal Shakespeare in his book Shakespeare in Swahili Edwards thanks for being here thanks for having me on right\nNow there is so fascinating to think of Shakespeare breaking out of western culture especially in the East Africa can you first of all tell us about your passion for Shakespeare in your work at Cambridge\nI have been upset district space and say you know a fairly young age I spent my childhood in Kenya and wasn't one of these\nChildren who had a ... book the entire time I spent my childhood off pretending to be here as rather than reading about a but certainly um since my teen years I've seen a difficulty of Shakespeare and I went on to\nRead that University in and then teach at Cambridge but it wasn't until I happened upon this project that I managed to connect phase two very disparate parts of my life\nYou know the subtitle of your book Shakespeare in Swahili that is in search of a global poet it's kind of like elevating Shakespeare to be more than just a a a hero of western literature but global how could he be global without being merely cultural imperialism\nWell I think a part of the story is about cultural imperialism um it's about a British rapists\nIt's what few people realize is that very early on in his history Shakespeare became detached from Britain from being simply a British possession\nOn and was translated into a wide numbers of languages so for instance one of the great discoveries in this book was to find that Indians who had taken Shakespeare from British culture back in India but had been proved type to build the railways in East Africa in the early twentieth century\nHad extraordinary culture all performance of Shakespeare in Mumbai in nearly twenty century I at one point Shakespeare was being performed a more a month ... southern in London's west that and\nThese were you know glorious Lee irreverent productions much like Shakespeare's own day you know Shakespeare was that was released his check for ... as a matter of the state has to do what's necessary to get bumps on seats to entertain the audience and these were very much\nShakespeare plays but taken and remade um speak to the people who are performing them in Mumbai in nearly twenty century so I think you know as long as things that become\nPetrified as long as we you know we didn't put things on a pedestal and insist that they don't change in order to understand them in New ways and set in the Shakespeare cannon has come in in very very different places and the way he originally wrote the place\nYou know that's an amazing image immigrant laborers from India working on a real way in Kenya adapting Shakespeare plays to entertain themselves and make life jolly it's another example of our Shakespeare\nSort of a appeals to people that several levels were these players when they're used by for instance immigrant labor is from India in East Africa\nAre they adapted to fit the culture or the amped up to be more entertaining a on their level or are they just straight translations of Shakespeare like we would no\nUm no I mean they they are adopted again there's a wonderful twelfth night where instead of being shipwreck off the coast of Bohemia as happened in Shakespeare's play the opening scene sees a train wreck which sweet stay are the main characters down or with a into a movie called kingdom and obviously that's kind of speak to people\nWho are themselves working on a very dangerous set of uh of of railway construction projects\nYou know the hamlet settle on mood called battlement ... Juliet in a wonderful Romeo and Juliet adaptation and against spoiler alert here since anyone who's never see for me and Juliet or instead of stabbing herself at the end of the play she uses a poisonous snake\nA North Dakota which kind of tone or into cars\nWonderfully fertile reimagining of the plane and one that packed our houses on the U.S has with\nFive hundred people every night of the week I'm not these corrugated on tracks in a fledgling city a mom pass on you know I think it really brings alive the cultural vibrancy of east Africans if he's even in this in this period\nOr guest on travel with Rick Steves Edward will lead he's a professor of literature in Cambridge and the author of Shakespeare in Swahili land\nIn search of a global poet Edward is it safe\nTo say I mean you're focusing on the East Africa but would this be\nAfrica as an example of how all over the world Shakespeare is adapted to local cultures and the writing might be tweaked so you're not going to be stabbed you're going to be killed by a poisonous snake if that's what happens in your culture and I got to be on a ship or it could be on a train wreck but is that happening all over the planet\nObsolete they're extraordinary Shakespeare traditions in India in Russia Japan\nAnd China I think this East African story is extraordinary because there are so many different periods in which Shakespeare is tweaked in different ways he used as this kind of um this ambulance to protect the explorers he's used by that mission raised to create a written culture of Swahili language\nIs now a spoken by a hundred million people he's translated into Swahili he's you know he's performed by these Indian parents and then you know in the late twentieth century he becomes a real flash points for talking about the extent to which\nThese countries in the aftermath of colonialism want to be open to the culture of the people who had been colonial open ...\nI'd like to get a little more into that but first of all a Edward defined Swahili land East Africa\nYes they're Swahili land is not a terribly commonly used to but it's one which hopefully capture has a set of countries Kenya Tanzania Uganda part of the Congo Malawi which Swahili is either the main or one of the major languages\nThis also icy region was governance of the kind of single entity by the British colony so the reason why they speak Swahili is because the British colonial offices and mission rage landed on the coast which is why I asked what he has spoken Swahili it's\nKind of very Arabic influenced bound to language and as the colonial governments moved inland and ah they would damned if they were going to speak I learned more than one language so they made everyone else learns why he has they moved in\nThey don't have to learn all the different tribal languages and because of the British imperialism so widely as much bigger in Africa today than it would have been otherwise\nPrecisely so it it is a legacy of collect list but on the other hand it's also I like to see that it's created to shed culture between all of them are African culture within one of these countries in East Africa\nNow you talked about the missionaries using Shakespeare is what is nineteenth century missionaries and Shakespeare have in common when it comes to sway\nThe main character in this story the ... cold ed wood who was the mission ... Central Africa sent out from Britain she arrives in Zanzibar in Eighteen sixty seven and he is admission ran it his job to try and convince the locals to Christianity\nBut he sees that as central to listen to create electricity so he actually spends a lot of the time\nTrying to understand local cultures translating Swahili ... into English\nAnd trying to provide things for local schoolchildren ... people learning to read to read in Swahili so one of the first things printed in Swahili he is a translation and the off chance and Mary lambs tales from Shakespeare called ...\nPrinted on this little hand press in the Eighteen sixties and it goes on to be this foundational taxed schoolchildren in Kenya and Tanzania to almost a century after that\nSo missionaries want to look for people to be able to read the Bible and you know promote their face and in order to do that people had to be literate and listeners had to understand their culture and their culture need a better understanding of the missionaries culture and Shakespeare helped pave the way\nYeah so the idea I mean if you are either ... or you believe that won a gold has created old people and that means that old people must have some kind of shed language of beauty that they can commuting in an overseas Shakespeare was held up as this this great genius\nWho in ... because he wasn't terribly well educated had access to a kind of universal notions of beauty that allowed him to speak this very pure language of beauty and so the assumption was that wherever you if you translate to Shakespeare into those languages they would also be able to appreciate\nHave that's one more reason or he could be the global poet he talked in universal terms of beauty and love and humanity\nThat's one of the ways in which that anyone Shakespeare goes out to East Africa eating at a desk thinking about his universe listen thinking about him or having this kind of blood\nWell certainly was raised in Kenya by his British and American parents lived outside of Nairobi and worked as conservationists today and we're teaching Shakespeare in Cambridge returned to East Africa or why the works of Shakespeare continue to be important in the region beyond the years of British colonial Edwards website is Edward Wilson Lee dot\n[noise]\nThirty four I travel between the sort of\n[noise]\nThank you [noise] gun bones age [noise]\nMore than a decade Iceland and focusing especially on a cyber music [noise]\nHe's fall Kevin at a team from Katie XP radio in Seattle head to Reykjavik to broadcast live from Iceland Airwaves music festival\nPool has traveled to each corner of the island nation that has made many local friends he's tapping their studio now to share his passion for one of the hottest traveled destinations\nAnywhere these days and it's music scene Kevin thanks for joining us thanks so much for having me Rick appreciate that of all places to take a radio crew to broadcast live [noise] why would you choose Iceland and why be gone back for so many years in a row well\nOne reason is they have an incredible music scene here it's amazing [noise]\nA little history on K XP were a Seattle based radio station with a global audience and we're committed to finding a discovery in great music no matter where it's being created\nWe had been going to music festivals in the United states like south by southwest in Austin, Texas and see I'm Jay in New York City but uh the first trip to Iceland as a station I really wanted to make a point to to decay XP would travel to the\nFarthest corners of the earth to find a great music to share with our listeners worldwide really you know music is like travel in a way to write and our belief is that if we can harness the emotional power of music and bring people together\nAnd helped create a more tolerant and understanding world as we get to have those experiences during music can get to understand each other through\nVarious different types of music and uh you come to realize that the world is a lot smaller place uh sometimes we think it is even when it's far away and there are different dimensions of cultures that you can use and your entree into a more intimate connection with that culture can be cuisine that can be art\nIt can be music caps on me and a music certainly it's almost like a shape but it's international language you can sit in a pub in Ireland or or I suppose in a small concert hall in in Reykjavik and feel like you're celebrating the same thing with local people absolutely\nAnd I and I think that's part of what drives K XP and to your point you don't even necessarily need to understand the language to be able to field emotional quality or what's being conveyed in the music there is that magic spark some time\nSame weights link and I just I Walk out of there just marveling at what a match it's hard to explain that these are the magic the ways to make travel transformational really\nTransformational or is it is such a great word to describe a\nWhen you have those kinds of experiences and for me personally that happens a lot with music when it when it all comes together and not tell you one of the reasons we went to Iceland or I went to Iceland for the first time was\nI wanted to go somewhere to experience the summer solstice could have done that in a whole bunch of different places but there was a band called secret Rowse and they uh had an album called I'll get to us here and that\nWas so magical when I first heard it and [noise]\nI don't even know what it is it's so hard to put into words I had never heard any music so beautiful that as soon as I sat and listen to that album I was like I Want to go to the land this music from where that came yeah I Want to try and understand there's something about that if I listen to some music fair for Greek\nIf I Want to go to the fjord\nAnd look at the view where his cabin was when he was inspired to write that he has a music is sometimes so unfair you want to be translated it\nThen you want to go to the to the place from where it blossom [noise] guess music can sometimes it inside travel okay so you're organizing this now in a sense with a passion for Iceland in particular yeah so the first trip I went to was before we started broadcasting and again\nI don't know if you've had this experience but it was two thousand five and it was so remarkable and it's so far exceeded my expectations that I actually did not want to go back [laughter] oh you didn't want to go back because he thought you'd be ruining it ruining ... yeah I\nI you know it's so hard to replicate something really about it yeah if I go back with a TV crew and who doesn't come out where the magic amateur last year was incredible do it again\nYeah in terms of terrorism and so I did not want to go back but I was so into it and and kept talking about the music of ice and on my radio show I ended up hooking up with their trade commissioner and general counsel in here in North America leaner good Johnson\nAnd that to a series of events ended up culminating in us actually going to Iceland broadcasting live and I had to do raise scouting locations trip before\nAnd I've been fourteen or Fifteen times now in every time has been a deep rich experience for different reasons\nAnd we would not keep going back in broadcasting live if there was an incredible music year over year over year which is remarkable for a country of three hundred and twenty five thousand people but it is this music\nIt's a bit of both now where the music fest we broadcast from it's called the airways and it's a showcase for Icelandic Antarctic\nBands new and emerging bands from the Nordic countries along with a beautifully curated selection of international band so it was a gathering of people from all over the world\nBut the focus is Icelandic and I think what's happening now do musically because of the Internet is were all able to hear music from all over the world so musicians and creative people who are curious become naturally knows hires\nThat's a boon for music culture and internationally and it's probably the benefit of the Internet a lot of people don't don't appreciate and don't take advantage of like they might be [noise]\nThe land the fire and I punched his wings by the way as a source for innovative contemporary music\nI guessed right now in travel with Rick Steves is Kevin ...\nHe's the program director of Seattle's noncommercial key ESP radio ten I'm using post on a weekday afternoon\nKevin sharing way he traveled to the Iceland Airwaves every November in Reykjavik here what many bands and musicians are up to each year\nYou'll find links to the festival hand to Kevin radio show at ... dot com crash radio [noise]\nKevin when we're talking about this listener's experiences his attendees experience this music appreciation experience [noise]\nI don't think of Iceland is a place with great intimate Venus I mean I've had magic experiences in pubs Oregon and wonderful beer garden and so on but what is the venue like does that contribute to it in Iceland or is it just I'm a concert hall\nSo Iceland Airwaves is eight years multiple shows and events happening each night over four nights\nIn various different venues and sometimes not even a because any space that could be a cool place to host a ban becomes one that they've got things like uh the harp a concert hall which is an amazing facility that is where\nAll that hard on them all I've been there that's a matter of pride for Reykjavik really is this your concert standing right every Scandinavian capital seems to really prioritize for a suitably creative and rooted in local values kind of a wonderful concert hall\nI think all the stone is is about ... ...\nIt's a I think they got more books published per capita than anywhere on earth potential vibrant music scene is as you're tuned into with all sorts of of creative genres\nAnd lots of creative people have you thought about what makes Iceland a punch above its weight or ... that sort of phrase or because it's a tiny island and it's in darkness most of the year [laughter] what what is it about it that has so much creativity\nMan that's that is a great question and music journalists have been trying to break the code on that one right like why does this for a small country have such an incredible music scene and why is it so creative and\nAnd I think it's a whole bunch of different factors in fact I had the the president of ice on the on my show uh all of her grandson and\nWe were talking about Iceland's assets you know you've got geothermal energy and the knowledge around that you've got the fishing industry you've got data mining but he said that the most valuable asset of ice under the creativity of the people\nAnd he sort of tied that into again the legacy or the lineage of the the saga is and how storytelling had to be a way that the history was told\nYou know dating back a thousand years and that sort of everyone was a storyteller and he said that to art and culture and Iceland was really a democracy of culture in that everyone was encouraged to participate in at some point everybody had to buy and telling the stories right he related is to music and saying that\nYou know everybody can create music and if you have something valuable to contribute it will be embraced him by valuable to contribute he meant something new and different ...\nAnd you mix it in with the saga heritage yes when people had to do things in the oral tradition yes and a music is the horse that the poetry rides on\n[noise]\nMaybe see well Seventy six hours GMT welcome to weekend way to Judy America coming up Saudi Arabia under pressure to for the

if the west actually took the boats that does not propping up the Saudi regime\nWhat I mean that's what's happened in two thousand and three with Iraq and that led to the creation of ISIS and we're still dealing with that I think it'd be much worse if the same thing is repeated with Saudi because it's not only Sunni extremists who wouldn't exploit this but the Shiite extremists\nThe

five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats I'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years and the vote has been bloody Britain many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul\nDozens are dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is a reporter Jennifer ... she is in Kabul thanks for being with us going to be here and then there\nWere people able to turn out to vote in large enough\nOr did the violence keep them away\nYou know despite threat from Islamic state and from the Taliban is more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we really only seen numbers from the big cities and if the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attacker the suicide bomber here in Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by policemen he detonated his exploits\nOne polling center outside of ... city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the outskirts of cobble abroad his armed men in he's a candidate and he tried to prevent\nOther people from getting to the polling station so not by far the cleanest elections the Afghan governance announced its arrested a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs though this time around is the number of women running right over four hundred what will just mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province uh but I think that the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that\nHas held Afghanistan back and it was really interesting to see election observers\nAt the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake in these elections\nThe fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghans trying to change things and just\nBriefly what is it signified of the vote was held after so very long it's always important to remind people that this is a country in conflict to conflict that the United states is involved and\nIt is and there was a lot of controversy about whether the votes should be held at all but Afghan officials were adamant and international officials were adamant that they were going forward and vote and I think today they might be happy with their decision more than three million of eight point\nEight million registered voters coming out there trying to show that the that Afghanistan is making progress\nAnd the battle insurgents around the country the Taliban are resurgent Islamic state was against the vote and yet still Afghans came out to exercise their civil right\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the library of

parents are ... or the development of this joy playing out in the middle east at the proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\n... statement supporting a both Saudi Arabia and John King so one of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of a lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissidents\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air among those are members of civil society\n[laughter] trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist up without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east an American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think liberated possible particularly with the Saudis and I would say that they played it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well and activist and the others and so there clearly not the beacon of liberal democracy in the region\nBut they've been able to play this role of of basically defending a you know uh this one man Joe Biden and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price uh from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey a what would what game are they playing I mean why exposed Jamal ... she's a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated jet\nOr they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange the native investment investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther eyes or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\nI and and just briefly are we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to impose sanctions next week and continue\nNot more money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much thank you\nOn September twenty six twenty four teams students from a teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of water\nAlthough there remains have never been found their deaths were very asleep blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups and the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist ... hadn't and this was published an exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the event was\nA fabrication in these official version they Mexican Government said that the army and they put it up all these they didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything ends ... what I have\nTo be known these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official ... is our ally is not to its ally [noise]\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the ... not jealous where not these about what was happening that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the ... not just is\nEven more I had reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if it up all these white chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean so yeah it was before that that\nSo the federal police and the army were chasing the students how would the students killed\n[noise] well that students arrive near while at the army the police they state police were waiting for them than their students decide to move to Boston where they were transferred dating\nTake more buses to go to the protest to Mexico City so they went to both the station\nDay to do that you both us and when their students were trying to escape ... will be spy buses from the ... when the army the police\nThen when they see by police and the staple east stock to shoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm they they're always at the end of that back way to process\nIt from ... to bust us disappeared all day for a three students\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses I'm to the people that were on those buses the students are on this plus has disappeared why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese last I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were targeting inside boss that's\nWhy you did that it did watch just to\nFill the two versus what exactly that to both is that the army and they said that police it starts to monitor it\nSeems to have a worse before I mean these two boats says why would they do both is where the students were traveling from school to why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students didn't know it for the army and they said that police they knew that [noise]\nSo the students\nAlmost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know what these guys that are really tragic it I see that they didn't know\nHow you know that heroin was hitting on that bus I was able to connect with one drug lord important drugs lark I was able to contact with one person that works for him and the west these uh informant\nDo we know who ordered the crime I mean it's been over a hundred arrests in this case do we know who actually said you know targeted these students in order to this to happen\nAccording with my investigation that there's a responsible of these crime wise that twenty seven battalion anyone\nIn particular decorum than died received a phone call from that there'll be ... or their ... you had to rescue my drugs I pay you for the you have to I don't know I don't why do you have to do I want my drugs that\nHave they've faced any consequences what if they said to to your findings [noise] even now the Mexican government is is that nagging in all that waste both peoples that day I mean they were present the real person that we're both on that prime are not in yeah\n\nUm trials Snyder with these
