are usually younger voters and they tend to to break Democrats but in this particular cycle that's accentuated I answer Democrats if these new voters do turn out and there are some times that they're going to be more likely to turn out really does give a boost to the Democrats in a district like the sweetest reaching out to voters from the mile campaign\nSign on the campaign will come down to

the uppermost in boats as mines I've been speaking to leave Maryland Gulf director of the Marist College poll on the front of a cruise and independent polling and election consultant first to see what issues does she think will help voters make up their minds I find the\nMost fascinating thing is that the polls suggesting that we have two completely different electorate the Republican electorate which is motivated now say they are motivated now by issues like immigration and the Democratic electorate which is focusing on much more traditional bread and butter issues like\nIn particular this year health care\nThat means that it had an election that is operating basically on two separate tracks\nAnd leave what difference might the pipe bombs and the outrage in Pittsburgh the mountain what difference might they makes you think\nThink there's a tone and the closing days with the campaign\nThat can move some of the voters who are on the fence we saw that in the presidential campaign after the ... letter and other things are going on in the last week where people moved into Donald Trump's direction I think right now this is the kind of issue that ... to ...\nAnything and this is not the kind of discussion President Trump would want going into the final week of a midterm campaign people are very concerned about what's going on and this affects people's outlook towards the stage of the country\nAnd bleed has the Republican Party come to terms with a Trump presidency I mean across the Republican Party\nBut I think it's interesting 'cause there's there there were the note Trump burst for quite a while they have pretty much vanished\nI think it's fair to say that this is Donald Trump's party when you look at the votes for key legislation you look at what Republicans are saying at worst they say well you know he's got some odd characters things that I Wish she didn't talk about so much or tweet about so much but the agenda I'm really solidly behind\nThere's very few Republicans who are distancing themselves\nOr who are facing election right now are reelection from Donald Trump I mean they they are really you know stepping in line to his administration and his presidency\nI was gonna say if I may there in relatively little difference and polling data\nBetween people who identify as Republicans and people who tell us that they voted for Donald Trump it's not as if for one group is any different from the other on in terms of their political views what we find is that Republicans in particular are taking their cues\nFrom President Trump and while they may not have\nAn opinion that matches his when an issue first emerges\nAfter a week or two they do in fact echo the Trump position so we've got Donald Trump effect is leading the party and reading those people who who voted for him two years ago on if I offer an add something about\n... we've had shootings in the United states and we had a lot of mass shootings over the years it does relatively liberal in the long run in terms of changing opinion about gun control about what to do about gun violence\nOn there's usually a short term effect it dissipates in in a surprisingly short amount of time a week or two so this coming ten days before an election it's hard to see whether or not it's going to have any meaning to voters when they go to the polls on next Tuesday\nUncovering what about Republican women because there are lots of things about what this president is alleged to have done\nIf they are loyal to the Republican Party\nI've spent a lot of time over the last few weeks looking at the relationship between gender and partisanship and how that affects came in and what seems to be the case is that Republican women and Republican men don't differ very much when it comes to opinion about Donald Trump they did not differ when it came to opinion about\nSupreme Court justice now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh where we see gender differences emerged can be very distinctive is among those people who identify which neither party on independent women are very different from independent meant\nYeah and I would add to that uh is clearly more about party than it is about gender when do you accept you know back critical group of voters and the basis of both parties are much lock stock and barrel behind her party's candidates that leaves these independent voters and especially independent women\nAnd independent women who may be in living in the suburbs who are\nThe ones who are if there is a swing group that's probably the group of voters that to zero in on\nWell then let's finish by talking about the Democrats we report quite a lot about changes in the Democratic party I'm much more progressive voices the kind of establishment Clinton I really losing the influence how do you see that Lee [noise]\nYou know [laughter] I think there were a couple of primaries that sort of got some headlines I'm not sure that we have any thing that's clear looking ahead to let's say twenty twenty at this point other than there's a lot of mobilization among the Democratic\nParty I don't think the Democrats at this early pick sides as to which part of them is going to dominate the process I think they're unified in their opposition to President Trump to the point\nIf the Democrats take control of the house of representatives um it's very likely that Nancy Pelosi will continue to be the leader of the party in the house and she is certainly identified as one of the old guard\nOn the other hand she's on her through a woman which is a distinction that may prove valuable in terms of her contest for house speaker for Democrats taken Trump\nJust a short also from each of you or how likely use it for the Democrats will take the house or even the Senate late [noise]\nI think that and I suspect cats will agree with that\nThis is like the Republican\nIs very likely that the national house vote is going to be clearly in favor of a Democrat but the way districts are drawn that may or may not result\nIn a Democratic majority in the house of representatives the Democrats harm it terrible time trying to reach a majority in front of it just because there are too many vulnerable red state Democrats for on the ballot this year\nAnd and very few Republicans who worked on the fact that Hillary Clinton carried so the reverse doesn't hold its just because of all the

a lot more people have been prevented from voting and fraudulent votes cast\nThat there are many many more people that are being blocked from the\nBalls than voted illegally and I think you have to scrutinize all of those cases very clearly to see if if there was actually fraud and and there's been a lot of really wild claims that had been made by people like Hans von Spakovsky so the bigger problem is that a lot of people can't participate in the election or choose not\nTo orange swayed from participating\nBecause the barriers that have been erected to the ballot box of\nWhatever didn't see how they actually do I think\nThere's been a lot of studies there's been numerous studies that have found for example that voter ID laws reduce voter turnout\nAnd that they reduced voter turnout most sharply among young voters first time voters of voters of color these are studies that have been done by academics in states like Wisconsin these are studies that have been done\nNationally by government agencies and places like Kansas and Tennessee I think if you look at the end ten\nOr Republicans have claimed on many different occasions that these laws have helped them politically that have help and carried key swing states like Wisconsin for example I and I think it also just makes sense that you know if you reduce people's access to the process that your people that are going to
