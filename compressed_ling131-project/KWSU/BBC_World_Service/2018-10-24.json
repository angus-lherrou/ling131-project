it's not just about having people involved in the system\nHe's having his volunteers and his supporters in effect running large parts of his campaign on their own if he does when it was suddenly than the big message across Washington that's right what better was doing win or lose is showing that you can run the campaign very differently than anyone else has thought possible\nAnd I think the true test of better or worse legacy will be\nHow different democratic presidential candidates try to emulate what he's doing mostly spending is thirty eight million plus on so far he has spent thirty percent of his money just on digital expenditures that means running ads on Facebook on Google\nOn recruiting other donors and supporters\nThat when he was a it was a similar tactic approach by the

on a percentage points also do you think that as opposed to the extent that fundraising is a symptom of sentiment a new CDC asked them to think the polls around\nThe polls that have been adapted so far in Texas I'm all university found that Ted Cruz's ahead by eight what I think the equation is whether or not better war can turn out voters that are not being picked up in the polls\nCan you reach voters that are not going to be picked up on in any traditional assumption of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that until November sixth and I think that Beto O'Rourke is making a good

shrimp [noise]\nThe Republicans led by the president himself have been leading their own major effort to Donald Trump remains a big fundraising drawers events like this one\nAnyway it is important to stress that well Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been better stalked from previous years which means that spending between the two parties they were old may end up being fairly even so how might\nThis translates into success at the polls does the money even matter that much Donald Trump ... under spent Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but still one\nMuch academic research over recent years just that expensive TV advertising campaigns are not always that influential and so does so how should campaign be focusing should they be spending an online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government and legal studies through his Wesleyan Media project tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so most candidates spend a lotta time raising a lot of money in order to be able to tie advertisements and to find all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you are running a campaign\n[laughter] well I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach older voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on our digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists\nUh what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very efficiently with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because that's where the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nDoes TV advertising they'll work\nMore messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently that poll numbers move in that direction so if you cannot advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day of the more likely that means you'll get more votes\nBut what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so that the spending that happens very early in a campaign you know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race all that much\nUh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spend so much money early in campaigns so that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of the euro viable campaign [noise]\nUm but at the end of the day campaign ads that are in small ways and and not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage if the election is likely to be close if it's a fifty fifty race\nAnd you lose by half a percentage point and that's because you decided not to spend the last you know half a million dollars on ads and you're going to be you know you're you're going to regret regret it and so that's why campaigns do what they do\nSo we're all basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks but [noise] ah votes as being absolutely bled with the TV's boats\nWherever they may be absolutely and voters consistently say that they don't like these things\nBut campaigns don't care because they they want to make their message known and they want to advertise their opponent and they don't want to leave anything on the table and so voters in in competitive\nDistricts in states should expect to see a whole bunch of advertising online and on TV and on the radio or in the next to the next ten

imagine the services\nWe were yelling at the water is the water's rising it's not stopping we're stuck in the elevator we may only have ten maybe Fifteen minutes left of time to breathe before the elevators completely submerged that night because of all the flooding there was Ninety eight percent more emergency calls than normal\nAnd the fire department or they weren't able to get a hold of them so nobody could confirmed that they were on their way and the same thing with the police the entire time we thought that nobody was even dispatched yet and by that by then the water was almost at our shoulder levels\nBut that one or two people that had the dispatches called partners comfortable Rand Barnett and comfortable Josh mcsweeney\nYeah we were right up some notes or we just finished a cold and just park the car and so just luck by timing you know that call came over\nIt was lock lucky because the comfortable with just a few blocks away and knock because they watch even meant to receive that cold they share a band radio frequency with another police division\nYeah so we share a band with twelve division which is our neighboring division\nSeeing something like okay this is the twelve division and then they give you the description of the event to exactly and the dispatcher that night said over the radio that the next school was not that then at the twelve division and\nTwo people trapped in the elevator it was a very different call you don't get that too often you may hear about them being trapped in the elevator but not when water is now rising through the elevator\nTypically are we don't have to take that call yeah like that that could happen\nThey didn't have to but the calls seemed so urgent and the building was spy shot so close by\nAnd so we hear the call we jump on it we can hear the dispatcher she's becoming more excited on the radio saying the water's rising it's going to rather quickly\nAnd so as we're going our thinking oh my gosh regular faster and faster so we started going lights and sirens when you got that what we're seeing fortunately there was a boat four or five people\nBy the elevators that are right there that are already trying to help out\nTo people in the building direct the police officers stairwell down to the basement\nI kind of an aside know those kind of funny as we're going there was one guy that was quite adamant for us\nWe should use the elevator you know [laughter] so few that gets working usually use it it'd be quicker or like I don't think we're going to use that elevator\nMisguided I feel like it might be a an obvious case in point as to why that'd be I don't know [noise]\nSo wisely the police officers choose the stats but the building is those flooded it that they can only just the the top of the door to the basement\nAnd I just said to ride them like am I looking at that right is that the door that we're looking at the top you know\nAnd then Ryan just looked at means flow has teams like well we got to go in and just really took off his belt and his best and then just started walking in the water [noise]\n\nThe offices are inundated with Nike smelly wars have bought are able to get into the basement and they went on to the elevator doors you\nCan hear them now panicking their police officers were drowning please help us\nWe heard people kind of a muscle talking on the other side of the elevator and I'm trying to find a way to open it and then we just start pulling on the door but\nIt's locked [noise] at this point how much had to wash everything from when you arrive [noise] the foot maybe on our side and so we kind of have to assume that was quite similar on the other side\nWe didn't even know at that point if they had enough time to get us out before we ran out of breathing space [noise] ah because they were struggling to opening [noise]\nThen comfortable by now goes to get across to help which opened the door the officers can barely reached the fluid that basically treading water ... been out on the playing against the strength of the door open fighting to strengthen the war\nGene then I tried wasn't budging so then I asked the two guys from the inside if they can remember which way the door open 'cause it could have been the middle it opens the rights I left side\nThey didn't know which way the elevator door open and I just remember thinking in my mind like I Am not going to die over a year left my right situation\nThat they could you know which way the dog\n... cat um had a good idea which way it open and then we we agreed because it it was the only way that it made sense because that's how panic and anxiety we had is that that we we didn't know which way the elevator doors are open normally when we got up to the salary that we use every day\nAnd I'm Wondering is that yeah I mean I'm sure everyone listening is going to think about that now [laughter]\nYeah remember jumping into back into the water and at this point the water was that about just at the bottom of my neck I yelled out to the police officers that I'm standing facing the elevator doors and the door opens to my left I'm facing the elevator doors open to my left and that's that's what I remember saying\nAnd so Ryan how to cope aren't just right away just went to the left side and uh poodles forced into it and uh she was able to pop it\n[noise] it was a thin [noise]\nWhen those doors open a that was the first one that I knew that if that were going to see your family's again [noise] get very difficult to explain the feeling like maybe\nOh sorry\nI'd say a combination of of both it said not any one one feeling but then it was also a feeling of finally as letting my survival instinct that adrenalin subside [noise] I did life guarding training as a child and I forgot how to swim for about three seconds\nAs I'm getting out of the elevator he's like I Can't\nI Can't swim can swim so Josh grabbed him and they ended up swimming to the door so we can agree with the basement [noise]\nIt's almost like I just let the police officer dragged me out because that was the first moment that I can let myself I'm relaxed like a whole body just sort of like a [noise] yeah [noise]\n\nIf they had arrived five or ten minutes later [noise] would you still be alive [noise]\n\nPlayed around with the idea of that I used to think about it in a you know in parallel universes what's what's going on with different versions of yourself from physics or quantum mechanics but I'm pretty sure that in some versions or I saw the other universes I'm I didn't make it out of there I think I was more rattled then I then I\nHow do you deal with that I think I cried for about two or three seconds and then put myself together\nThe offices last they didn't get to say much to Gabriel all ... and then they went home and just lay awake in bed\nOr something maybe two hours I married him your replaying things in your head and [noise] it's overwhelming it really started\nSmoking in on the way back to the station the gravity of the situation and you start realizing that did we just have to people's lives in a [noise] um so yeah so then you get like kind of a second rush of adrenaline\nI guess it's probably hard to to think of yourself in the way that people describe you which is of course and using the hero but I mean did you have a moment of patting yourself on the back that night\nI didn't I was telling Josh today even 'cause we work together and like I still have a hard time thinking abusing not work\nWell you might not be able to describe yourself that way but you hold on one second I just got I got to do something really quickly\nKleber told me that part of the condition of the green this interview was that he wanted to thank the offices for what they've done and that I could connect them so I called him\nTrying to say thank you\nIt's nice to finally talk to you that's for sure [noise]\nActually wanted to talk to them and I never wanted to come to me sounds for barbecue maybe just something to say thanks no pressure or an\nAbsolutely I always enjoy good barbecue can\nIt's a police officer talking to an engineer yet so typically not the most emotionally expressed in people on the planet but I could tell that did mean a lot to them to speak and what better way to show your feelings than three grilled meat anyway the experience has after all changed ...\nIt would be complete lie to say no one of the things that has definitely changed his appreciation of the time that a happier even though the small problems that we have in a day to day basis\nI was appreciative of even having to stand in line at the or the equivalent to the motor vehicle bureau to go get my license because it was destroyed\nSo everything was great because you made it\nThe paperwork seemed a lot less of a hospital [noise]\nOh and a on a side note cleaver did make it up to his door to they've actually seen several films together
