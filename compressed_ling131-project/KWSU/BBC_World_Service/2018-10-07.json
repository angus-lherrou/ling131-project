on\nTravel with Rick Steves we're learning how things work in Japan with Dr routine kind of [noise] she's rattled the differences between American and Japanese culture all her life and then the author of the guys [noise] called living abroad Japan Ruthie also caused by tours of ...\nWebsite living abroad in Japan dot com [noise] you grow up as a child of a missionary parents and I know I was always curious about this it seemed like when you have a spiritual vacuum people\nEmbrace [noise] pop religions come and go do you have any ever think about that while you're in Japan\nWell I think the Japanese attitude towards religion is very different than in our country that is they're not exclusive to one religion or another they take the best of any religion and adopted as part of their life it's almost just part of the culture so\nFor example babies that are born they take them to a shrine to be dedicated\nAnd most weddings are either ... or Christian because they're attracted to the idea of a western style wedding but most funerals are Buddhist because Buddhism has to do with the afterlife whereas she do has to do with\nSacredness and the president life ... and so they just depending on the time of year the season or the particular festival it might be Buddhist it might be she thought it might be Christian\nIn your book you wrote that and I was just adding up the numbers are you said eighty percent of the people identify as Shinto sixty seven percent identify as Buddhist and I thought it didn't resent plus sixty seven that's more than a hundred but it ... because people can can gather their religions I guess\nYes and so one of the difficulties I I guess you'd say for missionaries such as my parents were\nOther religions or so and as a missionary you'd have to do and that's from the northern God's before me or or this sort of a right to ...\nAnd that would be a tough because I remember I had friends in Japan who who were kind of like sure that sounds good I'll I'll embrace that but it wasn't that the exclusion of anything else\nSo that would that's right they would pick on Christianity but but it wouldn't be the only religion routine what is Shinto and and I mean I'm sure that's a complicated question but I have a good sense of what his Buddhism and what his Hindu his orders Islam and Christianity and Judaism but ... what is that\nYes literally she do means the way up the gods it's a type of the animas him or the belief in the ... sacredness of\nNature a beautiful mountain or a beautiful old tree or a rock in the ocean has a sense of being sacred and so they are God's that help you in your life farmers would dedicate offerings too that God that help God of agriculture for example\nSo there are no images inching do like statues are idols or anything\nAnd it's believed by tradition that even the emperor of God has mystical origins and descended from the sun goddess who created the Japanese island\nThe emperor God do you mean the the upper who's considered a God\nUsed to be yes but not anymore right now he is a symbol of the state and the people but again Japanese don't exclusively claim one religion over another so these are just stories and missed that are passed down and children just learn what you're supposed to do when you go to saint Jill shrine\nIs kind of like it gives your society some basic parameters some cultural ideals it's sort of like a a classroom for ethics\nYes you could say that and it's the idea of sacredness making things\nClean and purifying getting rid of evil spirits and so there are many holidays that celebrate something a sheep though and there's regional festivals harvest festivals or rice planting festivals that are related to ... though so it's kind of blended into the daily life\nI was struck by a I was just confused at holiday time 'cause I was in Japan over Christmas when you're in and Christmas was like just a big party everybody was the subway was filled with people with cakes and everybody getting drunk and then on New Year's\nWhat a hundred and eight times on New Year's\nEve you go to the temple to a wash away the hundred eight types of sense that you may have committed so they'd be a temple down very slowly hundred any time [noise] and then as soon as this night passed on New Year's [noise] money people flock to the ... they'll shrine to pray for\nHealth and success and happy and by ambulance [noise]\nEven something to put in your car for traffic safety and so on at the sheep they'll try and so they do both Buddhist to get rid of the old year she do for the new year [noise]\nThis is travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Ruth you can make your book is the moon guidebook comfortable living abroad in Japan and routine when we're thinking about living in Japan once the respect for women in public in the workplace and so on the domestic world these days or just in general\nYeah so I think things are changing quite a bit the marriage rate has gone down and so has the birth rate because a lot of women\nPreferred to develop their career or start their own business or go abroad to study or even go overseas to start a business [laughter] so it's not quite as traditional as you might imagine and I think people do respect women and um there are many opportunities\nIn terms of employment and a large company they often have two tracks that women can choose from one is to go to managerial route where you're committed to\nWorking long hours for the company going on business trips and working just like the men are expected to but the other track is for women who value their own free time and don't expect to have a life long career than they are more like secretaries or support staff\nAnd sometimes then they quit when they get married there used to be pressure to quit\nWhen you get married but it's not true anymore so there are many changing yes so the younger generation has has pretty much that we're going to demand a little more respect I don't know if I put it in terms of demand respect but they're going ahead and doing what they want to on on their own and not\nNot necessarily thinking that you have to go to university and then get a job in a big company why not start your own company or\nRight start some kind of new service or go overseas [noise]\nNumber is eight seven seven three three three seven four to five\nGreat to have you had to experience yourself on Japan yes\nI was there for about six years um I Lived in rural Japan and most of the time so it was much different than Louis is experience in Tokyo\nOr in what was your experience like why are you doing for your work\nI was working as a teacher for the University of Maryland um and I taught at a military base and it will Cooney Japan\nUh and I live it's probably about Fifteen clicks from the base and spent most of my time in the local economy and then I was teaching part time down in Tokyo ... I was teaching English to a group of farmers\nSo I Would get on the train two nights a week and take this little rickety train local train down to Tokyo rama and teach a group of about a pharmacist for several years and I developed a really intimate relationship as people down there\nAnd it really opened a lot of doors to have that close friendship with them and they were the ones that taught me all the Japanese basically I ever learned\nSo you were able to break into the society as a foreigner and make real friendships with the locals\nI did and it was amazing there was two things that I did one of them was learn Japanese which a roofing eluded to which opens a lot of doors people are really really friendly once you at least make an effort and the other one was I tackled the transportation problem\nI didn't really want to buy a car because it's very expensive to buy a car very hard so I bought an extremely small motorcycle little fifty cc motorcycle but the maximum speed limit in Japan is about thirty five miles an hour so every weekend I Would take off with another friend and we would go exploring\nSomeplace and knows it sometimes totally lost\nAnd Scott in your in your years of living in Japan what was your favorite eating experience what sort of street food did you like\nThere's food that's called ... or ... and probably Ruth he knows what that is called dancing shrimp and the theory behind actually mayor ... she is the pressure of the\nWhat\nTV viewers in the U.S have long enjoyed many British produced and dramas mysteries and comedies and more on

even a peek into the palace theories like Elizabeth and the crowd\nAnd even though most of the theories are fictional many use real like places is back dropped settings places that dance can actually

or whatever\nTend to not be was filmed in ... council which is frequently open to the public schools I since tend to not eat soft and booked up to three years we've been phones so there's loads of these places that\nCould be a disappointment and said you want to go to you'd think you can go to ... castle and it's actually not possible to do things difficult that's looking man yeah and then if you're a Doc Martin fan\nOh that's easy that she just tries to pull ties up\nAnd down in Cornwall and the ... yeah\nAnd you can clamor there with all the other crowd to see the schoolhouse and the doctors how does that way and the pharmacy or the ... be prepared to pay to park and walk quite a long ways to get into the town\nAnd it's not that I Would not crowded yeah it's a lot of people there and the people are just thrilled to go there you know I was there last year and they were filming so we were able to watch\nThis [laughter] so how do we organize that with with the film and going on

I was sold out about what\nI Know I Know but you know what they have nothing right now like it's very difficult for audit to go there on tour 'cause it's not worth it like in the economy excite economy side but also people are afraid to go out during the night you know\nTo concerts and so they tried to make ... early during the day that they don't have to be exposed to like you know at eleven PM\nLeaving the theater so yeah for me was also surprised I was sold out even though it was the night but yeah they're they're they're just like a craving for talent and for people to go on things for them\nAnd when you are an all just from a country to reduce highlighted at the moment full sadly all the wrong reasons do you feel that since ... of pressure to perform to to writes about it to sing about who took to put some sort of message out there about the situation back home\nOf what color pressure at all I think it's something that we actually it comes naturally that wouldn't want to talk about it that uh as I said because my family's there I'm not I'm really far from the token I say that yeah from the situation because I talk to them everyday and they're living at you know\nBut I think it's something that has happened naturally for us to talk about it or to express how we feel and it's more about missing\nMy family missing the beautiful beaches we stare missing the fact that like if I Want to bring people to go on and and see where I'm from they they don't want to go because we're what they see the news and uh\nIt's not too pretty [laughter] um so but yeah I I'm hopeful you know like I think things are going to get better because they have to you and people are very very brave and when I went last time people are still working you know he was young people\nBetter Venezuela and that was very touching for me and the good times what's McGough redrawn and like\nI had if you really have to say it's not because I'm from their release you all go to admit that yeah I Know I uh but it's beautiful I think it's perfect the whether we have actually it's maybe Ninety degree the whole year [noise] I Know it may sound bad for you is actually very uh it's amazing because we have to win\nA ... grade people are happy all the time Everytime I showed pictures to people there like\nWhat the hell are you doing here [laughter]\nType major margarita rod and another is playing in London for the first time of the E F G London jazz festival the twenty fifth of them but just some final brief words from you both somebody it's an interesting insight into into somebody\nPerforming abroad because she has to be a broad bonded lodging reflections on the family she's missing was going to go back home\nYeah well it's funny that the one thing they're called my attention when you're talking to her when you started to touch on the delicate political situation it was the coded language yeah I remember that from the years with the military dictatorship in Brazil\nWas a coded language there are things that you want her to pass it but you couldn't actually say yeah because you were a fresh you worried about what would happen to family exactly yeah she's got family there and so she was worried\nYeah yeah I I think it's interesting that she said people I thought for culture of course that might cut I got to be ... and mainly allies see I I actually have a friend living there\nAnd um I Can't understand that say concert was thrown out a ... at\nBoth of them and said well listen we're going to have a bit more of how music [noise] going to say thank you for joining this morning [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

machine audio perception because humans of course how some limits to their perceptual\nAbility for example after a very loud sound human won't be able to proceed with Gary fly it's on a tray speech recognition system that's just the same and there's other effects like that\nSo not only can you not your clients after an hour but also when you have a very loud talented one frequency for example let's say you at the very very outlawed\nFifty for hunting and you won't be able to hear very quiet sounds like at fifty five for its really close by to that child silent and also so called cycle who's the masking effect are utilized already by many gadgets and checks so for example you were an MP three player\nAlso uses those cycle it could take it to be able to work with very compressed

that\nWon't be perceived or maybe not in coal them so precisely so there's a lot of checked out there that's using the old um cycle to stick masking effect but we were wondering if it would also be plus to use\nOr an automatic system\nRight so it seems from your research that there are ways of am betting and doing so imperceptibly OJ move by militias ... within very sounds\nAnd they might be able to trick or something like what about your voice and sort of that so you have another example which involves an autonomous cars do you like drawing let's vehicles what is\nThe idea is really that

likewise cold temperatures the reduction in cold temperatures strings cold temperatures spells ... those are being reduced as well\nOr where it becomes harder is in terms of assessing precipitation assessing drought assessing even smaller scale features like tornadoes\nThat right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\nWhen it then that will that please be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which route so much damage and the heroin is just a few weeks back\nWell I\nLive [noise]\n\nKnow that\nLast week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains the central ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but\nIssue in the ... because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and sub tropical western Atlantic where these storms tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warmth is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you\nReally warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before farms made landfall ... raised with ... wins the Atlantic song Clinton expect Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasting relations that we did which are very similar to a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change takes on a model that the area where um there was the most with imitation overland after impact of the storm split\nFifty percent increase due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which is as a great sum likelihood of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strengths of the event is being changed\nYeah so what we're doing a slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that in bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause has Michael Mann has already explained it was the ... Atlantic temperatures the field to hurricane I was curious how in ...\nWell to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of past research by climate scientists and that pattern is in uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they're warmer area and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without\nGreenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initial education so that when we run these modified forecast without climate change for a large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that had on the atmosphere temperature as well as at a certain temperature changes that have a choice during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific pack them ... associated with the greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform\nA changing of the tea we actually have a pattern change of the after the ... that comes from the fact that the climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included in the data\nAnd these conscience of geographical variation can lead us look\nUnder the bonus of climate change so to speak because the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes Mississippi interest Michael Mann particularly in the like the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still far out in the Atlantic\nLarge part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius\nSo there is a very large region in the Atlantic to sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually expanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms\nFarther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see him that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as\nWell is marginal changes to the Atlantic book potentially ... van rapid

doing their their field observations\nAnd also we were you know trying to deploy are bullies and you know we couldn't find many flows that were very thick so we're putting out these beliefs and ice that may be a meter sick and you're hoping that it will still survive\nAnd locations where we put some of our buoys out already went through about twenty centimeters of melt since we had deployed them

who might have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans were on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish\nAnd this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the\nPresident yet the midterm elections are less than a month's away and President Trump has this a

polling are just sort of the national\nSentiment all the signs have been pointing in the direction of a very strong year for the Democrats you do have Republicans seeing this as a potential\nA last minute surge for them but it is still a month away and that is frankly still a lot of time for things to move around\nI ... and the trajectory is still rather remarkably as you said at those statistics are very good for the party in power usually a president with this kind of economic strength is pulling quite high and yet the president is quite unpopular and that has rubbed off on the

think he will be received by his new colleagues well I think they'll all suck\nIt up hill suck it up bill suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask you have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but just as soon as Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's been incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial being neutral and of not being simply an extension of a terribly polarized political process and environment\nThan we left that um this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all tend to it all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep her relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term\nSometimes they can't afford a avoid getting sucked into very big controversies there is for example
