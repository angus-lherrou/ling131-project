series of tests and of course we're we're tested on you know every six months for in a simulator do these amazing slow motion simulators which are you know not much less expensive on an airplane of um cases and so there's definitely a a huge on training obviously there's qualifications which are required and\nAnd I don't think there are many professions or how much a recurring I'd combinations and

a\nFrenzy about Downton Abbey which takes us intimately into this fascinating world of English aristocracy a century ago your theories takes us to Australia in the in the age we think of as Eisenhower and leave it to beaver and just sort of the we have enough to objects in ...\nThese little post war for us that's how we define it and there was a depression um people were returning or not set up a lot of loss a lot of shrapnel emotional shrapnel in people's psyche is\nA lot of the men disappeared into the women had sort of taking orders I found a better place for themselves in society and

I had that sense when I saw you even when you were stealing\nFrom a Britain back to Australia after the war and the place to go home the sense was you were going to march right in there and this is a new age and women are going to be respected\nWell after I had a way\nLong time and as I say my to the men left so the women had to fill those roles they were pushed out of the kitchen and into the

world um it's like traveling when I traveled to Japan I this is like being on another planet I Love it so much but it's so different and so completely about and that's what they show really is\nAnd it's just beautifully written and delicious around and and wonderful acting I Do think that a lot of us it's a hit in Australia and part because Australians are just a story about the fifties or does it um challenge them to see where they are today and where they need to go\nI think by those things and I think actually what so unique about this show is that three generations sit down to watch it together and that old fashioned thing of sitting around the fire then sitting around the radio than sitting around the television\nHas been returned to families a lot of people talk about that how they all sit down together because\nPlaying out their lives that there's something to recognized for everyone\nWhat a delight for the older generation to sit down with their grandchildren and because this can verbalize or or or help them visualize this reality and it also artfully deals with a lot of the dark side of a\nSort of sweeps superficial world that really need to be dealt with thoughtfully absolutely\nThis is travel with Rick Steves we're talking with mark Russell door she's pretty sure Adam's in a place to go home began in Australia and it's come to the United states on

green policy of you know you're just there should be on foreign minister from ten years ago the rubber still too centrist screens which is the role of the most radical fundamentalism type of green movement [noise]\nI I don't know that there certainly I I Would have actually it's often just with a different place the Green Party they have two very charismatic leaders\nAre they've gone and they worked very hard\nOn them they're they're at their pro you know\nThere are anti racist I mean and they're part of an orange movement in Germany I mean there was a huge demonstration in Berlin yesterday to uh you know for tolerance they expect forty thousand people turn up and two hundred and forty thousand people turned up\nFor their their pro tolerance or pro environment you know primary sources at you know clean energy and and and they are they want a fair deal for a you know migrants and refugees to come to this country\nSo I think a lot of people are more interested in that kind of humane politics I've also heard people say you know I don't mean to say the U.S use time for the Christian social union and the people are saying the courage to end the social union they missed the humane policy and politics but used to be in those parties\nIt's interesting you can get through the migration is now a big policy for the Green Party\n[noise] and it's because of that migration has ah two thousand Fifteen in particular it has really divided that the ah the country if I did the way people think there are a lot of people that you don't want\nPeople coming in to people who are doing very well particularly pensioners which is also another issue in the election they don't I mean they're feeling the pinch\nAnd they don't know why people are coming in and taking their money so to speak [noise] they're also worried about loss of\nAnd there there's a sense of ... see no their culture and they're afraid at part of the things that the state said there again and immigration particularly from Islamic countries on that this is a scene with a lot of people who are worried about the uh\nThe flavor on the car on defense of their own culture Christian\nLooking back to that report from James ... from Texas I noticed you raise your eyebrows sticking with this topic of immigration but the last speaker and that was Georgia tuna founder of the Hispanic Republicans of Texas coast you grew up in the United states as a migrant what's your take on\nThat I thought it was particularly ridiculous I mean quite often migrants or people who have migrant I'm a lineage and I tend to be some of the most conservative and um people across the globe so when he was talking about the fact that we needed border controls in detention to ensure that those people from across\nIn Mexico don't come over just made me think\nYou know the complicity of all of us in these discussions um and the fact of the matter is you know border control high borders detentions actually create more clan to sign forms of migration where people feel like they have to go to smugglers\nSo your sense of what you're doing is you're giving smugglers and people who engage in ... forms of migration um and and income\nUm and and you're creating an opportunity for migrants to to to be out in more danger um so I just I just found that it was quite interesting that this you know I'm Latino Republican so harsh\nAbout migrants coming from from Mexico when in actuality that's the same rhetoric the same race is sort of xenophobia grabbing rhetoric that Donald Trump has enabled across across the United states I don't I don't know why this happened\nBecause you're you're right I've heard this perspective before why would someone with you to an understanding of the issues that immigrants face what why would they moved to ... I think what's\nInteresting is that the divide and conquer the divide and rule sort of a you know notions across the globe have have done a ... I had made a fundamental impact on how people see this as an us and them kind of perspective so migrants who assimilate into places like the United states\nUm tend to be very wary of those who were coming across the border I'm going to be offensive you know there's a finite set of resources that we need to really protect\n'em and people who look like me I'm may some sometimes subtle that particular perspective or my place in the United states so there's a sort of threat that people feel not only domestic citizens but those who again have migrated Egypt which for me it's very warm like a logical but that's that's the way of the world\nHas thrown a measure your professor of history and politics of modern China just how big it\nChina coming in the intent on migration something like a hundred and fifty to two hundred million people I mean you know the\nSigns are more than most European countries essentially moved from ... villages throughout China to build buildings work on high speed railways and it's actually provide the labor back then China but those people who are not properly documented they come clean for ... education right\nFor children and that's one of the single biggest problems facing chimes today the question of poor people wanting to move to where the money is\nThe city's weekend from the BBC well service with me I like Fritz Germany's foot bowling side has continued they've lost three nailed to the Netherlands that six feet in ten games Alistair Ross joins me from ... got us\nTo how much pressure is that for a change of manager I ask a question of face to face the ... since Nineteen Ninety three the first time ever the Gemini have gone three games without scoring that bought some of the three tame European nations league with to match it to go and facing a trip to world champions from snakes so\nGiven this all comes off they finished bought some of that group of the world cup and of course the angry and very public international retirement of ... despite the fact that he's won the world cup on a confederation cop in his twelve years in charge by not jak you love knows the pressure to perform is growing\nVoluntarily just stay with us today on the any kind of hard and disappointing match to lose three nail in the first few minutes we have control and created a few chunks days I'll biggest problem is that we're not taking them the situations that was sweating training didn't work in the matches disappointing the way we played in the last ten minutes when we can see two goals\nAt this level than it shouldn't happen so I was an amount of hours in the first thing\nI was the big match in Europe on Saturday and the Africa Cup of nations qualifiers and Bob ways to one way in in the Congo amount of gas because one they'll when a white ...

China [laughter]\nThat's right and in many ways that he was arrested last week in Beijing and is now being put up on bribery charges in China but it's part of a much bigger story which is a crackdown by Xi Jinping the Chinese leader and his Communist Party government on not just corruption actually political opposition as well so the two things come together\nAnd that enabled by one very interesting\nFor surveillance than China much more than any other government in the world you might say it's almost a kind of trial run for us all to surveillance state in which everyone's behavior is going to be monitored they'll have little ID cards\nAnd owners not just the financial details or your rent a criminal record but also things that you do in the neighborhood may be recorded so there's

in in the hands of the Chinese state was going to be used to target the credit rating to lower the credit rating of anyone found smoking in public\nThat's right it's what's called social credit in other words if you do things ... criminal but or in some ways against public morals to be crossing the road at the wrong place almost seems to be of course criticizing the government that will be on the record and you might find that for instance you turn up the railway station you want to buy a ticket\nAnd you'll id concerts sorry you don't have enough social credit points to actually do that it's a completely new way of controlling the population and it's going to get bigger and bigger [noise] wrote\nTo you mentioned earlier in the program about your research on race based immigration in some West African countries how much debate you see about this and the country's concern for\nLet's raise bait citizenship causing so the countries Liberia and Sierra Leone which I'm or formerly\nUm cleave he sort of a slave history with those two countries where former on a menu methods late from the United states and Britain Kamen founded these countries as a form of\nEnabling black people to own the means of production and running their own state of affairs um and so the two countries have re citizenship clause that basically stay only people of negro descent so effectively black people can be citizens of Liberia and the early on\n'em and what's fascinating for me about this historically that you know the Westphalia and his thumb that uh or or sort of huge white missed as a reference for citizenship white and male inside the reference for citizenship\nBut with these countries are effectively doing and you can debate whether or not it's right or wrong is that they're centering blackness as a reference for citizenship and for me the incredibly revolutionary because they basically\nState you know the black lives matter movement black lives matter movement and bringing to the fore that black lives matter I'm black citizenship better than it should be the central focus point for having a discussion about us citizenship there is a debate particularly in Liberia\nGranted that he thought people were crying and shouting I go down and looked at him lying there leading to facts confused and no one knew what to do\nHis killers have never been brought to justice protected by an

Nineteen Seventy seven until Nineteen eighty and these were the years just before the twelve year civil war broke out here and he was he was really be loved and\nRespected because he spoke out very strongly about the injustices that existed here and at that time the country was under a military dictatorship so that was pretty risky thing to do and in fact it ended up costing his life he was shot to death the day after he gave a Sunday sermon directing\nThemselves specifically to the members of the armed forces and saying to them you do not have to obey and immoral order to go out and and kill people and that\nDid not go down well with some of the authorities said who kills them\nWell it was for the most part people from you on the government's by the military or were recalled these death squads although it's really important to point out that there was a growing left his movement here it eventually\nGrew into a a guerilla movement that launched the war and when they did when they committed human rights abuses\nArchbishop Romero was very quick to condemn them too so he was even handed if you will you make a mistake and that you do something wrong and you can count on him denouncing you for it in his homily the following Sunday no matter what your political position was\nHis killer of never being brought to justice why not\nFor a long time after the war ended in Nineteen Ninety two there was an amnesty law and\nWith that the case couldn't go anywhere now the country's Supreme Court has overturned that in the law and actually this week in Rome the leader of\nThe Catholic Church cardinal roast the child has has said he thinks it's really important that there would be a trial because he says the wounds from the war has never healed and the only way for them reading to heal\nIs for the country to find out what the truth really was\nA bad his assassination and then for justice\nI have a three thousand people have signed a petition opposing a plan

racist\nJimmy Kenya teaches media and communications at the University of ... and told me why he backed this cool\nAnd they had the most in Malawi has no connection to countries that used to live down in Africa and and the thing in the least Cynthia that have been a few publications that are questioning his stance on Africa Afrikaans agreeing that he was one way or the other interesting he heard a lot of\nPeople will be quite surprised to hear this but except perspective that say much in recent years what do you see evidence somehow McGahn deep being racist [noise] when\nYou look at the relations in Malawi has quite a large Indian community and the most of them run businesses and business owners and there's always been sort of conflict between\nIndia and business owners and allow in way cause the Indian community in Malawi doesn't lead it means that they don't really socialize with Phyllis though the ... malaria and community so from my perspective there's a context to that argument\nAnd yet there is a significant Indian community in Malawi ... unless you've said you have the Indian government building this conference center [noise]\nHe is the point from in the gum and perspective is more or less like how they argued in gun away the gun in government was forced to take your study it my to my gun from the rest of the argument the van was that it has been sort of cardio relationship and it's been good a diplomatic relations between the country and India is\nJust an argument that that's being made in Malawi\nAnd here we're talking about is that you something that is going to stand in the middle of Malawi his commission will copy it will be a sign of tolerance if you want to have to start to build a sign up not always moved on ... years\nYou could argue from that perspective but then when they begin to think about what a structured stunts voice completely different thing by ... you're attending the future generations under current generations that here's somebody that I Do my pile it'd be\nSo it's not in the hot and I got ... who would you like to have a statue off\nThis list of Milo young so difficult for me just to name one pill so but I

country like a few do something but it wouldn't be ugly or something [noise]\nShe retired from the university law we are statutes are a bunch of things on a I'm broke too absolutely I think what's interesting about this case is it really it comes out of the outgrowth of a de colonization pan African his movement across the continent where people are looking at colonial structure\nBe they buildings or names of street um widely line just recently changes need to eat fourteen me to go back to the indigenous name 'em and even the ... movement at the University of Cape Town with black students talked about it they make violent\nUm where you know racist policies across the university needed to move this uh the statue of the road to the minister colonialist um across the southern African region so I think it it it's a bigger kind of conversation that's happening across the continent in academics pasted but also at national level Rona you listening to that to what did you make of it\nWell first of all the time that the speaker is what's going to campaign had the name of the city of down time change but I think that's an alternate ditched his name but I'd say there's two reasons why respectfully I Would completely disagreed with his position\nThe first one is that he said the company has nothing to do with Africa in fact across buffalo having spent large parts of his life in South Africa across the whole of Africa and Kenya in South Africa and elsewhere Indian communities would\nDeeply involved with liberation movements the African National Congress because very closely involved with the Indian National Congress which for independence to India\nAnd remembering the liberation was cosmopolitan citizen existed across confidence not just within Africa within India is very important and the second even more important reason is to do with non violent resistance that was gone these great contribution to independence movements the idea of math\nNon violence in our current terribly violent era I think that's the contribution that's well worth making of course on down the ups and reprehensible views when he was younger he moved completely against those when he was older\nAnd rejected cost racism and so forth to understanding how Feige has developed means that they're not saying that human beings who deserve respect and gum has as much to say to Africa as great African leaders like Monday last half to the entire world\nInteresting isn't it though how one person can be viewed differently in two different prices ten seconds each [noise] yeah I mean I think you know I I hear the the points that are taken I think the the ...\nAnti racist movement um but yeah you're you're absolutely right that that the power perspective isn't it run a ten

Navarro the terms are less than a month for white voters will decide on the makeup of the house and many will also cheered governors over the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level and now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the cuts\nThe reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break 'em down\nJessica highly to so can Democrats cut into the geo peas edge among governors they haven't really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats\nAnd it's incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of got in a really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it it's a good sign for Democrats math is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month that the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida is always\nYou know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple state\nAnd so that's going to be a really you have a Trump ally there and Rhonda stances it's going to be I think are really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams will be the first African American woman ever elected
