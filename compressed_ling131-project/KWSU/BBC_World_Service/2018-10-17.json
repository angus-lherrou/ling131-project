political momentum it'd be very either on them and that you are very adamant\nAt the very end so weekends with the greens that actually what surprised if you like the gas or an\nOur music is coming up Wednesday you should watch out for them but the mood across Europe definitely politics as polarizing I chaired the European Parliament and increasingly when I called vote you see that the extremes on the right and left him vote the same way on issues so it's not just\nAbout ideology here there's something else happening in ... in the body politic I mean I Would worry about whether the central\nCould be quite election but don't you to the that the mainstream blown out of the pie in the European socialist and many people are told him to be opinion but to be with according to many people around your they look like the tie tired old Brussels elites who have milk delivered I Know the\nThe union and the language which killed a referendum here I'm quite frankly becoming a bit tedious I may I may have aged since I got elected but I'm not tired\nTo look for him to leave out actually want to happen in Hungary and told them this is reality I don't I Know\nAll of that is reality but my job is not to give in to a reality that I Believe would be bad for my children and I have four of them and in fact I warn them I say to them\nYou have taken for granted pay sounded confident because it's there nothing is a given I my biggest worry and I do try to do with it sometimes in fact we were under what the European Union good\nWhich was developed peace and prosperity on the continent of Europe for the idea that you can have\nYour own individual policy or you can be a populist when you have to do is say something but not take the responsibility for us I take responsibility for what I Do and what I say and I hope that in the European Parliament elections we talk about your unlock nationally should because they tend to be a button\nOn his I appreciate your historical perspective but he is a quote from a man widely respected around your Pasco lamb and form a commission that he's been without change and reform\nIn the end you will remain as it is today in his view irrelevant to a majority of it out as much stronger now only worry and coming from Europe file\nYeah it is worrying I mean you could wear yourself to death he was to do something with it I mean the first part where you're saying reform and he's of course that's essential I mean the thing about being a rather than just hold on a second in art and for example many of us took for granted\nThe single market customs and without understanding what's meant it's breakfast right across Europe because of the debate people are beginning to understand the single market the customs union how drugs or regulation chemicals are banned if they're if they're dangerous I mean Europe has done that have pets can be brought on holidays this loan it to the largest part of how we live today\nHas happened because of the good stuff that Europe does but frankly and I was a journalist no media is interested in the good things and you're right to focus on all of that or is it difficult needs to be challenged because that's my job to do that but it not time it's no harm to remind people that were dumped the European Union for my country be we would not be at the table\nWe after when

we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an on board generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the battery as of now but rather designed for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now and then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be and what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely unreliable you\nRight now or as soon as possible and then upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game\nIt's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies and you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in about ... that can absolutely are thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where\nYou know the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft some of these start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they developed the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western thirties how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly\nSo much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus splits in Europe to worry about maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board\nThere is a road map for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to seize the high loaded versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric powered trains like the one with vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types then grows\nWe took about taxes I think of a tax is going to be picking me up from I'm In my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably in the first thing we're going to see this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think it's a nice traffic charities and the wells a lot of them are in the developing world on there you know might have been older they have passed laws regulations that they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nAbsolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok\nSao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the Sao paulo market very carefully and right now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on tops of the buildings around the city and so\nIs this type of transportation model isn't something the theoretical it actually already exist in one city busy business people five to ten times a year and\nWe all find ourselves in these cities where\nOkay my flight was late getting it I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on light expense report I Need to get there now on those few times a year when you really need to get somewhere it's really valuable to you to get up and over the traffic passing\nAre we going to see this resolution you're describing so I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and all ... out by saying that I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus and less like a taxi you're going to see a fused\nThree of the major business centers around the city so that you you started to deliver this rap and transportation option and then it just starts to grow from there\n... botch of vertigo arrow hair on business day from the BBC\nThat really for the new

some Seventy or eighty stocks opposite battling to develop the hard way I'm ride sharing tech but I'm\nAlso is investing millions of dollars in infrastructure and lobbying Steve tape it says there's a public relations effort underway to persuade ordinary citizens that this could be that future transport model as well\nI mean they're doing a great job in galvanizing industry employing everybody together to go after the common goal to get air taxi ride sharing on parity with owning a car which is while it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but really it but realistic\nUh you know people would argue with that the realism but even if they're close you know there are still going to be people that have a meeting across town and there's gonna be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things and simply finding places in big cities to land I guess but it's going to start in Europe and America what was going to start somewhere else about half the regulatory hurdles so that's why\nI think probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong credits or water water bound in super crowded and there's a lot of money there and it just a natural fit\nYeah a lot of islands to jump on perhaps less dangerous for that reason because when you're not going to crash onto onto a house if you did come down\nRight over the water most of the time but you know if you look around the world a lot of a lot of the most popular city to live in our water bound so there's an application for this type of transportation\nTheloop hyping top pilots

because one major accident and they could shut this down in an afternoon it's a real worry and that's providing pulls fulfill for us in the industry back\nIn the seventies I think they used to be a helicopter taxi service operating around New York and then it flipped over and killed ... people and they're not really done it since I have a oh what's the Pan Am building most ... whether it was a helicopter crashed that\nThat was cool by ... and so again we have problems in developing these these technologies but oddly enough this is one area in which the technology actually solve the problem we've had in the past I think the the ... to\n... that will pay an easing in period we the public needs to get used to the idea suggested in the same way that we had the the the person walking in
