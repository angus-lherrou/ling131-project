in the fight against global warming was looking for any source of electrical power doesn't see a too into the atmosphere I don't think grilling false making a quarter of well generational ready and moving to a third by twenty twenty three according to the latest international Energy Agency research\nHarvard University's David Keith backs solar power\nAnd in a pair of widely debated papers last week found full with wind power\nSuggesting that by changing atmospheric behavior wind farms can add to global warming he took me through his logic\nFundamentally should do with the simplest thing in science which is conservation of energy and\nSome of the simplest way to think about wind turbines think about every winter buys being independent from every other self you know how hard the wind is blowing you can just think of how much power I went to the next ten figure that wind turbines are all independent of course they're not all independent and the and\nThe atmosphere is one big heat edging it's driven by power from the sun and that power as always connected so if you take a lot of energy out of one place\nThere's less energy somewhere else that's really the core things conservation energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take energy from the atmosphere venue gonna be cool to get down but that's not quite the argument to my\nThat's a very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so of the energy that come in from the sun only about a third of ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest is heat and the energy\nBut it's indirect consequences huge ... of course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere\nSo if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct just a patient that energy and the winds that matters that's hardly important what matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heated momentum at that in turn can\nRedistribute heated momentum and have some kind of climate consequences\nSo effectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the wind from my bills said\nYes and they're now lots of observations of warming a wind farm so at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because there's more solar energy coming through this because you don't get a cooling effect to the ground from the wind taking heat from the soil well most of the it's\nA it's probably neither of those things it's several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night when turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere\nAnd especially at night when the atmosphere is quite stratified when you have warmer airline above cooler when you mix that up you tend to work on the surface there other impacts but that's the simplest\nSo you end up at night having an effect is that right then the biggest effect is at night yes how much of an effect on me I can understand that too you know that could be a bit of a tweaking but that wouldn't be with publishing well I mean\nThe effects in the region where large wind farms are\nSeem to be warming sort of nighttime warning of order a degrees centigrade or a little bit more something like that but the issue really is\nHow to think about the benefits compared to the harm so when turbines are immensely better than coal and we have to ... energy system this is all about choices we make as we do carbon eyes\nI suppose what I'm saying is one wouldn't phone on a global scale either I'm supposed to have the biggest saint ... you'll modeling is for lots of numbers of wind farms\nYeah about one wind farm doesn't have a big benefit either the right way to think about it is to think about the tradeoffs between benefits and costs that's on the strip for wind power is true for any kind of interesting\nSo one wind turbine does a very inside a decimal amount to reduce global climate change by making clean energy and so a single wind turbine very slightly reduces climate change\nDirect climate change is this just want a dent in the benefits of wind farms or want to get out to all together\nI don't think he wipes it out altogether I mean if you're talking wind versus say current called generation which also has huge air pollution impacts\nAnd given the very long time scale of us have to in the atmosphere I don't think this is a reason to abandon twin tower but I think it's important that the community begin to take this research seriously and consider this as part of decisions about how we see carbon eyes\nSo there's been debate over\nDecades about what the energy or power density is a winter around race basically how much power you can get from a single square kilometer of land with winter buys and\nPeople have suggested it's a very large numbers tens or hundreds of megawatts per square kilometer\nWe've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you the location of every single us wind turbine we've been able to get an average value for the entire us fleet\nAnd we get a number it's more like half a watt per square meter and that's you know a factor of\nBetween a few and even ten times less than some important estimates by the U.S department of energy or the BCC and that means that you're generating given amount of power it takes more land than people thought with wind and that has more environmental consequences\nWill not simple because I Know that you over interest in solar power and I believe that the ... ... square meat or you can get from some of the power a bigger than that\nYeah solar power is roughly ten times more what's per square meter and that sounds like a very abstract thing that you you know only often would care about but the point here is about how much land humans have to dedicate to the energy system which will you have environmental and social impact\nNothing we do at the scale of modern energy is going to be in a free burning coal is probably the worst thing we can do we have to stop doing that but as we transition we have to think about the relative impacts say of wind or solar of nuclear power or what have you and they're the big important are finding I think that\nThe land footprint of solar is something like ten times smaller than the land footprint of wind for the same generation and in addition when has this climate impact and he's climate impacts are I think not enough to say you should forget about wind power that but there are enough that we have to start paying attention to them\nHarvard David Keith roughly feathers with these new rules on wind power you can get a sense of how ruffled if you look at this time on on active duty climate\nThat like most Scientists David

the tiny insects maintain that balance like apple on my colleague immediate ... ... more from the leader such a ... yeah\nMy calling us that he led to understand how flies are able to maintain our swat find one thing we already knew about five that they had these specialized tied links called how here's an\nHere's are basically to fry equivalent of your inner ear stimulus or you're going for balance and size can't fly if they don't have their health care so one thing you can do is actually removed the healthcare should not fly and they can still take off but once they're airborne they just were complete control come through the air\nSo that's not new information the first time I did that experiment was Seventeen fourteen I think about what we didn't know what how hard chairs actually works but what information where the hell chairs provide for the fly someone or if you're that out what I did with the record from the healthcare they're on and I found that the timing of it\nI recorded while the health care was in a position that simulated a fly rotating so basically my data showed that five can tell the difference between stable flight and rotation simply by paying attention to the timing of this like coming from they're cheering her on\nTalk to about what they're targeting as well maybe 'cause they had that ability to kind of over at the same time but they're also quite quick that of getting away\nYeah so the ... century or they're more reflective there on the canals sensation that sort of how you feel like the vision and the reason they use these are there more reflective behaviors is because it's much faster than Bijan so it's kind of like they can immediately detect rotation and correct it really quickly\nWhat's important about this finding\nImportant for us because this research has shown away that complex aspect of an animal environment can be broken down\nTo the timing of a single spike so this is how our brains initially represent information in the world trade single bikes anything on there on every side and experience you've ever had that can be broken down into the activity of these individual neurons think Pfizer no different just seem to be here to study fried because they have a lot fewer neuron than a human what\nWhat will it mean for for humans information\nFiner than human neurons work exactly the same way so it certainly helps us to understand how different organisms sensory systems work in order to understand our\nOwn but there's also more immediate applications for this type of research that one example would be flight technology why is it had millions of years to evolve fast and efficient mechanisms for why so if we can figure out how they do it we can use some of the same technique to build

he's one of the office of this week's IPC the reporters and he's with me here in the studio\nYou read the report calls for the well to aim to keep rising label temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to comment a price\nIs the world on track to meet anything like that target festival\nOn to clarify up the report doesn't call for anything the report also is a question that the government have to ask do you see\nIn two thousand sixteen independent agreement on it was clear that two degrees of global warming was not the state level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit the woman to one point five and now just report\nClearly shows that the reason they important difference between warming one point five and two degree and also shows demeans into raising rich global warming can be limited to that level\nAnd so just to be clear the well I'm trying to do anything like that\nThere to report is also very clear to broke his knock on track Kerman pleaded pledges of the countries that they submitted under the Paris Agreement lead lead to increasing emissions overtime and two twenty thirty whereabouts are missing should be decreasing very very deeply by twenty thirty\nPainted the picture Warsaw the consequences if temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five in two degrees for a few\nWe don't see any scientific evidence that they will ever survive at one point five degrees of warming it is still possible that some of them survive also for for ... ecosystem series and read the tea or shift and the impact\nOn forests and other systems and finding also for humans the difference between one point five in to a degree of warming is about more than four hundred million people that are more affected by heat waves\nAlready dark consequences coming out that a road map how ... do you try and make the changes that are needed to bring temperature down what sort of thing that the report suggests might be not very\nYou show that to people especially at the so far we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable live how do you prove to them that there are real consequences for their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible sign of ... on American my nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important to people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction and living ... I'm a licensed deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly\nBecause you don't have all the hanging around at the airport\nWhich are often outside the city center so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flights\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better quality to large they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design of ... birds lowering their missions and one in which people's living standards Ohio\nLewis is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in the bud and will be some ... and\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing\nFrom from switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy is something that maybe in two thousand and five to seven and ten that some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term cause that's an equate long term creeping coffee I'll give you some examples we know that the increase of seeing an extra ticket prices and that you cannot another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people for a larger share of their income is going into entity so we cannot say that there are no Lewis says what we can face\nTo compensate for the short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of government to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also now that the fossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are\nGoing to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training and we are emerging from these other high technology sectors down where thing you may be the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit\nSeen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get the short term\n... case as I can just bring you back for another year he was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between a one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nThings he isn't elements of politics and that to help people like you sell it because in that sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um\nWhen I looked to sort of question some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier round you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the television was a massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement although I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the parents agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I went from the sustainable finance area we can say the\n... financial products ... pension products have to be aligned with one point five Paris target for example I can argue that not in the parliament's no gain support for that was previously I didn't and I think the reason politicians are on board for this and say look ahead and I imagine a world that is climate change the climate is breaking down\nAnd they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is that real political will to make these changes not\nYou know I just want to us to do that when asking the question who is going to\nPay to for this one we should not see this as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual project wants\nTo just reading an investment in a safer and sustainable growth and went off from the question we're going to pay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today\nAnd with two degree you're forming deepest ... in the far future business um one point five to ... levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so did you just really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who's going to pay for ducked\nDown to route and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and and the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to be carefully managing managed to adopt the issue the port of the impacts of food that they can be compatible with sustainable development and entering the real world fair Laurie\nWants to come back and yeah and I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot has been done we have Ninety nine countries we\nWeren't able to see the entire Seventy three countries we have auctions fifty eight countries that are that have other places to subsidize renewables and thanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mitigation coming down significantly\nSo he's making it easier there isn't to global carbon price for instance the grade no but ... is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's\nPolitically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next election but I think what do we have to realize there's been um scholars and political science working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which have traditionally been\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that an increasing number of applications on countries indication they're beginning to be competitive so it's these invest managing it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing it is not enough\nOr as bad BCC reports he's reminding us okay um but I Do think this point at it's made all center report about making sure that the most vulnerable or not heard is not just necessary for ethical reasons but it's also necessary for political reasons because only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nYou know so when we talk about cautious important we remember the global economy is not stuffing and there were three big\nTrends aren't going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty surgeon down to zero by twenty fifty term for that period in the next between two thousand assisting and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to double Ninety ... will be invested in New infrastructure\nGlobal economy itself is what needs to double in size in Twenty years we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the population living in cities around the world is like it's a double in the next for two years they aren't trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our\nCurrent growth model which was delivering\nUS cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to pay not productive all we design our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing a to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that thought I Want to wrap up this how fast the now thank you ... panel throw a Diaz ... got ... case had\nA ... year we were a gal will tell you a short break just to remind you let us know what you think of the program or any ideas to topics you'd like to look into you can ... the real story a BBC ... or ... or tweet

another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration to actually accept the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute it's funded by the energy industry and he was on the Trump transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he may have Monday's IPC report\nFive investigated the claims and I find them watching from multiple viewpoint is one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deal with various effects on the planet and our own humanity man the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that there are quite\nAll but I mean again they say they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything besides it's good to say that would be swayed the administration that it needs to take this seriously [noise]\nAh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are a pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's Evan Davis said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea time back with us effective leadership is the last\nI think there is a fact of leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be an African the president\nI'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believed defiance\nAnd they've used a science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that efficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for weaker a vehicle emissions just last week\nSo we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on the science what they do have a view as they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nFull board wants to come in and bring you in\nThe United states government was one of the government so the proof the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not decided that it is something that the American government has signed up to\nHow but how do you decide gate and of course that trait howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all fact we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo innocent what happens in the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the state\nI unimportant lady when President Trump gives me the reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states the colon stunning United States has a long term decline because it simply cheap to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nIsn't the point the fact of becoming separated from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base\nProblems that they have in the United states something many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including coal mining industry um we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but they are the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is pick up because of the sea level rise is a good chance for the rural more than our fridge waters in the Gulf well partly because of climate change I think people will say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few area of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the U.S has gone way this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years he narrowed try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent on programs right to Ciro at uh the route investment\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nYou know carbon energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked to last about the first world the very developed well let's turn if we may\nTo pump the world that a growing I won't speak to treat the ... he's a professor of environment and developing in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joined us today from Cairo's joy to I Want to talk about India because you're in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing\nSoft but also the country that has taken its climate change commitments fairly serious he just described to some of the changes that are underway\nWell India it's trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but then if it up\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have gone right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda\nBut I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses were in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in job but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to stay over here is that happens studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have a huge savings in help\nAnd so that itself could be a reason for taking action on a fossil fuel and doesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost Indian governments have argued that a country that's growing is simply not polices it wasn't part of the industrialization prices that if you like caused the problems of climate change\nAnd therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay for it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the feet in Nineteen Ninety two house and then five at that time that developing countries are doing the knock must take action first [noise] no it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited basis the action so it's it's no longer viable argument to say

blamed for at least fourteen deaths NPR's Joel Rose in Miramar Beach Florida Joel thanks for being with us today Scott what is the situation seem like today\nWell as you mentioned there are lots of folks without power in the situation seems particularly dire in Panama City and some of the smaller towns in Bay county along the Gulf of Mexico\nThere in Panama City there's no water no power and no gas most gas stations are still closed 'em and and as you head out of town to find the stations do have gas or very long lines\nMany folks have evacuated from this region\nAnd you were in Panama City yesterday I gather which which would like they're\n[noise] it's a small city about thirty seven thousand residence 'em before the storm on it's on the bay it's not directly on the Gulf of Mexico that's not a luxurious town I mean the houses are set pretty close together and right now it's like every block\nIs is that almost like a scene from a disaster movie like either trees down there are wires in the street\nSeems like every building sustained some kind of damage or you know to the roof or to the wall I mean I saw a church\nThat was missing two of its walls and and you could just see from the pews right out into the the blue sky outside um churches schools public buildings hospitals all of this has to stay in a lot of damage a and I think it's starting to really dawned on folks to this is going to be a very long recovery\nRight now fourteen the gesture fourteen people have been reported and confirmed but I gather nobody there are things such that the final word\nUnfortunately no I mean I think people do think that the death toll is likely to rise up so far officials here have been pretty tight lipped they don't want to release numbers until they've finished the search and rescue process a bay county emergency chief mark ... was asked yesterday about the number of fatalities here's what he said\nWhat we have is a lot of people missing I Want to be very careful about numbers because are they missing because their loved ones can't contact them or are they missing because they were you know perished in the store\nAnd we need to have loved ones are missing or can contact them it's a it's true that cell phones are not working very well not only in Panama City but all over bake county so it remains really difficult to communicate and find relatives who may have stayed behind in the storm\nBut still you do get the feeling that the number of fatalities is going to go up and maybe way up when we start to get more information from the waterfront communities\nOr

Donald Wuerl over his role in covering up two different church sexual abuse scandals the first\nIn Pennsylvania was detailed in a nine hundred page report in August that outlines sexual abuse by priests in six dioceses over which world presided he was also accused of covering up allegations against his predecessor D.C.'s cardinal Theodore ... character was\n... ... is a young man who grow up in Pennsylvania and one of Donald worlds diocese and moved to Washington DC this summer he joined us from Washington DC thanks so much for being with us yeah it's good to be here tell us about your face which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that\nHaving a face has made me a better person and I think it has not effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out this summer about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania not far from places you know\nYeah it hurt reading the report because I was reading about these Paris is that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up the way to hear kids joke about all you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was\nActually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion and then I didn't learn honestly until recently that\nThe abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense\nWhat I think it was the early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing it wasn't something I'd never been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ...\nAnd a church or face [noise]\nI think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teaching of the Catholic Church\nMash did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh who has their own story to tell you know I did not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with\nDo you think the church cared more about itself as an institution and less about the people who had\nBeen harmed [noise] it certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nHearing that they spent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for\nThe heartbreaking abuse there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care\n[noise] do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with because of the Catholic Church's is all I ever\nWas involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new area and starting a new a new part of my life and since the breaking of these new stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God I still have a face and\nI just see much less of the connection between my

a contributing editor of Oxford American ... professor of English and creative writing at University of Mississippi joins us now from Oxford\nDo you tell me about your mouth or it's not a simple question is it\nOh not at all not at I look forward to it that my mother the incredible model and like most Americans she just had a rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patches she ... she was a sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life\nI think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now\nBut that readily practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gap an all out of the terror that I think she\nProbably did not want me to write into\n[noise] well um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't we go\nTo the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black women were dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know when I was around nine or ten she started to uh what me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police white people would be even a harsher and those beatings just things\nStarted to give progressive Lee wires and\nI think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town and her partner also started to get progressive we worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state will join us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the baby in June dirt from your mother the ... that she endured\nAll of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOf the things I just I just want to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cost just traumatic thing but I Will say the layers of particular kinds of abuse really personal and structural\nKids so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women's had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em any individual you started to start as a way of attempt in the high end attempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between of which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days\nAnd there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation and I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police\nUs about it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller like I Would be okay like people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body ...\nYeah [laughter] then we got to get the gambling none of that ad or your life oh man\nI'm by the time in my body broke my body literally broke from overused and wrote from not sleeping and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every\nCent that are made from a particular date until another date probably for like six years went to a casino and it was hard to write about\nThat harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about in that book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWhile I'm definitely the perpetrator but in my family you know I think\nBecause I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame\nWhen we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make we aren't able to keep right and especially if it's if it's tied to a kind\nOf like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself\nThat's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home that two hours filling absolutely like trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood my mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually\nStill the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about it\nStill can't really honestly talk about\nI don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you hear what she thinks\nI Love my mother's death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer redoing teacher and my mother not love me enough to instill a practice\nAt an early age and his books in some way is like her investment coming full circle she really believed that reading and writing to say and I don't know if that's\nTrue but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I want it to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better we can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's
