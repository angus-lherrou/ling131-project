World Service my guests today has become one of the world's leading public intellectuals who's focused much of his attention on identity how we humans see ourselves and others through the complex prism of race gender religion class and nationality\nFor Kwame Anthony Appiah the drive to dig deep into such questions comes from a very personal place the is the child of a so called mixed marriage his father was a lawyer and will connect ... politician in pre independence gone to\nHis mother was an English woman of Eris the classic stall Kwame Anthony Appiah was a gifted student who went to Cambridge University and became a professor of philosophy of law\nAt New York University He is a gay man who was married to his partner of more than two decades so his own life is a fascinating example of how complex on multi lead our sense of self can be\nAnd yet the way we humans define ourselves and define others often tends to be focused on the vision we use race religion on the class to separate us from then increasingly in this young century the politics of identity seems to be fueling conflict I hate\nSo is there an antidote to this preoccupation with group on tribe well Kwame Anthony Appiah joins me now welcome\nTo talk to the beer you have spent a great deal of your recent professional life thinking about identity and how each and every one of us labels ourselves\nSo let's start with a simple question how do you label you also [laughter]\nA gun at enough British by origin and that I live in the United states that's ... that gives me\nThree countries to talk about in terms of some sort of national origin\nTo you when you describe where you're from and and the sort of mixed nuts if your identity other ... are you thinking that you're sending signals to go into lucky to her about about who you are\nYes I think I'm sending signals I think that sort of as it were weak signals somewhere faraway planet or something because because they don't tell you as much as I think many people assume\nUh they they will so I I grew up in God and my father was going to end but that doesn't tell you very much about how interested I Am in God or it doesn't tell you how much I Know about guys as I said that that that is\nAnd so on many people that would be more involved with seems to know what their nationality is you know if it's at but I end up pretty quickly in a conversation I think you move beyond the the stereotypes into into more detail and then it doesn't matter so much that it's not all that helpful\nWould it be too simplistic to say that in in in all of your work on the race religion and creed as you put it on gender and all the different ways that we can\nIdentify ourselves to identify ourselves and others your conclusion is that frankly we roll so complex and so unique that almost any label we apply it in some way or rather misleading\nI think that's right if you take any bill the big labels that you know the race religion nationality I'm even talk you know one of those there's so much diversity within them\nThe same you know men they're all ... men and also all the same men is very different from one another women are very different from one another or people in Britain are different from what a lot of people in London a different from one another and a million ways\nSo that being told that somebody's a London I didn't actually give you a huge grip on anything a very important about them which doesn't mean that there are nine minutes when being alone there isn't a hugely important to people um they're a mayoral election since ... if you're a London that\nFrankly you could look beyond the shores of Europe to India where the current government uses nationalist and polarizing cultural messages\nAnd it does it but the point you alluded to earlier you ultimately are not ... I Believe that the trajectory of the human condition in ... in that positive sense toward a more universal list a more\nHumane understanding compassionate humanity I guess how can you square that with what you see well uh\nI I guess because I'm looking at it over a longer horizon than just five or ten years old penalty as I'm thinking about how much things have improved in these respect\nOr in many ways over the last century I'll say for example think about the massive improvement in the condition of waiting to ask people in many many countries over the last century and look at the massive reduction in a racial ah\nThe increase in coming together of Europe at the same at the moment of these moments of nationalism\nAnd putting it to one side which one has to do your pay is way more unified in the United uh than it was in the in the nineteenth century so uh or even in the middle eastern countries I think what do they say if you look over a long enough horizon\nYou can senior general tendency is in the direction that I Would regard as up\nOne area where I can see that you would find solace would be in the way in which certainly in the western world ah societies and cultures view a gender issues particularly sexuality I mean your your uh an infant very long time in out\nGay man you took advantage of America's change of laws that that you could Mario long term partner how far can we go with the notion that human beings are now free to choose their identities in ways that we never even thought for not just in terms of of\nSexuality but even in terms of a basic gender where now there is a a very powerful movement to to change the way the binary way we see men and women are a lot of people who define themselves as ... binary there are others who are transgender ring and society slowly appears to be moving\nTo to accept ban in New ways where does this end\nWell I don't think he ends the ... that there are two things at the airport but where it doesn't that doesn't then with the disappearance of identity we are reforming agenda system but we're not getting rid of gender altogether I ... I can ... I Believe that over the long haul into the future\nWe'll still have ... it'll be more complicated than the old simple binary system but there will be men and women and some people in between\nThe question is whether this is self\nIdentity and because the interestingly I I'm I'm blushing between different spheres but but I I'm mindful on ... not so long ago we spoke to a woman code ritual dollars though who\nIs white parents age but identified them indeed became an activist on behalf of the black community and and and\nLived a life as a black woman though when she was challenged about this because people realized eventually that she had two white parents it became a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say\nWhat being black is and she said look I I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore to that extent I'm black\nWell I think she's a very good case to thing\nTo think of these things as a matter of a negotiation you can't simply declare the meaning of your own race all on their own race as a social gathering you need to see if you if you didn't like where it's put you you need to persuade the well to change that is what trans people have done\nThe trick trans people have done what Rachel Dolezal didn't do which is they've\nCreated a movement to allow them\nTo be what they want to be an artist and they've asked us to change the system and that's I'm happy to respond affirmatively to that request and change the system I don't think it has any harm to me to buy masculinity to adapt system in that way and even if they did a little bit of how do I am asking them the I'd be happy because it's obviously very important to them\nIf racial do they all had could have waited a could've made these arguments on the side of the people in the gum the thing and if you could have done it in the weight of a little bit more\nStraightforward because what she was actually doing she knew involved\nConcealing some things that other people thought was important that she didn't think it was important and that's an interesting fact about that but unfortunately a black in America doesn't belong to her and so the only way can be changed in the direction that she wants and I'm ...
