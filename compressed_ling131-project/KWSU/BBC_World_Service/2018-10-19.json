among the lecture our own government at Harvard University in Cambridge\nTo begin by asking each of you will seize identity politics what do you mean by it Priya\nIdentity politics is I think a a ... that has been given and is used to describe\nPlanes for civil rights claims to full citizenship and claims to social justice and identity politics\nIs I think a somewhat ... which has been given to them on to equality and full citizenship and to social justice and I I'm not happy with the ... because I think it's used in ways\nThat are very questionable and not have less to do with the identity of a sudden that in with questions of justice\nWe can talk about that is a little bit more Adrian past what does it mean to you\nThat's politics is really about individualized so I didn't see individuals are small groups very often so cool minorities that's all right the ... sort of quality of inclusion and democracy but I think there's a danger that\nDifference is now elevated of a commonality that we're stressing Everytime makes it different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds us together citizenship\nHumanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are part of the same work places and also the same communities in countries so there's a problem I think and mass its response individual lives and but I think it's an individualized response rather than a more communal collective Islam yeah ...\nYou know to me into politics as crops two very different phenomena that are going on to the same\nTime it's a lot of confusion stems from mixing goes up so I'm Wondering what we're seeing at the moment is a lot of a minority groups claiming equality claiming riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing discrimination and on the other hand I think we are seeing\nAs sort of movements but that's Adrian just said I sort of trying to respond to the basis of liberal democracy from being about individuals to being ... about ... to ... to ... elements of the state line of try\nTo [noise] I think the term it co here's around the idea that we are defined by our power relationships and that who we are is primarily dictated by groups into which we were born in that way I regarded as anti individual for ma'am part\nJust about any group that I was born into female American what have you I Would like out of that is I find it confining and my idea of what identity\nIt's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you up like a wise or whether you're when you're in a situation you gender and sexuality whatsoever\nStyle real victims those real oppression exploitation\nBut the way to go over that is to name it as an injustice die affect everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always appealing to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ... a lot of that\nThat doesn't ask you if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your impression was an offense against humanity many people were just in ...\nLook business love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't you think was between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what has to sexual swans and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but there is real discrimination real injustice and we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit toward a more justify what looked like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big thick\nAnd very nice movie which is autobiographical about a Pakistani origin American than a comedian who falls enough with a white um how can we go into sort of grammatical Australia they have no partners [laughter]\nUm I was amazed by the way in which bad movie which tells in the mainstream romantic comedy a story of an interracial marriage started to be attacked from the left saying what isn't the problematic\nThat this round protecting us has to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden in that debate the right thing\nWho cares if you find somebody who he was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and was parts of the left\nBut talking about food that was problematic exercise leave for me is the crux of disagreement about what the side of the ... I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between\nCultures rather than one where everybody has to stay in the lane and devoid cultural appropriation that I needed a picture in the movie of interracial relationship is probably ... identity politics just become another form of intolerance\nThink that you know it's interesting that the Ron Paul has come up I find some of the discussions off why can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value as\nThe way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... like a kind of cheesy a wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I left on the left all my life who even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of\nCommonality is very different from the reality of hierarchical differentiation and exploitation and we have to address the fact\nOf political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the same him sheets about all falling in love and living happily ever after I mean we don't\nG. T. rights and the way that change but feel free to comment on what pre as well\nI think the what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not\nVenture off even buy a millimeter and that's a turn off it also create\nA social atmosphere of fearful is on a an an ordinary social level not necessarily just on special little social media boards I think that\nWe are generally much more anxious about socializing with people who are different from us be that to sexual preference or race or ethnicity and ah you know if you're at a party\nAnd there is somebody across the room you're white person dares to someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani\nBut you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're gonna think twice about approaching them and not a big ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word you might express something that's a little you know not all perfect\nThere's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying\nAnd they make people socially fearful Asia\nIt's intolerance outline will just mentioned it's also a political correctness on ... pops and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together that somehow the differences defined as more than the cannot too close to a real differences out to be celebrated\nBut they also they're coming out and she says I read we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring down into the Democratic political contest I'm off even those notions of citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus that shouldn't be warm\nBut the memories ... thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's the way that politics has become\nSo do I ... I really would like example is I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I hadn't ringing about authoritarianism and lack of commonality and differences\nBut I'm not hearing an example of the only example that would get on with black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nSo that me give you a couple of examples but first what I wanted to make the but I think a black lives matter in many ways it's an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to an understanding\nBut it's absolutely right which is that best disproportionate police violence against African Americans and that this is a a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the number is also true but the majority of the people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the relatively small portion of the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to be a vacation if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and visit particularly deepen justice\nBut you know what if you are a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually ... white people who got shot by the police as well\nI Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this high off ... people have never lived in Mount a cultural religious monolingual states this is new to the new situation that we find ourselves and why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nOne of the reasons why I think it's just 'cause I guess has 'cause a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between my city and other\nGroups in society simply not on the function political parties trade unions churches synagogues temples most some of them may still be growing up on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions and Ken situations in the communities are not working and I think that's why people fail\nThere's a sense of powerlessness the sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized and I think the problem with this uncertainty is is if I'd have finished an exclusive\nBriefly ... I think mass migration has something to do with it we're talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier Russia\nWell it's hard to disagree with the premise I Do think that the tree or democracies in the world was founded on a multi ethnic multi cultural tough conception of themselves and thank God we've started to challenge that we now live in a tidy sum which most people ... the idea of it the more to ethnic society so that if something has talked quite new Korea\nThink we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth\nAnd one of the ways in which that are addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that way by is minorities and black people and women and ... people and gay people who are ruining lives with their\nFor any quality and suffering okay plenty to think about that thank you for ... panel\nGrandfather Gopal yes among Lionel Shriver in Adrian pops we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let us know what you think of the program or any ideas topics he likes to look into you can email us that the real story at BBC don't care what you ... me ... and if you enjoy the program we have a podcast you can subscribe to\nJust such a BBC the real story in your poll coughed up [noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

institution and nuts and feelings do methane is angel belonging to be unable or unwilling to place to people to communities and countries much as we can all the latest feeling out of politics they gotta\nThe obvious question that full it's not his belongings onto wet and he's part of the reason for identity politics that actually people expressing\nWhether it was the religion didn't express who they were [noise]\nWell you had a noted about how their duties or the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland uh after the good friday agreement shouldn't saying on the one hand and the UP on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far end of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties and I think that's because Northern Ireland what the place and and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly\nYou're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation\nAnd northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tribe then they want representatives\nWho are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interests not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for the old political policies because if you say they shrill voice is a very clear that on the door a bull in some ways it works if you'll\nNever end to remove the in India and you are preaching to the idea of an overarching Hindu history to India a Hindu view of India\nIt when states well one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and we we do naturally I think as as a species break up into what are often very competitive calm\nI'm confused I thought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem but I Would just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups it's a natural tendency of people to especially when the\nLarger amount gum is just a bit too big to get your head around to break into smaller groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's all politics happens because those tribes are bad but although tribes are okay\nHumans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who have close to them as possible so that starts off with a family at some point it becomes a village it might become a particular religious or ethnic group and the question is how do we deal with this in highly diverse society in a productive manner\nA one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging and to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen you look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years I don't think that's realistic because actually especially in the age of globalization nationalism retain an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me the best response\nIs to try and domestic hated behalf wild feast of nationalism to try and claim is for sales to make it inclusive to say that either hire a collective\nUh it does have level of the kingdom of looking at a state uh but obviously we fight for inclusion of all different route under that common identity and how do you make that journey from being a constant public and a member of the metropolitan elite today and if you like a flag waving patriots [noise]\nUm but I think patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its fold or well it's you know adopt a side of the history but if you love your country and you love the people of your country wherever they from you can also respect patriots relive that country it's a question of mutual respect\nTo the other hand around so bad I don't think anybody saying that you love around that area and how do you enjoy it isn't the arrogance of toy what's wrong and loving your country and its\nPeople and don't accuse people of identity politics what I'm saying that your national Zuma view opposed to nationalism I imagine you are and your your your um your your national named called you are saying making my country but the majority of\nOf Hindu majority of them so I look at nationalism\nThat's something that had served the stuff that's in the anti colonial struggle but today it has become a very deeply dangerous beast what\nIs the writer response will be ... into it but it is the or the national Congress party bedside but we're all Indians respectable\nThat he's not he's not true and it's not as though the older a form of national lives in the Congress party didn't have an ... elements to it the one that we do our days of areas of angry as well is that what age and if if I can bring it back then in a sense that there is a we we do\nGood thing but an identity that takes in a single mother with one leg is not necessarily such a good thing\nWell 'cause I think the problem is how do we build bridges between all those groups then sometimes you need something more overarching that can build a bridge you know we can be worked since we can be people of of a place like a village or a city we can be lumped in us we can be people from Manchester\nBut also sometimes that national element is still within the cross 'cause it's found bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further the kind of cosmopolitan and they also spoke about that can doesn't have to what can be a bit abstract I think at the European level isn't that are so I think a lot of people feel European\nBritish or German or French but I also feel I have a low cost them to see these layers of possible so that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we managed to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with its great diversity of people here and the answer is but\nIf everybody identify primarily with a top national try and\nSay I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu and Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough in common in this country to live together productively in peacefully whereas if we've had our sense of collective pride and the level\nWhich coincide with the actual ... ... ... doesn't everybody carry multiple and of course and that type of thing should between the identity is what she choose for yourself\nOn the ones that have foisted the of course we do in the uh people like ... like Martin Luther king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way that I fight for the cause of people who have my identity is to emphasize our common interest as Americans and other than just an emphasized the ways\nIn which discrimination against this group goes against the ideal of the whole and under the counter vision which says let's celebrate some national identity groups to such an extent\nAnd let demonize any form of collective flowing above it level to such an extent but we no longer have what we need in order to sustain a common ... that's\nA bit of a false distinction there goes one can argue that the version of British national at something that led to breakfast at which is a big nationalism was on the paint by a\nSome nationalism that anything less nationalism the way the Brexit vote broke down there is a clear correlation between what you would call something nationalism that having nationalism and British nationalism which led to breakfast\nAnd so again if I don't think we can have you know how to take a break that angle down into that I I'd rather live in the wild takes a while I mean it it actually quite a lot of people crossing\n... is different notions\nOf what an Asian might be my understanding of an inclusive nation is one that doesn't discriminate and I think there was some amount of spin a phobia eating the Brexit vote and secondly one bed recognizes that the international sphere can be when when but you can fight the interest of your own country\n[noise]\nBut I look into news day on the BBC what service would pursue jak James Coburn great to have you with [noise]\nWe'll hear how the me too movement has reached

Afghanistan\nAnd a lot of districts in Afghanistan the way it works is that the administrative headquarters and a circle with a radius of about maybe half a kilometer around it is controlled by the government and then the villages are controlled by the Taliban\nSo by that reckoning I think we can say that over half the national territory is currently one way or another in Taliban hands\nMore on that later in our program\nWe begin with official data from China showing that economic growth slowed to its weakest right in the decades\nThis was in the third quarter of this year at one time growth

to keep in mind that six point five percent is still quite fast growth and that's among the fastest in the world so there's still plenty of resources for out down investments in London and I haven't seen a lot of that\nAnd I'm going to ask you a question which I'm going to us and then do you as well um six point five percent do you believe it I mean Chinese figures you know this is a one party

the conservative member of parliament Jacob ... smoke\nSo I asked him how likely is it that this proposed extension to the transition period until the end of twenty Twenty one would be acceptable to him and his allies\nBut I think it'd be very difficult to get through parliament because\nThe extension comes with a price tag\nFor the price tag is can be harder than our current membership fee because it will be under a new multi a new financial framework and we will not have any say in how the new budget is set\nOf each other that we currently hopping from two to retain the rebate and we
