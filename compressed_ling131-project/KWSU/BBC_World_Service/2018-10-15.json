ethnicities so how do you go about building booze coalitions that cooperation\nWell so I guess I have to roll back for a moment and just things just that as you mentioned you're familiar with my writing in my writing the whole point\nOf intersection holiday is to talk about the kind of color coalitions that are necessary in order to realize are\nI stated values and objective\nUm there are many applications of intersection out any across any number of differences and cross any number\nOf forms of discrimination one of the points that I made and the New York times article that I wrote two weeks ago or what to say that the failure of the coalition between anti racist and feminist was one of the factors that led to the elevation of Clarence\nWhat I argue there was that there is a common history of anti racism and feminism found and the fact that I'm very term\nSexual harassment and very knowledge meant that sexual harassment is in fact discrimination\nWas largely set forth by African American women plaintiffs who are experiencing discrimination when they when they were working there is a long history of African American women bringing gender into anti racism and bringing anti racism into feminine\nShoulder is but but but some African American activists women feminists and civil rights campaigners\nHave looked at the history of looked as you say the failure at times of of white feminist to make common cause with the black sisters I'm frankly some of them have enough I'm quoting here timely Gordon who says\nI find myself at the end of my into into fictional feminist road it's time to go back into survival mode\nDue to the dumpster fire and live by a\nBlack feminist agenda and\n[laughter] and I mean I could build is laying\nPeople who actually and say the opposite I think the point is you know and and I find that very interesting um folks who are concerned about too much group ness\nUm respond to moments like these by showing that there are few individuals who are acting differently of course we don't all think of like\nI'm so having a quote from someone who is exaggerated by um the lack of allies ship of of white women and it's not surprising I often\nFrustrated by it as well in fact I'm only forty eight percent white women actually believe Dr blazing Ford there's far greater racial gap\nIn American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean a gender instance significant that doesn't mean the patriarchy isn't working through it doesn't mean that we don't need an intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same time I know this grind the problem\nI I get I get the intersect now the argument that you could bring different groups of press people together to make common cause of Mac can make a very big difference I get but I guess what I'm\nI'm moving to waters are asking you how you reach out if you can reach out at all to those particular groups particularly maybe white working class people men and women interesting\n... is there any way do you see that you can use your arguments and your powers of persuasion to make inroads amongst those groups if we pull into groups\nOr many of us are I think one of the challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side of the idea that there\nBeen efforts to reach out across groups the idea that the civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was a\nMultiracial and in fat and bipartisan so um our our challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest\nThat that we're all just separate groups and we're not really engaging an effort to to reach across many of the difference and\nI think in fact uh the last week opens up even more possibilities are\nEvery thing that we've been seen since you asked that many women are particularly those that fifty three percent that in that in fact voted for Trump\nOr may be rethinking that but let let's not you know see pie in the sky here race and it's always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for us\nHow do you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the present day how do you feel about ... with the midterms coming up his reruns of the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this quote\nYou know the whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women and it'll GDP Americans not as well known since I said I go up votes from every demographic\nDo you see Obama or some body that you know Democrats need to listen to and be mindful of because he had the right approach or do you think in retrospect\nBronco bomb uh actually one rather cooling off the he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American politics\nWhat they can stop for president to actually change the structures of American politics um I have my disagreements a\nRocket bomber on on a range of issues some of them having to do I'm with a failure to actually even\nAny qualities um I had took issue with him for example on my brother's keeper it was a program that was a racial justice program but in excluded women and girls but that was a minor I'm sort of different um within a broader reality and that\nWe are a country that shapes ourselves around certain values and I think he tried to perform that and it is true that he was able to win the support the vote of\nAh the white working class was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania I'm In Michigan that were really important so it is true it is possible to win votes and to create coalition across race and class and he's in good reminder of the fact that this isn't an inevitable dimension of American politics\nAnd just the final thought on that as we go into elections who what where in election season and the Democrats are trying to create a winning progressive\nCoalition that is interesting isn't it when Ron Brown steam reflected on this with some figures from the Pew foundation recently said\nA ... democratic voters he said I clearly divided he said Democrats must weigh the coach tree liberal instincts are mostly secular ring of upscale white with the often more traditional inclinations of African American and Latino support says that\nAgain in this world of of of sort of into sexuality and I'm I'm group based politics is he's a very complex a complex relationships in attitudes and values isn't it\nAnd I I don't I make the complexity even greater I'm the most mobilize piece of the Democratic coalition is African American women they're the ones that gave the vote that the victory to Roy Moore\nUS Senator who was the first Democrat to the elected from Alabama in a generation on their black women all over the ballot so the real question and challenge and\nHow can we not only use black women as the wheels on the bass but how do we actually put them in the driver's seat what are the agenda and that\nActually speak to them if we can figure that out will probably be able to figure out how to sneak across the working class\n'cause black women are disproportionately working class will probably be able to build those ties that at one point made the Democratic coalition a winning political mobile mobilize a coalition that's what we're looking for in this in this midterm election we'll see\n[noise] distribution of BBC World service in the U.S

others want to get that data from you you may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person ones that are corporation wants her government wants it\nAs Ken burners Lee has publicly not only develop these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it economically important to scale that's a sign and I think we have to have is\nThe most simple level it is forcing Internet uses regular citizens like your eye to opt in to the data harvesting model that Facebook Google and everyone else is using rather than opting out as it is now kind of gently being posted\nThat's absolutely correct and we don't want it to be a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property negotiations all the time but I think\nIt's starting in medical data you know there's a huge societal gain as our bodies become digitally read out to the sharing of that data because you can only understand you relative to other humans\nBut right now you're in danger if you share your data from insurance companies from your employer from all kinds of things\nSo it's a social good to protect the individual so that they will make a socially generous donation of their data because they're not afraid that there will be things that happened to them a better bad in their future so\nI think the European Union in some ways is further along than the United states but I I think the scale of the uh catastrophes that are happening on the net including the very attacks on the foundation of our democracy have open people up\nInternet pioneer and would be reform Larry ... now it's all of you know I commend isn't just about identity theft in data harvesting there is another problem some reckon demonstrate to buy the emergence of so called information warfare fake news\nAnd as soon as the founder scout AI it's a media company focused on the future of technology and she's been studying the way the boats when Ammon nippy electing the way we talk and debate on social networks\nI've done a lot of announcers especially interested in the last year and what we found is that generally if you're looking at a conversation on Twitter about a large cultural phenomenon so for example the ... Nike controversy or a lot of the conversations on Robert Miller that go on online I bet\nFound you know one tweet by Trump that was promoted by sixty percent botched but generally ...\nPercent of the people retreating what Donald Trump said we'll machines\nYes yeah it's important to keep that in mind when you're encountering what seemed to be really angry or division of comments on line is that\nThere's a very good chance that those comments could be written or constructed with the delivered intent to angry you or to garner your support right and it happens on both the right and the left and the idea is to divide those two groups of people further into harden and calcified their beliefs are that in order to change their behavior and specific ways\nIt's extraordinary isn't it I mean you just take a moment to think about what that means if you were to transform Twitter or Facebook these platforms into a physical community we'd be turned into a crowd of people Seventy percent of which would be machines\nYou know it'd be like walking around in your daily life and Seventy percent of people that you meet are real people right they looked like real people they talk like real people but they're actually just actors who are trying to change your perspective or beliefs about the world [noise] kinda like living in the Truman Show\n[laughter] it is sold in the living dead might be another movie about or just people presumably done on this term but they still don't understand that I mean you and other political commentator out there having that conversation of telling people these things but regular folks don't get that presumably because they're still talking to each other at least they sing them\nWell yeah I mean I when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people respond to these people or thoughts or algorithms whatever they might be and the retreat them do use their messaging they'll promote their messaging they'll get angry at them\nThe way that you create news stories in today's media ecosystem is by creating a trending topic\nAnd so the ... century act I like the ... or the spark that lights the fire\nAnd then normal people get involved and it takes up steam and picked up steam and at that point media companies are looking at what's trending on Twitter Google News is based on often on what's trending on Twitter or Facebook and those stories then become mainstream news right so that then becomes an accepted story and it's all essentially been architect id\nBy a group of fake accounts on social media\nThe mainstream news meter was complicit in that eventually as everyone else\nI Would love to see a major media company out them take a stand about reporting on Twitter controversies I think that'd be a very powerful statement to make as a media company\nBut it hasn't yet not yet buried under ... who's this\nTrying to help verify people's identities on the Internet I think one of the\nReasons that people are so excited about the idea of the block chain generally are very you\nKnow it creates this arc de centralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity\nUm with the ... pretty pretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into and and get around that but the whole idea of the black chain is that every person has a node right and not know drafted denser identity but all of those no they're connected and every other note also has a copy of who that first note is so\nDecentralized yeah there will be in a decentralized the filter on I\nThink it's the central and but it's also you can delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different note and therefore you can see oh this is the same at butler that has been talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did the interview over here and they hear this conversation or exchange that they have\nSo that is the future that is a potential future for one way in which we could at least improve the architecture the social kind of social platforms absolutely yeah are you optimistic that this is going to ... that we have a way through because ultimately we've all got to live with the Internet is not going to go away we invented coming\nI'm very optimistic I think we we live in a really interesting time for the Web where\nI think we'd outgrown the architecture of the Internet but the good news is that people like him are coming along and really really care about and focused on how do we reinvest like what is it looked like to reinvent the Internet that actually built to do what it does today there are a lot of people out there that are very passionate about doing that so yes I Am absolutely optimistic about it\nAn optimistic berets and dissident who like Larry small things the beginnings of change but not even with them expected to happen quickly\nNachos technology it's going to require major international country by country regulation of legal changes if a bill of rights there's nothing more fundamental\nAnd it's going to take years if not decades to move in that direction but the solutions are beginning to be on the horizon\nInternet pioneer Larry small I guess we should stress that this is just one vision a point of view that he's putting food there will be many no doubt from Internet firms and elsewhere who disagree with a design flaw teased describing but whatever size you settle the debate about the future of the vulnerabilities is clearly a key part of the public conversation now\nWith the Internet changes will not expect coals Vernon\nUtah we hope you've enjoyed it and we will be back [noise]\nTen am in
