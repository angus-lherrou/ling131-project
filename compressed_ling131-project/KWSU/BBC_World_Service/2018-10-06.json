they've been keeping everyone quite busy and I that basically you know and it gives you an idea of like you know how uh how much like cyber to his now are very much at an essential part of the Russians are tools to advance a they're a\nForeign policy agenda and they use it quite at all and you know and the all the ongoing whether the conflicts or like Jupiter the concessions that they want to achieve\nAnd all those potentially being spied a poem able to resist first tools effectively\nWell basically I mean uh\nIf you do the thing is with the outside of crimes and cyber attacks is like more often than not uh they would be like you know what I\nRead the infiltrate into the system without you know do you think about it so it's very challenging to know about or the infiltration into the system but of course you know I think what happened yesterday kind of\nFlight raises more awareness on the Russian activity and I think even though you know some might argue that Russian is not very much like a shame the nation\nThat is that does called adaptation of damage and that does such a date for the day the way for a more economic sanctions which would be like really a challenge for the Russian economy now\nLet me bring my guess into my own sort of question what's on your mind\nWell I was struck I mean I'm I'm a big fan of John le Carre and and and I don't know much about sort of the modern the modern equivalent of fine but I was struck by that they've ... released by the I think the Netherlands I'm\nSort of at least about about the kind of how basic it seemed like they were doing you know how to go ... full of equipment or a jacket covering an antenna and and that they were\nIt seems strange to me that we're talking about cyber attacks but then they had a very physical presence in the same time and I wondered about that is that how\nMost of them are done or is it and start to just ... by by that these people I Believe like you know these sorts of attacks that combined both a ... so you have to do some sort of like a fun activity combine it with online activity or what happened yesterday with it of relations\nA show that can be for like a an embarrassment I Would say for Russians indicted just because they are they've been very keen and the recent he has to show supremacy and it's not good for you and when you know you're caught with like a taxi receipts and like you know all these things and to both of your car it shows that\nProbably there's some reckless are going on from the Russian party but also when you are engaged in so many operations across the ... and\nThen you know a sooner or later you would leave some ah you know in the disputed wide I Would call them digital breath comes but also some physical evidence that would then ah basically to what happened yesterday and I have to say like you know like the a\nNice as spies west called in April and the only had about a a decent yesterday so it shows you know that there's been a lot of ah coordination between these governments going on behind the scenes that we don't know about\nPatricia I'm just on a purely practical level um\nIt seems to me that they they it it is a kind of terrorism on what it is it seems to be doing is seeping into our everyday lives ... center we don't know if I'll Facebook on our on through the been infiltrated we've seen\nReally what looked like company attempts that have been really quite effective and to me what I'm setting in the story of it's interesting to me that the the narrative of Russia seems to be almost more powerful than Russia itself I mean is there activity about building a kind of virtual Russia in people's minds\nYou think well I think of course like you know I ...\nIn a way what happened yesterday wasn't about us and by the same time if you look at it from the Russians perspective having all these governments\nComing together right and accusing Russia also puts Russia and then and the way and a good place like you know that managed to get back together all these governments and to have all these like press conferences like actual the good old I guess we see it like that\nDoes put them in a good place by the end of the day or you know when you are or you know I called you know I Hope Savage times uh then it's kind of\nA you know like with what we saw yesterday was that can help them through their way I kind of like put things into perspective and probably you know what they've been trying so eager to lead to prove that they are so great\nWhen you look at the main figures in the Kremlin when you look for ... for example she doesn't look very embarrassed [laughter]\nYeah well that's obviously not very surprising right like you know whether I Would look behind\nThe scenes that maybe people are looking at ...\nI'm sure they didn't receive then use our like happy faces I'm sure that was like something called a a you know international backing especially that you are you know when you're trying to show off your are your kids and then you get called in and it's a ... a at times that's not really a great day for you\nAre but that's also like you know over the like the the Russian or an additive old ways you know whenever that calls and there's an accusation is older denial it's always like you know are they mark either the ah the investigation they always say there's no blues over\nYour see although we did see you know the force by the pictures and all of these things so that's that's not really surprising OK\nPatricia went for them not just as I said I Do find that I'm finished that it it it just keeping into our everyday lives unless things that you think we could practically due to to to push by not necessarily finding things but within how we live our lives that allows to push back against this time it's\nI think that's a very good question I and I think you know a one of the things that we could do I as citizens and our daily life it's back to something called digits and hygiene\nSo very small things that sounds like you know a changing your passwords often backing up your dates are being a little bit kind of like vigilant and care for of how you deal with your uh online life like the same way though you did with you know for example the safety of your house right he wouldn't leave your a door open\nAnd I expect that you know you are safe there kind of like back to these minimums things\nThat would I mean there has been some studies saying that if like people collectively like you know kind of energy back to this um I did just that hygiene you could limit up to eighty percent of the side to side with crimes and then the focus would be on the more complex than geopolitical level is not acquire\nLike this sophisticated level of sophistication\nDonut geopolitical level do you see any sort of any move towards some sort of regulation of cyberspace\nYes well a that's a very good point I think you know what happened yesterday you should be put in the context of what's going on at the international level so I later this month Russia is planning on submitting to drop to good use and\nTo the U.N General assembly a one on basically imposing code of conduct for house they should have with a to get a you know each other into cyberspace but also one or two off adjusting and youth cybercrime convention to the place\nIn the in that had not been linked in the media to what happened yesterday and I think um so the Russian activity and like you know age they wanted to get them but also they want to come to the negotiating table from the position of power\nAnd that has actually been said by as senior advisor to president but then saying that the upper paying something and the information every now that would let them speak to the Americans that equal\nSave ... on on on one hand and also the western states obviously they're trying to push back against each ad is really just do they wanted to kind of show what the Russians are really doing and then try and get\nThe country you know that are not you know Russia or China or like with the western states that are in the middle of the un formally undecided the kind of like you know to as best I thought you could easily argue that\nPoint thank you very much for coming in a way to attack by a a ... house you're listening to the BBC well seven so I'm Judy more with

activity\nThe Chinese police carried out a really sweeping around to harass in multiple cities um arrested feminist activists and they ended up focusing on five young women in three different cities\nUm and brought the five women to Beijing where they put them in detention and the same detention center\nI'm and held them there for thirty seven days and and the jailing actually productive at an enormous global outcry um ... which created this global diplomatic pressure\nI I'm ... ... says the government made the unprecedented move of releasing their women\nIt was on President wasn't it was completely unexpected\n[noise] yes because the women look like they were on course to being criminally prosecuted and facing a jail term at five years or even more um but but the jailing of these women just angered so many people inside and outside China and it it ended up galvanizing the feminist committed in in China in particular\nA much more broadly defined clearly are the ones who made headlines for the reasons you just described how much would they be representing the day to day lives of Chinese women [noise]\nWell this is the thing first of all um these are just five women and they were almost randomly selected a by the authorities to send a message to other young women who are increasingly attracted by the cause of women's rights\nAnd um ever since the jailing of these five young women more and more young women in China have been drawn to the movement and it has just been growing 'em in momentum and continues to grow today\nLiterally to bring in other words too as well I Am a maybe a question to do\nThose kind of am I wanted to put a growing today I mean how how can we see this in China now how would the effect of me to kind of on\nThe ground [noise] yeah well I mean it's so interesting because originally when made two went viral globally I thought that that it can't take off to that extent in China because there's so many obstacles\nThere is very very heavy Internet censorship there's no press freedom so unlike in the U.S where on the news about Harvey Weinstein again you know sexually abusing all these famous Hollywood actresses that was broken by news organizations\nBut there is on the news organizations in China are basically now propaganda outlets they're not allowed to do this kind of reporting for the most part\nUm and then then finally there is no independent judiciary so any victims of sexual abuse in China\nHas virtually no recourse and yet made to has really taken off in spite of all of the obstacles and and today you still see young women emerging up all across China\nUm across sectors even across class coming out with their accusations their personal stories of sexual abuse\nFor me to post to being sense of my own\nWell they a lot of them have been censored but it's not a blanket censorship on on the me too harsh tax so\nThere are definitely stories that are getting through 'em and and also the feminist activists themselves are very creative and imaginative about finding new ways to get around to censorship\nUm for example one young feminists when when I made to hash tag was being censored um really aggressively one activist came up with the idea of using him oh jeez\nI'm for the characters that sound like me too and Chinese so she used a rice and Bonnie image eat me to\nGet around and and at at work for a while but then the then it'll hit right Patricia\nI'm just wondering whether this movement to give them some ended by the fact that um\nBut in more than ... than the than they might have been a generation of but whether this played into it that's all\nWell I think it may it it's really hard to tell it at this point if there's any direct correlation it may have played a role because there have been studies that show that um when there's only one child and that the child has a daughter\nThat she doesn't have to compete with a brother for parental investment\nAnd so she may be better educated than she would have otherwise been had she had a brother or more brothers [noise]\nWhy do you think bill ... apparently so troubled by this I mean when you look at home and you're still ideology that doesn't necessarily say to you that you should be what rate of of women campaigning for equality or does it\nKnow of course not and this is why the jailing of these young feminists and twenty Fifteen provide such outrage because the Chinese government itself was founded on the principle of gender equality and it's written into the constitution of the People's Republic of China\nAnd in the early communist era of course one of the mouths of domes famous sayings is that women hold up half the sky so that was what the Chinese people were taught\nAnd ... for several decades in the in the fifties sixties and seventies um and women were assigned jobs and they were a there was a lot more a gender parity in terms of pay well everybody was poor but\nBut there wasn't just a huge and growing gender gap which really began with the onset of market reforms in China\nUm but but we're we're the onset of market reforms it means that the gender discrimination against women has has grown and financially and that's one of the grievances that the main grievance of these young feminists\nThank you very much for coming on a letter home printer or just on me to say thank you very much to Patricia ... husband fuel company this morning and thank you for listening to this additional weekend back at the same time tomorrow religious international news was next here

morning and wish there was someone to share it with me but I Am I learned a doctoral learn to [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThe bird which is fairly low thank you very typical would you say is that to some of the cycle of chasing learning it feels like\nI was like it I think they know and well we're in today well I think the opposite of London and\nWhat would you say\nThis happened notice how can is a real sense of learning or nurses happiness\nJak king the only thing to house check from the BBC with me Cody Hammons today we're discussing the results of all study the b._b._c. lending us experiment and professor of mine ... one of the team he's been analyzing the data is with me\nAnd we'd jak UC seems to be spending so much time on his own but I was interested to see the in the study not everyone thinks that loneliness is about being on your own today no no\nA sort of participants believing deadline and this is about being on your own but all the rest associated with very different things\nAnd I was surprised to see that for the one percent of the people who responded told us they think that learning is can sometimes be positive that seem surprising when it's such an unpleasant feeling\n[noise] has so much is a little bit like a social first I'd say so when you're very very Thursday it's not pleasant of course but it's there for a reason it's there to tell you you need to drink your body is is aching for that drink\n'em and you do it and it's gone I'm learning is is a little bit like that in the sense that yes it is painful and it has to be painful so that you pay attention to what's happening in what's lacking\nBut as long as you respond to it by redirecting your attention to others and to your social connections it should go away and it should be fine um so it's not necessarily negative when in fact it can sometimes be positive because if it leads to an anticipation of social connection for example\nBut of course where it goes wrong is where are they you don't pay attention to those signs or you can't because for example like jak as we heard just now you you have no ... no sufficient mobility no sufficient resources to actually be able to connect to others\nNow this was a global Saudi and people from all over the well chose to take part did you find that people everywhere experience learning a well\nThe short answer is yes we did find learning us in every country and in every age group all over the world in terms of age we can also say that the aged trend that we spoke about earlier was the same in every country the only minor differences was that in some countries the the\nThan than in others but at the trend is I'll as they are but we also found that culture I can make a difference\nNow there were nine countries where they had enough people taking part to make some compassion\nAnd levels of letting us well almost the same and the u._k. to us from India I Would think it just the slightly lower levels in these eight and now this isn't a representative sample of calls but I wanted to know whether this made any sense to talk to my taste Lucas and from the at the university who helps him he said and as far as mental health and young people\nThis isn't the first time that um this is being highlighted statistics me feeling talked about the proportion of people that we're experiencing loneliness old at the time most of the

interesting that the research now is reinforcing this passion again\nI'm why do you think that that might be slightly level of letting us any of that because they don't say never many levels are at

transport sector is a a big country bitter into the field to\nCredits yes so for me I think it's very important that we have an active policy towards thing getting new technology that drives the green

twenty Thirty years to being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of health climate friendly country in LA\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift\nWhat's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big energy transition now from fossil fuels than being depended on importing fulfills funeral in in many countries to want to be\nEnergy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of renewable energy that's holding you transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in the right person it's happening in Germany that's going to change the markets\nTo which we tell our petroleum at the moment as far as you\nCan sense should the new ... new exploration licenses for it and places like the parents see in the ...\nI Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe it's sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we have to say yes to a new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the barn seek today they will be still be producing in twenty seven\nTwenty eight days and that is [laughter] a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day one of the world should really be toward zero zero climate guests mission\nCan cause ... well I think we have to see it on a great to scale because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounds based on coal in the works\nBut I Do not oil we're talking about first of all\nMy point is that if you have replaced\nCoal plants root for example gas or even oil there will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the word greener refers to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with\nUm when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce themselves enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agreement society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually it's yeah do both\n[laughter] ... Christopher in this in this moment of transition it probably makes sense then driven the parents see because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than so many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited have long a county and others can argue that got full replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the tragedy and we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and ah\nIf I can draw on the ... when I was next incident and I came back a few years\nAnd I thought so do you think the u._s. should do something about it than not you know China should do something about it because they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and I feel if I was in office for last week and it was at a summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that nor with the bad guy at the put it into words of the student I when I talk to them today and told them I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford\nMaking a plan to get our fault that feels good to\nUh would look at the time for him because he could at least but says well it could be draining on two twenty seven to ... yeah it will it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency they say it's still in twenty fifty\nOne third of energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noisy globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it remember that is based if we're going to do a big big job to do to increase renewables about six thousand percent\nUnless it's a huge huge drop ... on on how well do you want to do I just mentioned also stuff\nAnd we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is to know is small and we'd be debating and those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures\nBut it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment house hostage being built a new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil team competition with the do as a politician and in a country like no way would you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green it's still difficult Patel they thought is\nHow to anybody else can I buy and well it's difficult in our way that it's become nice to have I been working environmental issues for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment then\nIt's become ... but I think it is they are in other countries actually done in Norway and it's important to understand that why why do you think that well because we have been producing country for so long and it seems to a large part of\nWho we are and how we identify ourselves suddenly\nTo underline that we're not talking about shutting down the protection that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more like a feel for the future can convince them that\nWe have to look on what are our options what's the odds of renewables for example where our disgusting to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable but where do you have to do so well uh you get to a perhaps\nIf you're lucky from a organic waste and it's part of the circle but ah if not you have to produce it by making some of our lands part of that ... de Soleil production instead of making food\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and if you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that they now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry\nAnd we see that that ... that's called actually knew now they changed the name it's part of that strategy because they understand they are also part of the green shift so my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process\nAnd oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make them for more\nGreen gay or at the same time we have to address DCSS easy you because carbon capture and storage of carbon capture and use it as both a central themes in deterrence ... into the ... than no trial doing it

algae was from the burned see is like another new regions they stack them up on each other and they thrive when it's cold and it's dark so this could be one part of the solution there's a lot of

actually use\nIs getting down to the details again and his staff has been focused on in order for Twenty years I think that also I needed to challenge to politicians here with a greater times because I don't think when you were saying this religion is more oil and gas I don't think\nWomen know what the harm is doing to climate change is if you're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to the times for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you

all the solutions for a rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should ... certain areas certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars as it is an example would be creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house building we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and shift because for a shift nation that and I was being so\nVery because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\n[noise] well I think because he want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security of supply will come from a new renewable knocked to develop new pipelines with gas and I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because\nOil and gas fields when the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries for really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway they have a lot of innovation and development to send me have a lot of tourists may or may actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other issue is we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of a nod in Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them they're looking at other things to work on so if you were an engineer in the in the room so I think he would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFurther than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nCan't government's fault no no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the developments in the er and the American I'm a business so I mean this is something we have to strive to shift to the degree and shift to\nEven do if we have a increasing tourists man I'm a ... a great expansion and the American sector\nOr because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down the coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to wonder why don't you think you've made up yeah I Know but it's it it sounds like it doesn't that sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got the Gulf of them a good answer on the\nWhole Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist total and my and that is why I I truly believe that ... and veterans fish now in the energy sector is really happening and they just happening\nNow they're concentrates at the moment I mean look at China that the speed of ... of it is a new installment of renewable energy it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well where the coal fired power plants absolutely\nBut my argument if you will see now that ... and then she will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum will suck which brings me to another point you mentioned China new wave role in energy security\nSay twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulled away a little bit from Russia\nGave does it does a good story about into beta in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian gas an older guys on board ducked terminal comes from the barn she comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there\nSo this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than old not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she could all key that no agent energies plane as some people might not have reason to buying it but it will say that it means that the way it's a counterweight to leave power that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or Iran or\nIn the parents said they have drilled about twice as much to Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the ... and see and I don't think it's necessarily get that in our back all the ... and love bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nThat that is according to the carbon project and if you see the Congress hasn't been originally seats to summer\nIt is a totally different picture coming up now so if the current price is high in Europe gas will exclude cold at least according to what you mean by that call them price the price you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy by\nAnd there's a market inside Europe and the president had been artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe to a low cost when those prices starting to rise then you guest will push out cold enough push health renewables\nFail and we'll just have to understand that renewable and gas are competing nobody in Germany they are afraid they'll be able to carve uprising now but also the way the energy and worked\nAnd seems to be able to manage it much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are\nThey are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\n... but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're going to keep exporting gas to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments but it does and it's about what kind of you do we have for Europe past twenty states and Europe is committed to have hero come get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector after twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way relatively poor country Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country

vote but Brett Kavanaugh looks to be headed to the U.S Supreme Court\nJudging from official announcement from a procedural vote yesterday Senate Republicans have secured the votes they need to confirm it at is expected just a mentor conservative majority on the court\nNPR's Ron Elving joined just run thanks so much for being with us good one he's five now we can both named conservative justices shooters Stevens black men Kennedy who issued who joined a liberal and progressive is on the court\nBut uh this confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh could have impact generations could\nOh yes we assumed the current line up to five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents to named Bush out to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members were alumni of the federalist society who it's been which has been a growing force in the court for years and a swelling presence on the federal bench that it's lower levels and with the Trump Administration and White House counsel Don McGahn or they have truly come into their own [noise]\nWhat do we need to know about the federalist society especially is they're going to be ...\nTeen eighties it was a pushback by students in Google's legal scholars are people who were convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy of a few justices with big ideas about social and political justice\nMembers of the society of indicated a desire to revisit some of the landmark decisions of the past two generations\nAsking the question of whether or not the basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody's interpretation of the constitution and let let's underscored there's nothing remotely secretive about this right\nNot a secret society at all and they've been quite public about their campaign and about their influence within the Republican Party\nAnd about their desire to revisit things like the privacy concept in roe versus Wade that legalized abortion or even the one person one vote concept that required state legislative districts to have equal population um if Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation\nIs the the the combination of decades of organizing um are Republicans energized get out to the polls about a month from now or do many feel\nMission accomplished there could be both a feeling of accomplishment and a feeling of opportunity to press further and some resentment over the confirmation process in some of the accusations that were raised in the way they were raised against Brett Kavanaugh\nBut midterms are more often driven by anger than satisfaction and right now polls show a lot of women and younger voters are unhappy with Kavanaugh and even many Republican women are unhappy with their party\nAnd that could also be a big factor in the midterms I'm now it's interesting to me you point to anger and that certainly reflected in in the surveys you mentioned unemployment is at a three point seven percent are historically low about a forty year low\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from

following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Megan McCarthy columnist for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views which we welcome and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported a pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian bussing Fort now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] um what's that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more\nAnd sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with as it doesn't look to possible\nThat they should confirm me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote you know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the stories of the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal and people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and then it had both of them had testified at length and you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative\nBy not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of the fact because she was in well so she had basically two pieces corporation for her story she had people she had told him sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen but should\nPeople basically there to because of cooperation were her therapist notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not like having a name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen foot\nWell let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's in she's on Christian bussing Ford a sincere a boat that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses wearing her support\nIt was true pointed out such the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time it is an inherently difficult crime because you know some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated\nTo consent you'd end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have necessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible on and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in that neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrent [noise]\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved\nFrom people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth [noise]\nUm it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it's it's way worse than what ... making the turtle thanks so much thank you [noise] to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents\nThe president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations is Tim O'Brien he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat's easily their head or of this one I don't think that to news though I think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal\nDollars or so in in wealth\n[noise] to keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked\nOn several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars it was transferred\nAnd instead they they paid around fifty million or so\nWhen when Donald ... over the years I've built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm President Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co sign of loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that\nThe times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale and his dependence on his father was really laid pretty barren that story so that's another important theme of the story which is\nThe president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you did you can recognizing that maybe people are going over the story now can recognize is distinctly illegal\n[noise] yeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used an appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests\nThat that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used\nTo inflate how much they were spending an equipment and supplies for their armada of buildings so they could then pockets a differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly frogs\nPenalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president the most about what I think\nReally will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks them this idea that he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps and he he earned his living on his own rather than being someone who was born on third base and said he hit a triple which was essentially the stories he's been putting out there for a long time\nTim O'Brien a Bloomberg opinion thanks so much like he's
