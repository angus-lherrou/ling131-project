behaves yet ... he's in a great position to tell us what information wolf that looks like in real life\nAnd he turns out there were a few telltale signs in the case of these men spreading video\nThis really really fits it is almost perfect example of the pattern\nThat you see these Russian trolls or or the Russians on social media take over and over and over again they're going to either create or take a piece of\nControversial material they're going to release it onto their\nState funded media social media platforms\nAnd then they're going to start talking about that piece of information and you'll see them\nJump onto like Youtube video and they will run commentary talking about in this case it would be anti social justice warriors and then they would also come in with the pros social justice warrior accounts\nSo the idea here is that if you divide countries over these controversial issues that will lead them to be weaker on the world stage\nThat's right let me put it in these times man's spreading may not be the most divisive issues but by staging such a strong radical protest against it and it'll be provoked very strong feminist an anti feminist responses\nAnd some of them would actually quite extreme just have a look at it on social media accounts and you'll find that\nRather aggressive common violent threats pornographic he mentions that cetera\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context in politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world is ...\nHow come I self had somebody who is a fairly uh engaged with the star wars universe on a daily basis\nThat's Dr molten bay she's a research fellow at the center for digital future at the University of Southern California but more importantly he's a big star wars fan\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is the imperial insignia one is the rebel insignia and then I have a early version of what are we in the west know as the union yang symbol that's basically sort of a way of showing a sort of an evil and good and balance\nWhen Star Wars the last jet I came out last year sometimes to key issue with the casting choices she never before I had a star wars film had so many women in ethnically diverse ... prominent roles in the Gulf some fans the evening\nAt the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent reading was molten got curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at director Ryan jumps and\nSome of them actually behavior that looked a lot like trolls what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I found a small number that looked a little bit like they might be for Russia there\nWere sixteen out of nine hundred and thirty seven which isn't a lot actually it it seems a little bit to me that that would be the norm to expect these days now that Russia's influence campaign has been\nAround for at least you know a number of years and the Russian trolls have been started themselves in American discourse on line for a number of years and all kinds of situations\nAt the states you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about as tall walls failed isn't that a bit farfetched\nA daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying three weeks before an election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kind of have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level\nWhether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's something else that doesn't really matter and you know it's it's kind of a divide and conquer tactic that's the kind of idea just a generally destabilized\nLet's stick to digest that it's not that divisions haven't always existed in society to take the star was example whatever people's thoughts would about the coughing choices than would always be some people who would agree and something who disagree\nBut if ... All right what is happening here is that Russian operatives infiltrating the spaces and setting up the volume magic what if those disagreements and of course a fractured society as a society that struggles to take action\nAs the other says anger leads to hate hate leads to the dark side and I think that there's a lot of anger out there right now this is a tactic as old as war fanning the flames of anger and the populace as a very very easy way to start uprisings\nBut Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nWell from a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already liquid skepticism at a western feminism\nThen what do you does is to reinforce the views that the majority view that can often be found on Russian state media and the context of conversations about the me too movement and so won the confidence is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it\nOkay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level\nFrom the moments to vie do get picked up by media around the world and uh because of the ways so provocative it's only bound to increase the divisions in societies that all well already divided if you are sympathetic to on this point uh you know there was if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repelled\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that are rabid conservative writers are spinning out of control on the other hand if you already have an anti feminist bias\nThen divvied you will only can some days in the strongest possible terms you'll very likely to see it as an example of this senseless political correctness brigade in action [noise]\nGo back to the question that we raised at the beginning of the program Ken we conclusively say ... video on demand spreading wasn't active staged Kremlin propaganda campaign against this information suggests if you're looking for a smoking gun here then we don't have one but what we can say\nOne very similar to people studying the way Russia drives you to be seen the ... campaigns\nBut at the end of the day does that really matter does it matter to know whether or not and the video which raises a valid point I suppose is an active propaganda\nWell I'm going to let John Walsh the Russian troll hunter we spoke to earlier on um sometimes\nMy real in goal here is to get people to be a little more conscious about\nWhat they decide to share on line and get people to maybe understand the sharing this piece of what looks to be\nOn verified information or this viral retreating is very by rote tweet that confirms your political bias might not always be the greatest thing and to just take like a couple of minutes and look at what you're getting ready to do before you do it\nSo as we said before think twice before you share retreat [noise]\n\nMonkeys silver

S. gathered such momentum\nBut we have three waves of it so initially it starts due to poor regulation of pharmaceutical companies could make opioids which led to\nQuite dribbling of prescribing in the United states from the mid nineties for about Fifteen Years and that brought us to level like about six times per capita what you would see in Great Britain for example\nThe bad guys many people addicted to prescription opioids and then came the second wave was that heroin traffickers are reasons correctly that if they opened up shop in a lot of American towns where they had previously not had a presence\nThere would be able to convert a lot of people from opioid pills to heroin and they were right and so then that started our second phase and then most recently in the last five years or so has been the infiltration of the heroin supply with fentanyl which is a synthetic opioid far more potent than heroin and that has\nTurned a disaster into a catastrophe you know upper scale we haven't seen in drug policy and in several generations\nMe what is ... and why it has become so popular among uses\nYou know is entirely synthetic opioid that means that does not drive from the opium poppy you can make it in a lab you could make it in your sink therefore many people can produce it and at the moment the main producers are in China\nAnd with the Internet they been able to get markets where they sell directly to Americans and sometimes deliver a it here in our postal service\nAnd the other thing they've done in the status links with Mexico where they deliver federal benefits blended into the heroin which is very appealing to heroin track or because they have a drug you can make just as strong at at a much lower price than heroin cost and then that and then in Port in the U.S over the U.S Mexico border\nSo serious is the problem now in the United states the Democrats and Republicans have come together to back this legislation in an attempt to a ... ... says one of the main ended up and self that legislation\nSo probably the first thing to note is it what is not there which is there's not an enormous amount of money the parties were far apart on that issue nonetheless they did find a lot of sensible policies that weren't expensive but are should be helpful things like\nA reimbursing the training of people who specialize in addiction having our Medicare program which is our program for senior citizens\nCover opioid addiction treatment which had not done up to that point of supporting efforts to use a different insurance program called Medicaid for people who are in jails and prisons because they're extremely high risk of overdose and so\nThere's going to be demonstration projects where there'll be able to get access to health care before they leave prison and hopefully that will preserve their lives but there are many things like that that together I think will lead up to setting some lives even though this was not a\nTransformative piece of legislation\nSo how we get a message to the success of this legislation would it be the reduction in the number of deaths from drug overdoses\nThat would certainly be a very good outcome although it's you know only one of multiple outcome that ad or being addicted to opioids is very hard and people's health and also just they're functioning in daily life and their ability to hold a job or succeed in school or just play an active part in their families so also be measuring\nThe prevalence of addiction in the country and then we're going to major the prevalence of new addiction in other words if we're providing health care properly it's not just a matter of people were already addicted\nWe should stop creating as many addicted people as we have in prior years\nBut ... is a drug policy expert at Stanford University and then not to say there's a what ways uh\nCrisis in the United states which has not been signed into law by President Trump [noise]\n\nYou're listening to weld updates coming from the BBC in London I'm Julian Marshall and a headline says Arab French court has ruled that the former president Nicolas Sarkozy\nShould be tried for alleged and to get rid get averages in his twenty twelve reelection campaign Japan's prime minister has arrived in China such visit in seven years President Trump has called for politicians and the U.S media to be most typical off to pipe bombs was sent\nTo a number of his political opponents\nAnd now to ... ... over it is this year more than twenty women to be a victims of what is now and it's kind of side\nA domestic violence was made illegal in two thousand and two and a new law was protein most you had to reinforce existing legislation but just to students on just strain has Nicholas Kelly reports from the Serbian capital Belgrade [noise]\nAt ten hours GMT this is the newsroom from the b._b._c.

he had done\nIt at the time people were thinking about\nThe real Nicholas Barclay they just weren't thinking about it\nHad a theory about why it happened to the real Nicholas by plane but he hadn't I preach and he couldn't get the evidence to back it up but it was a real puzzle here why did the bullies family taken someone who is clearly an impulse to even if it's an experienced one Chinese ... they had something to hide\nThat started checking out the real Nicholas Barclay and I went door to door in the neighborhood and I found out that the the the boy the real Nicholas Barclay was one tough

Jason was living in a halfway house\nRight I guess he was an addict\nYes I Believe the FBI interviewed him in a in our pressured him and pressured him to talk\nAbout the FBI and Charlie became convinced that Jason had something to do with his brother's disappearance or the very least knew something about it but they go to Jason wasn't charged with any\nNo Jason was in charge but something
