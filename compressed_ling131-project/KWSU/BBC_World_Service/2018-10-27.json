know I think it's a good thing when it is\nChoices but their choices cannot uh include for example the depriving of minorities or you know unlike individuals of their uh equal rights than a liberal society so that's really I think the issue in front of us\nWhat linked D.C between demanding dignity and identity politics\nWell I think that the basis of modern identity politics is this feeling that we all have\nThat we have this inner source of dignity that's not being adequately recognized and that's why we go into politics because we want political recognition that\nA dignity we want to society to acknowledge that we are the group that we belong to the religion of the nation the gender or ethnicity the race that people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that propelled a lot of\nPolitics in the world over the last couple of hundred years you recently got a voice mail from a supporter of Donald Trump didn't you know so did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are\nAh she said yes it does it says that it's the people that fought in the American revolution and their descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us\nI suspect that she doesn't literally mean\nThe descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect it's something like you know we white Europeans are the real hundreds of this country and people that aren't that way are somehow in not part of the national community and by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I you know [laughter]\nI was born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this is really an option for me\nNow that will be people all over the world and not just support is a populist leaders like victim oil banning hungry who you mentioned in your book and like the alternatives to Germany movement that you will send mentioned that will be loads of people who who who listen to you and think\nWhat Californians view you know what a liberal Californian view your day Nate has passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies rules and got all the money you know it's all of a tough how'd you react to that\nYou know I I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live in a de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where the ...\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to have a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of\nBeing open to people or you know that are different nationalities cultures of religions and integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions are collectively\n... and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened I think by these people that are you say her you know not Californian let that are rooted in one particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIf a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in November in in the U.S\nVote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans surely that democracy if black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it\nIt is to Fox or see an action or and I don't I think that what it's going to threaten is not democracy per se is going to threaten liberal democracy\nOr because I think that Donald Trump has been trying to avoid accountability by basically attacking any institution

some ways a merchandise democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes but I've lived in middle ground it doesn't feel as if we've got anything stable to stand on\nSo I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom but also wanting to be able to ensure that we've got a quality I are always going to\nIdentity politics it's really saw shifting sons in

James Robin first with Russia breached the treaty\nIt's very clear that the United states and I live in a way to think about being serious violations of the treaty by Russia but equally the Russians think aspects of the United states military posture in Europe and the deployment of missiles in Europe\nHas in effect to undermine the treaty or otherwise so there's a balance of accusation if you like but I think this is much more about renewables armed with or the world should worry whenever I read was dismantled more than anything else\nChinese intermediate range missiles development is arguably the biggest threat to the U.S [noise] but I Do think America kennel will do anything to try to negotiate\nIs that the constraint is on there as a result the IMF treaty because after all it can't break out some come from China with the sort of missiles it thinks it should in response to aspects of Chinese medicine physician it's clear the United states\nThinks that that is a future threat potentially actually a far greater threat and the threat posed by Russia Russia after all is sitting on a declining economy\nTalks the talk and there's obviously still a substantial military

example of the evidence the BBC has been shining a spotlight on this week the face of the of the week people in western China or the emergence of all look like mass prison camps for all of the re education centers\nIf an authoritarian China\nWere to fall back into a militaristic nationalism particularly if it felt pressure at home\nOr political and economic if Chinese growth continues to stall as it has done\nThen perhaps it could emerge as the biggest single strategic challenge and the United states doesn't want to feel this in any way constrain perhaps actually from beginning an arms race with China which is then ended or at least reduced in scale under threat\nBy separate vacations with the Chinese but the United states wants to be strong position to confront China and it feels that way the limited treaty the IMF treaty dealing only bilaterally with Russia that it is constrained\nIn life as a result of this is Russia playing or are there any advantages to what America is doing\nI think it's very simplistic does look to me that uh we might be less safe off curl scrapping the IMF treaty does feel like\nIt doesn't it scrapping at least one speed limits on that particularly

announced it was going to be a short sharp campaign to restore the internationally recognized government of president ...\nWell that's turned out to be anything but true by one estimate there have been airstrikes carried out by the Saudi led coalition in Yemen every Ninety minutes since then on the impact has been absolutely devastating in terms of the loss of civilian life in terms of the damage to infrastructure\nBut also I Would say in terms of the grave damage to Saudi Arabia's international reputation\nOn the longer the conflict has gone on to more instances of being identified by

orchestrate his ability to stay on the throne um he has a de facto leader in Saudi Arabia because his father is age to nailing the second scenario is that he is replaces crown prince\nAnd there is precedent for that over the last three years to other crown princes have been pushed aside in part to make room for him there's a third option or that his powers a weekend that the king of points others in the royal family did\nTo assume some of the roles that uh MVSA has managed to accumulate in his office over the last a year and a half and the fourth is that there is a kind of physical

see and it was shortly after he'd be allowed to travel to the U.S or you were just according to reports who's arrived there is it possible someone told him posed with the prince and you can get out and you're\nAbsolutely uh there's no question the royal family had banned him from traveling since his father had left the kingdom to go into exile and there had to be a lot of behind the scene maneuvering including a request specifically by the United\nStates and secretary of state Pompeo to allow him to leave the country and join his brothers in the United states three of a ... sons are

a criminal complaint which described efforts by the Russian backed Internet research agency to use Twitter budge\nTo influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including issues raised in sports Andrew beaten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy\nOver players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem street and joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on why was this Internet research agency interested in whether football players took her new you're not during the plane of the anthems well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord this\nIssue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issue\nJust people that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that reached the top of\nThe food chain what did you find when you were dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency\nWell what we found was these tweets had gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then to Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the party from tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University\nWho helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation\nSo it it it wasn't direct the chief being a certain result just to to stir things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught contentious issue\nAnd also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rapid fans to try to track to this debate [noise]\nAh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed direct\nYeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with the is it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up\nAnd one of the interesting notes that the clubs and professors had was that these are closed but they are monitor new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations and they're continuing to weigh in on controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw [noise]\nType of things where they would continue to weigh in Andrew beaten up the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for

take NPR seriously enough with all your frugality and hide jinx so we decided that we needed to finally try to require a reputation for sober consideration at this network and I'm Glad to have done it\nThanks so much I'm curious question yes um they're serious chilling events a school shooting range church bombings in this week oh thankfully no one's harm bomb threats so much harder than others to have fun with the news\nOh yes but we know that we have a particular role handling all that stuff that's your job and\nWe know that what our audience wants is for us to make them feel a little better and if that takes a ignoring the bad stuff in focusing on the goofy them will do that if there is something\nGoofy about the bad stuff will highlight that\nAll I can say is the worst of the news and sometimes it's been very bad\nThe more we feel an obligation to step up to the plate and really bring the silly you've had so many um famous gas including of course of a president of United States to two presidents of the yeah we had ... before he became president but I'm taking credit for it because he hasn't spoken to be sense [laughter]\nAnd the second president the second president was Bill Clinton who appear to host president say that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job and the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions they're inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case that for example and we can show\nThey'll think what they think about John Case but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human being I Love bill Curtis yeah um how could you not and I miss Carl Kasell we all you've had some great partners I have and I've been blessed and I have stood on the shoulders are next to the
