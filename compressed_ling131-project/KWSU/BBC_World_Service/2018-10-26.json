corruption as well as the insurgency undermined the authority of the state\nWell my gosh this President Ghani has recently appointed national security advisor having to do a lot more easy formally Afghanistan's ambassador in the U.S a technocrat with little previous security experience is the Afghan government really in a position to shape the future of the country\nWell I'm dilemma he joins me now on the line from Kabul welcome to talk of Pakistan to be here we speak of course after the parliamentary elections would you a shame that the\nWay those elections works out with so many Afghans are facing the possibility of going to the polls ... cause\nPrimaries ever thing that is currently wrong with Afghanistan and its politics\nThere were multiple threats by the Taliban are and they're it's precedence attacks on polling stations the Afghan people defied all of that in came out to vote I think that speaks for itself on what the African people's verdict on democracy is and what it is that they want in their life\nThis was the first election that was completely organized by the Afghan government and security provided by the ...\nUh I think they did a tremendous being a good job compared to what we had in the past\nUm even from the number of attacks that that ... that were um launched on on the election day in two thousand fourteen when we had foreign security assistance and the elections or had a lot of support from the international community ah we're much larger scale than we had this here\nLet's look at reality I I Do not mean to belittle the bravery of those three or ... million Afghans who didn't go to the polls in face of Taliban threats I Do not political that bravery for one second but here's the reality of your own electoral commission and\nSay that at least a quarter of polling stations across the country didn't open because of security concerns we know the whole swaths of territory including Kandahar\nAnd the guy's name a that was no voting because of security concerns of course they may be some more voting next week we're not quite sure will we know that your own a transparent election foundation and the country found that the biometric systems were not working and many of the polling stations which were open\nAnd if one takes all of that the guy that plus the dozens killed and more than a hundred wounded around polling stations one has to conclude\nThat off the Seventeen years off post Taliban governance the government than Afghanistan is still not delivering for its people\nWell the government of Afghanistan is delivering for its people and that's for where we didn't have elections for insecurities of course we took risks\nI issued a statement to our people\nOur security forces that what I Would be doing is to reflect their voices\nIn our policies it's true we haven't been able to deliver the kind of services that our soldiers in on the front line deserve they have not failed us but I Want to make sure that we also do not failed and when it comes to policies and get out of the genes that that protect their lives and their families\nYou know what I'm mine ... mine hold of something that Hamid Karzai's former president said as he was leaving office it was something that deeply upset and many people\nAre in the west in NATO particularly family members of those who lost their lives 'cause he said this she said the nighttime exercise all of its operations in Afghanistan have been ones that have caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering and loss of life I Know\nAnd of course the operations costs more than two thousand American lives more than four hundred and forty British lives one could almost say the same thing today to Afghan veterans the families of those who lost their lives in uniform serving the Afghan government all of this loss of life\nEither from nighttime forces off from your own Afghan forces unfold watch because this is the more you can't win\nThat's again um something that you have the luxury to say as Africans we don't\nBecause our country if it does not winnable we have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives and protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on a on colleagues from previous government\nUm they have their own opinion what I can say to you or is this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show\nIs to tell you and and your viewers that this is not the Afghanistan that you only see it from TV there is so much more to that context I understand that there is only so much news a space for a lot of fun and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate\nBut this is a transform country whether you look at it\nPhysically or you look at it socially I'm a generation Seventy five percent of this country\nAh grew up in the war at our aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nOr to help us along that way and know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste yes we are at war it's not an eighth it's not a water that we have brought upon ourselves it's a war that we must end\nA and it takes a it it it takes more now than just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures everyday and thanks to reason with support who are being helping\nAnd equipment and training or security or actors or to provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe we don't have so much time with somebody so let me ask you some quick questions a pivoting toward you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular the United states and of course\nThis Donald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand on them\nBut he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as quickly as possible one thing moved to America is privatizing\nThe U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently so Eric Prince formally that had the Blackwater who wants to get a piece about action how would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military a privatized contract to force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we should a statement this in we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our our life we're fighting terrorism and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now it turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's Afghan\nAnd why is all my ...\nHe had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know that those talks were taking place at the time were you told beforehand\nWe knew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about that people confused talks with negotiations\nThe Afghan government has the initiative on the peace and reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire wet\nI'm going to tell you when you're gone yeah 'cause we'd have to you know you're young and I don't think it was a stray down said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reported sources saying quote fills that\nHad these meetings with ah the officials from the Taliban just uh he flew to the Gulf states have coffee talk he quietly ... them and Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government heard of that meeting only afterwards true news\nFor or or what is going on it's a lot more detailed than what you see in a news report adjust because few words were not said in a meeting doesn't mean that was intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ambassador obviously you're not with me very exhausted from his trip\nYou didn't want to be clear then I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the Taliban\nAnd it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided that far from this position in the past when the Afghan government always says we must own\nAny political process with the Taliban now the Americans seemed to be saying\nNo we're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nNo you you cannot have one incident\nUh dictate an entire policy\nOr that's not what the Americans are saying and that's not what the American stands as we are are in ... I mean in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process of guns do own and drive the peace process\nAnd that's the only way for success it's not that we we won the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan\nAnd it would be a shame that all your investment in our in mass investment in sacrifices go to waste\nI'm are asked by a ... it through a process where I don't that process and it's very clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take Mr national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's\nRight to stake in the governance of your country what would it take will\nWill the Taliban contend elections there more than welcome to participate and see that the Afghan people want that process despite their threats\nThey participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place in Afghan society other than driving fear into them then they must come and content and the wet weather the Afghan people really vote for them or not they they can only a B\nAnd and the Afghan people accept can only be known

away The Waltons on the agenda beforehand so it's interesting that union is feeding the practice it will strengthen northern Ireland's union with Britain\nWhereas people who would never have been talking about the idea of Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland becoming one that they're not talking about that as a serious consideration and some people who would actually of identified as one of the British union aside if things are now starting to soften up to the idea so it's a very interesting set of circumstances\nAnd certainly it's something that's being discussed on a daily basis you know every radio show every TV show every talk show every polling older by these questions Milwaukee one for the future of Northern Ireland you know how do you feel it but the idea of Irish

only describe it as a fee broil divided conservative policy\nBut I think what doesn't change is the big picture which really does ... rather grim and challenging for her and that is\nHow long enough to she got a deal about Britain's withdrawal and future relationship with Europe that somehow satisfies yes that fee brawl divided conservative policy which doesn't want any businesses in the u._k. too much which doesn't put up ... and and and that was enough which satisfies the e twenty seven\nSyrup you've laid out a complex set of conditions that need to be felt that all the different policies that needs to be satisfied but I understand the parameters of that's a fairly clear up because Europe has kind of pretty much light down you know what it needs to see that\nYou're absolutely right and I think in many ways that's why we are in the horrible fix that that we are in that if you like there's a contradiction in the practice of projects among the EU as prepared to offer I mean if we're really going to strip it back to basics Justin and if you\nIf you think about it what what was what was labeled up outside was taking back and I quote control of a bold us all ... ... ... a well it's quite tricky to figure out how you do that\nAnd have friction less trade with the European Union and not have a cold or in Northern Ireland unless of course the European Union was to say guess what you can actually have spoke to you kinda have something special we will recognize British rules and regulations\nAs in hot equivalent ... and that is why we are in the fix that we're in the basically Britain has been saying we'd like everything that we used to like about a thing about Mrs you none of the things that we didn't like and the eight was saying was she got to be kidding\nSo what we're seeing is the ... middle of a negotiation but how much did they brinkmanship how much and that is both sides kind of holding out for the past failed I can possibly get how much compromise can you do you think it's possible within their positions of the two costs me ...\nI think some of it as brinkmanship a dozen things that you felt like compromising by much cause at things flying on a minute you know the people who voted to leave it you'll mess you clear it up and clearly Theresa May hasn't got very much room for compromise given those are much mentioned divisions\nWe'll be maybe they'll scrape together a deal but one that\nPuts off all those issues that we've been talking about just the next actually will the future relationship\nBe won't will happen with trade what will happen precisely about the ball just so they sort of settle on making sure that there is in chaos next march march of next year when Britain leaves the European Union but all those issues who's going to compromise how is the future relationship kind of what\nThat that'll get sort of kicked tends not transition period between next march and the end of twenty twenty\nBullets and if they can't agree again if they're struggling to agree just on the divorce agreement just on this withdrawal agreement\nThen how is it that that will come to a final settlement they'll come to the the we get enough compromise between the two parties to come to a settlement that there'll be able to actually find some kind of a deal for ...\nIt's a fantastic question and of course it's it's one in a way when when you are good at Fort drives breakfast ... people really enthusiastic about ... crazy they thing hang on a minute this these talks transition could go on forever and ever\nBut it also all those people who would have preferred to remain in the European Union who think this is just looks like a recipe for kind of chaos and disaster Britain's sold in the European Union but so some notes in it so now the prospects of a long long process pleases neither remain as an all leave us\nOkay let's just go back to the issue that is probably comes about the Irish border that's struggling to a great for the withdrawal agreement that that's the false agreement how are they going to come to a sacrament in the in the longest I bought my assessment of the border look like who's likely to compromise\nIs an immensely difficult question just and of course some really smart people have been looking at for two years and of course\nYou know the the reason there's nowhere in the world whether it's notable the two countries and the customs union or in a way that you and the u._k. trying to do the impossible I suspect\nThe compromise and the show someone will only be able to show some obey the whole of the
