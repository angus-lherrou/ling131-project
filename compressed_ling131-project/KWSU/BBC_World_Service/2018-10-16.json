psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud but Katrina first let's getting like deer from you about Vienna at the city and it's people who\nAre doing Hungary at the turn of the nineteenth century was modernizing very fast growing up in a short period I think the changing uh especially in Indiana\nThat city grew enormously but also new ways of transportation I implement that like the ... train even cars\nAnd ... came into the House's new ways of communication and maybe in sharp contrast to debt that institution granted social structures did not at that that quickly\nI'm In a sense it was still quite the pre modern empire holding together many nations that belt ready crackling to get into a nation state of their own between the trend of the time\nThe real truth of those that can be invented\nControversial pronouncements made by politicians the truth is not reading truth comes to mind that [noise]\nAnd one can only imagine what he just sort of social media have the Internet today but cross was very focused not just on particular issues and misused of facts but also on sloppy language now tell me why was this seven\nUm I think that it's important to say that there's a caricature of cross as a kind of linguistic purists someone who only thought models of language and figures like Shakespeare curtain Schiller or many of whom make all sorts of appearances and crosses writing for early on\nAnd someone who believe that everything that's been produced since then it's just pure swell and I think that I'm the same age as the misrepresentation I think that would misunderstand cross from the views on language\nI'm In its relationship to what we might call something like ethical life\nOr to put it simply cross saw language as deeply embedded are intertwined with the moral character of its producer of its writer so if one wrote ... and I think a writing properly and cross his mind can be many things that could mean\nNot including a combat due to editorial oversight or to reproducing cliches for the purpose of digest stability or to imposing abstract rules on language rather than letting kind of language and sought coke constitute their co form one another\nBits for cross was all an indication that there was something deeply arise in the morality of the author or more likely\nA one could say of the morality of the society in which such language could be received and produced so an critically\nUm and I think just as a small anecdote to illustrate when I'm Talking about one of cross has more humorous piece or set of pieces is what he calls a kind of translation and quotes of one of his journalistic contemporaries man by the name of Maximilian heart and\nCross calls this piece Esperanto a it's a reference of course also to the invented language Esperanto\nThe peace or the several pieces consist of multiple pages of hardens excessively floored pros juxtapose then against cross his so called translation of these phrases into more accessible direct language\nAnd cross does this I take it that what he's doing is he's exposing some of the ideological underpinnings that are in heart in language but that his language actually obscures and so this is kind of one example of how cross seeks to relate\nSloppy language to either hidden duplicitous ... or moral failure or on a grander scale political catastrophe\nSit by sloppy language he doesn't just mean literally bad grammar wherever he's talking about old maps and they have yeah and he's a skull was awfully religions to classic works is Jim and Jim and Shakespeare as you said and he was a continued the brilliant tradition of German language aphorism which is ... ... feet often surprised an infant expressions of a truce\nAbout Nineteen oh six and late to publish them in book for several times but he himself was aware of the limitations\nAn aphorism never coincides with the true it is either a ... year old woman to half truths\nThat Vienna also had a prestigious fits that tradition something that I think was particularly important to crash in fact throughout his life he gave hundreds of one man shows tell me Katrina why was say it's so important to him\nWhen I think at cause had a million even in relationship to the U.S yet that he wanted to become an actor at first\nThat didn't work out and and he very much disliked modern development for instance I'm the director max Reinhardt who very famous said cross this time in Germany especially um he developed a day on a mental Shelley um production\nAnd contrary to cross the kind of embrace that he actually 'cause blender\nBut what crowd imagined or was it ... set the stage for this book and good and not to edit pieces to shorten them and and make room for for the stage but to really stay with the drama\nItself and that seems\nSo the picture on getting of crass than is before the first war is with someone who is surrounded by lots of colleagues Senate wants his\nFriends and someone but at the same time he's a bit of an outsider which which is probably had a choice and the other's circumstance I mean this is fascinating psychologically I mean I read that he feels like a double outside in Vienna because he was born\nIn a small town in what is now the Czech Republic and ... and be fool and also because he was Jewish\nI think ah to kind of reiterate one of the month points he he despise the idea of being associated with any particular group or be that ethnic religious political um I think that he saw dangers and completely uh you know absorbing oneself and those collective identities\nAnd I think he was especially opposed to the idea of being associated with a group simply because one was born into it simply because Kraus was born into a\nSmall bohemian town or because he was born Jewish and I think that's partially explains also crossers lifelong I Would say fairly deeply ambivalent attitude toward his own relationship maybe better set the tone\nJewish identity um but just to give another camp across as thoroughly booth law but\nSo what the working class or in sometimes never with the class to which he I'm officially belonging American as one example of saying across as an outsider status at work\nFor all his public pronouncements cross was cornered private mine and kept his personal life to himself but we do know that there's great love was through the ... not hung up about ... I'm patron of the ... based in a small shot so about a hundred miles south of crossers birthplace in what is now the Czech Republic\nI'm the only country in the ... with the relationship like\n... first and foremost it had to be a secret relationship um they met in Nineteen Thirteen one yeah before the war and as he didn't he now Daniel CD as he called her she inspired cross to write poetry\nAnd he also wrote 'em over a thousand letters to her during the course of the relationship the relationship last it with interruptions until it fast [noise]\nAnd maybe it's especially noteworthy that crowd he had his hands full with a his work you just mentioned that a nine hundred and twenty two issues of to fuck it but didn't he didn't mean that Danny's case uh he really sat down and wrote like every other day very long letter\nHer lettuce to him my last um we don't have them\nBut do we know from his letters that he shows have very different kind of personality and in that means really in love you I think he would have wanted to marry her she would not she wanted to marry properly another aristocrat\nBut she's still kept having a relationship with crowd continued to meet him to travel to gather and you can really call her one of the most important um women is live although ... quite a few so that he had this lonely images and through yet actually quite a full of life I think\nAnd incidentally has oh she provided a quiet place to rest and worked for him and she may have inspired some ground says best a lyric perjury here in the end of a poem cooled to wrinkle\nIn you tend to do well remembered line preying on salt to rest muscle so that this final trays of godly grace may remain\nEven the crowd was usually suspicious of new technology is an interesting fact is that he did by a calm fairly early on in Nineteen fourteen and\nLicense in Austria Hungary but the carefree days of measuring across Europe was soon ... by the outbreak of the first World War and how crowds react to the war is the subject for the second answer this forum for maybe she will say this will be back in a couple of them [noise]\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

drunk yeah\nYeah well I think I'm going to go back to something Katrina had early across had been effectively against the war from from very very early on and more so than probably Ninety five percent of his contemporaries but his position toward the monarchy had actually changed quite drastically over the course of the war [noise]\nFrom what we could call earlier support of the institution to becoming actually arguably it's most ardent critic\nUm I Would actually argue that cross as the war was dragging on especially did not only really anticipate the outcome of it was but that eventually he really desire to it because he knew that it would bring this sort of decadent aging and when he saw as wholly immoral institution to ruin\nThat is the very institution that actually impose the war on its subjects from the first place\nAnd the first few years of the post war period he became what the scholar Edward Tim's has called a quote reluctant Democrat that is to say that cross was always a bit hesitant to fully endorsed the political changes that were transpiring\nWhat concerned cross initially was the economic misery after the war that led so many to become actually misspell jak\nFor something like the good old days are kind of you know make Austria great again even though as cross repeatedly said in various different ways that it was the monarchy that's ultimately responsible for bringing the war\nMeant um attack trying to connect the dots I'm Better than they were actually being connected by many of of all students citizens\nSo I guess that's the thing that cross embrace democracy and even for a while the Social Democrats although that relationship became more tenuous as the twenties went on\nA but he kept an eye are very keen eye on the reactionary elements of society as they were developing even from early in the Nineteen twenties so specifically the clerical side of Austria\nBut also so called fringe parties on the right for example even the one that hit the represented and actually it's very interesting that I Believe in the early Nineteen\nTwenty three is not earlier cross was already paying attention to the swastika and already knew who Hitler was

resulted from the ... of European booted off the wall\nCrass continue to expose what he saw as greed correctness and and the stupidity of his fellow citizens but he did keep an eye on the developments

and also conveniently forgetting all kind of miss defying all the horror and atrocities the suffering that happened in that place\nAnd all that I'm kind of as a tourist packages for money [noise]
