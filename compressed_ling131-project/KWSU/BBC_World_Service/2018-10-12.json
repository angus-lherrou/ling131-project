Institute of climate change at the London School of economics Julius ... he's an associate professor of an ecological economics at Leeds University\nI'm Molly Scott ... a member of the European Parliament\nFor the u._k. green policy\nThank you all for joining us before we begin I Want to introduce one more pests than I'm not Yuri ... he's one of the ...\nFor the wild aimed to keep rising label temperature to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to comment at price is the world on track to me anything like that target festival\nWent to clarify that the report doesn't call for anything the report also is a question that the government has asked the IPC\nIn two thousand Fifteen in the Paris Agreement on it was clear that two degrees of global warming was not a safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit the woman to one point five and now this report\nClearly shows that there is a important difference between warming if one point five and two degree and also shows demeaned in two ways in which global warming can be limited to that level\nAnd say just to be clear is dwelled on track to do anything like that\nThere to report is also very clear to ... it's not on track currently the pledges of the country that they submitted under the Paris Agreement lead lead to increasing emissions overtime and two twenty thirty whereabouts in mission should be decreasing very very deeply by twenty thirty\nPaint a picture of ... the consequences if temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five and two degrees for a few critical systems of Europe it is really important for\nExample for coral reefs at two degrees of warming we don't see any scientific evidence that they will ever survive at one point five degrees of warming it is still possible that some of them survive also for four to ... ecosystems there is a redo your shift and the impact\nOn forests and other systems and finally the also for humans the difference between one point five and to a degree of warming is about more than four hundred million people that are more affected by heat waves\nSaid already than doc consequences coming out that a roadmap power nasty you try and make the changes that are needed to bring temperature down what sort of thing that the report suggests might be necessary\nSaw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nSay that to people especially at the place fall we just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable live how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible a signing on American my nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important to people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards in my life has deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker\nA more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly because you don't have all the hanging around at the airport which\nEach with other alternatives I think it's a difference the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better quality large they don't spend as much time sitting and congestion worrying about pollution we can design a will there's birds lowering our missions and one in which people living standards Ohio\nLewis is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jokes that since the end\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to stay nobody anywhere is going to be losing from\nFrom switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and five to ... some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term clause doesn't equate long term I'm coffee I'll give you some examples we know that the increase of seeing an extra the the ...\nThing that you can get another country and in other countries have hurt the most a low income people for a larger share of their income you're going into energy so we cannot say that there are no\nLew says what we can face that these losers from this transition could be compensated to there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate for these short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of government to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other is simple we also now that the\nFossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training and we\nAre emerging from these other high technology sectors down we're thinking maybe the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get the short term\n... case if I can just bring you back for them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between a one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDC isn't them into politics and that to help people light you sell it because it in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice\nUm when I looked to sort of questions some of the assumptions sort of behind that point on some of the discussion earlier round you know is it too late to get those I mean we really already started on the terms of ...\nWe don't yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to live I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effectively\nAs greens working on European policy so you know should jump like with the sustainable finance area we can say the\nOil financial products or pension products has to be aligned with one point five perished target for example I can argue that and I and the parliaments and not gain support for that was previously I didn't and I think the reason politicians are on hold for they say look ahead and they mentioned the world's climate change the climate is breaking down\nAnd they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes now\nYou know it just went to us through this that's when I came to question who's going to pay for this one we should not see this as a luxury something that we do now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory wants\nTo just reading an investment in a safer and sustainable growth and went off from the question was going to pay for it for discipline station today one should also balanced is with the question what was going to pay for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already we can observe them today\nThey're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree are forming\nAnd read to degree you're forming this is not in the far future this is a one point five at the current levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so did this really not that far into the future so we really need to think about are we going to pay for that\nDown the road and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and and the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to be carefully managing managed so that they she the poor of the impacts of this or that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare law where he wants to come back and\nYeah and I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot happier than we have a nine to nine countries we've been able to see the entire Seventy three\nCountries with auctions fifty eight countries that are that have other places to stop the rainy a both and thanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mediation coming down significantly so he does making it easier there isn't\nA global carbon price for instance for the great\nThat is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient solution I kind of economically speaking however I what\n... is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level policies are subsidizing that renewable energy technologies which have traditionally been\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that an increasing number of applications and countries and the patient they're beginning to be competitive so it's these investments ... it is changing and that's what he said again we are doing and we have\nBeen doing it it's not enough I may I say the report is reminding us okay um but I Do think this point and he's made all saying they report about\nMaking sure that the most vulnerable or not heard is not just necessary for ethical reasons but it's also necessary for political reasons because only in that situation do you get the support you need\nBoth yeah so when we talk about coffee at some point we remember that the global economy is not stuffing and there are three big\nTrends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty cents to him down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to double\nNinety truly and we'll be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we make the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the\nGlobal economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is like it's a double in the next forty years they all trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our\nCurrent growth model which was delivering US cities that ... that polluted unpleasant places to be not productive\nFor we design our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing a to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that so I Want to wrap up this how fast now thank you to our panel throughout the as an adult ... case had\nA ... year we were a gal was taking a short break ... just to remind you let us know what you think of the program or any ideas of topics he like us to look into you can email

uncomfortable and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administrations do that actually except the science\nThat's hit from Myron evil he works for think tank called the contested Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the line from transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make Mondays I PCC reports\nI've investigated the claims and I find them want things from multiple viewpoint wanted them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effect on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but I mean\nLike I said I've been instructed to serve the can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that with the way the administration that it needs to take this seriously [noise]\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are a pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC as David said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea time back with us effective leadership is is not lost\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states and just happened not to be in the office and the president\nI'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and they've used the science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think fat efficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for weaker\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science what they do have a view as they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um\nSo the proof the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not discern that it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how that how do you decide gate and of course that trait howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of lead to shed the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives his reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it simply cheaper to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut isn't the point the facts are becoming separated from the optics and this is a president who wants to project divide the ticket or and this one that appeals to his electoral base and what she said oh with the kinds of conversation that we've been hunting here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including coal mining industries and we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but they are the other thing is I I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on called\nThe storm surge associated with fat is pick up because of the sea level rise and there's a good chance for the warmer than average Waltons and the goals well partly because of climate change I think people would say it's an increasing costs the bearing the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few area of the Trump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the U.S has been gone with this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump\nAt two years the narrow try to cut by ... percent I think the present some programs right to see her all at the route investment\nThat three thousand a year\nLet's go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are actually something that brings bipartisan support\nWas told to last about the first world the very developed well let's turn if we may\n... to ... the world that a growing I won't speak to treat the good he's a professor of environment and developing in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joined us today from Cairo joy I won't talk about India because if you're in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing\nSoft but also a country that has taken its climate change commitments fairly seriously just described with some of the changes that are underway\nWell India it's trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies be already knew that renewable energy could have a future but then if\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have bought right now there is much more energy efficient see on the agenda is much more to talk about\nRenewables but at the same time they just give you a small example in the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses were as in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north have to find a shortcut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to stay over here is that I have been studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have a huge savings in health\nAnd so that it's no good reason for taking action on a ... and they'll come back\nTo the politics because then the cost engine governments have argued that a country that's growing is simply not polices it wasn't part of the industrialization prices that if you like cold the problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay for it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the feet in Nineteen Ninety two house and then five at that time the developing countries are doing the knock must take action first no it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually for the u._s.\nIt's no longer a viable argument to say that going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways to bypass\nThe mistakes of the north you'll be talking about the fact that we could ... tried to convince a pension funds to stop investing in ... but the question then is one of the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels or\nThe investments to the south and I thought about a good idea just shooting the problem is that great and so I don't think developing countries should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels\nThey should try to buy boxed that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic disruption do you think for a country like India that democratic that they see it\nMore difficult or easier to push through as an idea\nOf a democracy is of course is that everyone talks and very difficult to come to this is ... ... relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other hand\nI think that there's a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of spines\nAnd I think that if he can get social movements going in India because ultimately it's the farmers in India that going to suffer our water comes from a snow fed mountains and that's really going to lead to major challenges the mountains stock to melt the snow starts to them as in the mountains\nAnd I for consequences if you just try to look at\nThe agriculture sector in India the pool so sex to in India they were really suffer and there's no reason to take that into account and try to read visit our energy storyline\nIn Chile assigned book uh to the big reasons to India to make changes similarly big reasons to China to make changes do you think China may ultimately find it easier to make those changes because it's not\n[noise] China's been going for sort of both and strategy of growing all energy time said one but I think\nAny kind of well run country any kind of country that has a government that cares about its population will in fact be pushed by that population if that population as well informed enough about the risks that are coming down the line and are very near future\nAnd in a few years we won't be in the same place we are now will be much much worse off in terms of the impact we've committed into the system if that if that awareness is spread and if there is as popular mobilization popular awareness that we really need to change things faster we're going to face disaster and the poorest people the most vulnerable people\n\nBut I can speak they

to had knowledge of war president man is the son of North Korean refugees so one of the first questions I asked him was was this more personal and political for him\nAnd he said that he does understand the pain of for the separation of war I you know as I said his parents like North Korea Nineteen fifty three to never sell their family again and he said one of the reasons why he wanted to

peace in his poll numbers do grow up after any summit with Kim Jong un\nDomestically he does have a bit of a problem because people here are worried about unemployment rate I mean amongst young people for instance it's up to ten percent\nYeah than more than me educational ... he was founded by an American wedding cakes in mind that has raised millions of dollars every even gone to a building or by that then president and and John Kerry leaf by twenty fourteen however a number of gallows had come forward and matching they had been raped by the organizations main coordinated Macintosh jumps and\nHe went to prison and later died of aids but the fact that the charity will still able to operate\nUnreasonable funds despite the scandal on good people in Liberia now one month took up the story you know your long investigation on Tuesday was really young he's behind the film an optical release just today by pro public and time magazine\nSo the organization was funded by an American came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called west by when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier it was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money internationally and\nHe was the one who was on the ground that's like than girls often than managing scholarship program\nBut sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization students according\nTo their statements to police had been raped by their co founder how old are these children so the girls told authorities that they were as young as ten when the ... again ... girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names are given to staff at the time as many as thirty according to an internal jak to talk\nYou know how many girls were actually raped as a number\nThere was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that\nAre the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in his care or so when the rates came to light the organization essentially said that this was a community issue according to our investigation to minimize the role of the man who had been a central mount an organization had an intimate relationship with the founder they\nDidn't acknowledge the extent to which they had empowered him ... century said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations or wouldn't operating cultures and a challenging context may have contributed\nTo his ability to access to abuse them grow their mind ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in Hama Judy and what our investigation reveals is that when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be raped will actually affected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there are many other students who had been named as also his victims so\nWhat we know is that to students who are named dozens victims by indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so so very sadly there's a there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization really failed to confront and a meaningful way\nSo what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continued to operate to that you know if there'll be any changes of told to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think that after this took place it's certainly true that the organization sought to to strengthen its policies and sought to prove it's hiring practices and implemented the whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually there was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time two girls verdict for the first time according to their statements that the police so definitely

counting the millions of lives saved by the discovery of antibiotics and the use of the twentieth century\nWill the twenty first to see the end of the effectiveness one of the reasons might be the widespread use of herbicides which is adding to the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria\nThat's according to new research by scientists in New Zealand and I spoke to one of them he is professor jak hind them in from the University of cancer brand new Zealand to most of the connection between herbicides designed to kill weeds and antibiotic resistance\nLease surprising all all of that is that as you say we expect herbicides to kill plants and we expect antibiotics to kill bacteria but\nThe chemistry of these different kinds of agents and drugs are such that bacteria proceed both types of drugs as toxins\nHerbicide are not particularly good toxins for the time the bacteria that we study but the bacteria I don't know this and they react to them as if they were good toxins\nBecause things are or toxins because herbicides or core toxins they don't kill the bacteria so you get a sub lethal effect\nBacterium respond to these herbicides like turning on genes for palm that remove all those toxins from inside themselves to outside that\nMore potent like antibiotics so the herbicides in a sense aren't vaccinating the bacteria against the antibiotics\nAnd this is happening this person is on the way the most harmless of sounding places anyway ... thanks [noise] looms where people play with the dogs\nThat's right wherever herbicides and antibiotics may come together and they come together and these places because for example you might use herbicides on your lawn your cat uh or your neighbor's cat might walk through your lawn what back into someone's house where they're stroked\nThat puts her pride and application levels on their hands and they may touched their mouth\nIf there are also on antibiotics or if the taxes on antibiotics we now have a combination of herbicide an antibiotic in this latest study\nWe found that that particular combination when herbicides and antibiotics come together\nThe development of antibiotic resistance can be up to a hundred thousand times faster than when there is no herbicide\nWhat can be done professor\nWell first and foremost we have to have a much better understanding of all the different kinds of chemicals that are in commercial use for their impact on bacteria these sub lethal effects on bacteria presently were unaware of any regulatory process in the world that asks these kinds of questions\nWhat would happen when these bacteria are exposed to sub lethal levels of chemicals that are people are routinely using either in work or at home\nThen once we have some sense of what kinds of combinations of chemicals could induce antibiotic resistance that could inform us into possibly revising what we think of as appropriate use of the different kinds of manufacturing chemical\n[noise] can you imagine a post antibiotic era\nI can imagine it but it's not a very very pleasant image the post antibiotic era will be like pre antibiotic era\nExcept we won't have the hope of new antibiotics so we have to be very very careful with the antibiotics we have now and the fuel yet to be discovered so that they continue to be useful to us in the future\nProfessor jak kind them in more than a million people were
