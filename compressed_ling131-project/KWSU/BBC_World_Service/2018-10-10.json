very searing the onus presage at the end the use of this comes at a price which is not easy and we have to pay a price if we really wanted to fight for France opposed and values and you paid\nA very personal price which you reveal at the end of the book test it cost you your marriage to a man who kind of choice is a good man but he was of Pakistani Danish origin his view of his religion was different from yours\nHe felt that you'll find for what you believed in was dangerous to your family and in the end it seems that ruined your marriage wasn't worth it\nYes it was worth it because I think that there are so many people they want the recognition they support the revolution and they want the changes\nBut they just don't want that adults are all that white to their head up the
