statement yet on the perils of rising global temperatures the report from the into governmental panel on climate change was a un buddy\nSays the world is failing to hit the target it needs to\nThe top it should come down on this two important things to remember action needed is urgent an unprecedented about to say the scientist it's also feasible an affordable so warning on one hand and recommendations on the other\nBut does it all going to happen or to keep temperature rise a dumb will lead to change the scientists spent vast amounts of money and get to political agreement now you'll have your own opinion on how much that's likely to happen or let's hear Richard black who's director of the energy and climate intelligence unit\nHere in London think tank up Richard we'll get your analysis on the feasibility and the moment but first give us a quick roundup of what the report is saying we've been talking for ages about two degrees limiting the rise in temperature two degrees then now saying that isn't enough why am what needs to be done\nHere so we need to go to the terrorists to listen to this day or one or two associate's in sort of agree with that\nDuring a clip a woman to one point five Celsius so they commissioned this report from the into governmental panel on climate change\nOn really what scientists have been done doing in the meantime is to try and work out what the differences in in ... look like a one point five Celsius well I'll just to Celsius well there's some areas there were some quite striking difference she at one point five you had as many people exposed to water scarcity\nYou have one third of the number of people exposed regulating extreme heat waves and the impacts on the nature of Boston the different for example you could actually catch good bicycle raised a two Celsius whereas at one point five up to the deepest sense the mud and divide so quite significant differences between two what's\nInteresting is they trying to emphasize the knowledge and certainly the affordability but the feasibility of some of the solutions but I don't think really feasible having a look at it would not an expert on these things are really major changes to my lifestyle to the world's lifestyle what are they saying needs to be done\nWell that's right if you put it in context weeping using fossil fuels in an industrial complex for about three hundred years and the prescriptions to try and reverse that insists he is so he's a messy the Oscar I'm essentially you need to bring carbon dioxide emissions down see\nBut actually there are about twenty fifty just study is time um you know you ...\nIn Michigan emissions down to zero absolutely in every section of the economy can do it in low system\nWe know how to do an extra ... we know how to do it in ... we know how to doing anything\nWe know how to do in most areas of industry for example it's tough and agriculture and may be impossible in aviation so you bring the emissions down as close to zero as possible and then you have to do what's cool negative emissions where you actually suck carbon dioxide from the yeah\nAnd that can be done either through things like punching forests are offered technologies that do this so it is a massive change but in each of those areas it's feasible technically the question is what is it feasible politically\nI'm a huge expense now I mean they're talking about trillions of dollars to actually achieve this all day making no don't need to sort of the self interested the planet's going to die argument but they're actually saying actually if you spend that money now it might look huge but the the benefits will will justify the balance it out how do they do that's accounting\nDisney is marble Disney owns the main marvel movies

and the Chinese market\nWell yeah I mean they don't have a Chinese release date for venom at this point\nThey certainly would like to get one I mean one of the question going forward is that then it got really terrible reviews so we'll audience just keep going or will it level off after this first big weekend but the overseas market is and we're a much bigger and more important for a movie like

[noise]\nThe action needed is urgent an unprecedented but they say it's also feasible unaffordable\nThose were a couple of of the top line messages from the er into governmental panel on climate change like a science experts they are a un body and they have issued what's being hailed as one of the most comprehensive statements yet on the threats and the possible solutions to rising global temperatures we off\nPossible but will it happen\nTo keep a temperature rise to just one point five degrees we need to change society spend vast amounts of money and get political agreement now\nThen you'll have your own opinion I'm sure on how much that's likely to happen but we go to a bit of background to this from Richard black director of the energy and climate intelligence unit here in London\nSo we need to go back to the Paris summit in two thousand Sistine hearts went up until that point to Celsius hype and the sort of agree political soggy\nBut emerging from that conference wasn't agreement that governments would make efforts to restrain a club or wanting to one point five Celsius so they can be sent this report from the inter governmental panel on climate change\nAnd really what scientists have been done doing in the meantime is to try and work out what the differences in in ... like a one point five Celsius well I'll just to so just well that is some areas there are some quite striking difference she at one point five you had as many people exposed to water scarcity\nHe's had one third of the number of people exposed regulating extreme heat waves and the impacts on the nature of the different for example you could actually kiss goodbye to coal raised a two Celsius whereas at one point five up to the deepest sense the mud and divide so quite significant differences between\nTo what's interesting is they trying to emphasize the not necessarily the affordability but the feasibility of some of the solutions but I don't think really feasible having a look at it would not an expert on these things are really major changes to my lifestyle to the world's lifestyle what are they saying needs to be done\nWell let's see if you put it in context we've been using fossil fuels in an industrial complex for about three hundred years and the prescriptions to try and reverse that insists he is so messy to us I'm essentially you need to bring carbon dioxide emissions down to\nThe actually zeroed by twenty fifty just study is time I'm now you call\nIn Michigan emissions down to zero absolutely in every sector of the economy can do it in low system we know how to do it and ... we know how to do in ... we know how to do anything we know how to do it in most areas of industry for example it's tough and agriculture and\nMaybe impossible in aviation so you bring the missions down as close to zero as possible and then you have to do what's cool negative emissions when you actually suck carbon dioxide from the yeah\nAnd that can be done either through things by Ponting forests are offered technologies that do this so it is a massive change but in each of those areas it's feasible technically the question is what is it feasible politically\nCan not only the sort of the self interest at the time it's going to die argument but they're actually saying actually if you spend that money now it might look huge but the the benefits will will justify will balance it out how do they do that's accounting well\nIt's a difficult one to do because I'm just trying to buy a new mix a un do those things actually comments being

squeeze the moon is is here from a business desk um it's not suddenly looking in such bad shape is it but what all the problems\nNo it's not suddenly it's just that it seems to have come to the fore

situation is a little people all over the fear or what what's what's to come\nThere had been hopes not a credible election earlier they see it would give the international community some confidence but it could invest in Zimbabwe and also perhaps convince institutions like the west bank extent sure to learn money to the country again but that hasn't happened how that because we didn't see that\nSo it's about what it should be given legitimacy tradition that took over after Mr McGregor last November unfortunate because the election was so going back to that nobody has confidence in

precipitation assessing drought assessing even smaller scale features like tornadoes\nThat right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\nOne event that will down please be scrutinized in the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which rules so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks back\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains the central ways in which climate change could exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his mobiles was suggesting we were heading for something rather comma\nMe issue and mea culpa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly inactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these storms tend to strengthen\nTemperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event as it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but at woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got a new Shani heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you\nYou are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before foreign made landfall ... raised with scale full when some of the Atlantic song Clinton expert Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was in the forecast simulations that we did which are very similar to a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was the most pacification overland after impact of the storms with fifty percent increase due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kinds of description outside from friday also which used as a great to likelihood of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strengths of the event is being changed\nYeah so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of the event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the ... Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in an extradition could pinned down specific country changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of past research by climate scientist and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so there's warmer area than cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initial education so that when we run the modified forecast with our climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that had on the atmosphere temperature as well as at a certain temperature changes that have on once during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere\nGreenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for throwing out just doing a uniform a changing of the team we actually have a pattern change of the ... the ... that comes from the fact that\nThe kind of like a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that it actually included in the set up\nThese patents have geographical variation can lead us look\nUnder the bonus of climate change so to speak with the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann particularly in the like the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius\nSo there's a very large region in the Atlantic the sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that is right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier\nWere seen storms turn into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nIs marginal changes to the Atlantic look potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic causing even greater along they may be named protected in many of the events that have mocked the past few months\nSea ice is declining rapidly melting foster most summers and recovering more poorly each winter Julian Streever of the national snow and ice data center was recently in the opposite

closed to set up and I can't and also thick enough to support many people out there doing their their field observations and also we tried to deploy\nAnd ice that may be a meter sick and you're hoping

thin and ... out then we lose our data\nTree in St Louis poses a research is directly related to the climate slash whether shoes off this program\nThe reason why we're so interested in the Arctic is that the Arctic is sort of a refrigerator of our planet right so it helps to keep our planet cooler than it otherwise would be and it does is by the fact that it's covered mostly by snow and ice year

sort of intriguing where repelled but are you feeding of voyeurism in all of\n'em I it's definitely there\nThat none of that that we all like a good murder mystery and if people are going to be scared by crime I drop it there was scared by two crimes then but really it's an honor fictional crime that makes things totally unbelievable\nIn your view is important if we're talking about how a body can be dismembered if you think it's important to get into detail how difficult it will is because\nThere's so few people will ever become a member and\nThe chances that what I'm doing is educating them dreaming least plan but some people who read forensic no are probably more forensic clear where than any any part of the public has ever been before\nAnd they can quickly smell like something that doctors signed drawings so when I have a huge amounts of respect for the crime writers who actually go Landry search warrant they really like so that what they're doing is they're respecting their readers to frame this is reality I Know it's just made this out\nThis is actually how it would be a factor that\nA book which is full of extraordinary stories and you described so many countless experiences you've had with that but what you do you do and I don't know whether you feel like doing it now is is share your own feelings about what happened was off to death\nIf when you looked at all of the dead bodies it makes you more or less convinced that there is nothing else or whether you believe having seen so much that there is an afterlife\nI have no idea that when I get there [laughter] that's how I come back to retaliate as far as I'm aware and nobody has ever genuinely\nBut there comes a point beyond which you don't come back we don't have his own base I spent my entire life with a death and I've never seen it goes in my life the sperm living spoke to me the living or we\nStay there\nGet health insurance so totally rational about it I mean\nI have the conversation

somebody else which often to end it at the end of the day but why should we weren't ...\nNo well more let's go and get into why should we worry but whether I just don't know whether it's possible for you to apply the same\nRationality and launch it for example to your own loved ones because we believe in this room experience probably most of us about all this experience best within our own families and I just wonder whether you when you experienced a death in your own family and I know you've lost both your parents whether your feelings upon viewing\n... has been different from the feelings you took my new to Kosovo or to Thailand to those major police investigations what my mother died a\nHealthy that's within six weeks and my father took a long time to die because of climate and what was hard once they're dying\nThat that wasn't hard on them being that wasn't hard it was watching what they went through it and the dying practice that\nSo whether that was painful I thought it was a protracted whether it was there was something that they they never wanted to be um friend came for them it walking up to loosen up early for them and every body\nAnd being that they were a lot smaller than they weren't in life they look very small very strong can\nBut they were gone and there was something\nTo lose a metaphorical thing as well ju ju feel I mean again it's digging deep into sort of typical things but when you saw your shrunken dead father did you feel his soul\nAt my own but that point my father had\nBeen on believing the soul so I guess but he doesn't\nKnow because something happens then something changed I was there I held his hands when he took his last breath in life and I felt there was nothing more than I could have done in front of that also not it was the most privileged place\nCutting off he stopped drinking he stopped the things he turns us face in the wall and he decided he was going to die and when he took that that\nAnd under raffle that you hear when they talk about the frontal it's pretty much the fluid that goes into the lungs that comes on was the last breath than I knew he'd gone and I had no trouble leaving my father's body but I Would never have left my father is still alive and in the last breath\nSomething changed but my father used to be on the boat he that was left with not my father it was just a vessel that he'll ... for his entire life my father had gone he had died is there something beyond I don't know until they get their thoughts\nTo general fear you\nKnow for the call I think it is the law grace adventure you're going to do it once in a lifetime [noise]\nUm if you're going in a long journey you'll always prepare for that journey why why do we know prepare for dying\nAnd I think I Want to experience every single moment to offer I Want to know what's it like to cause I can remember being born so I'd really like to know in those last stages this is what it feels like this was for the signs like this is

important or even simply European Union as a whole Jeremy classroom economists columnist and correspondent in Brussels and we can speak to him from that now could morning Jeremy good morning [noise] this being zeroes on Mexico for debt crisis\nI think it may well be and it was the last few weeks had been hopes here in Brussels particularly within the European Commission that each delete government would be persuaded to back down on some of it and spending proposals and tax cuts\nAt not tell it hasn't been the case in the sense here is that there are people that the commission can talk to an room for people like for example Giovanni tree of the finance minister but then the people putting the strings and those pulling the strings to the leaders of the two parties and the coalition the leg and the five Star Movement have their own plans to ten minutes on the confrontation\nWho holds the upper hand in a standoff to sink I mean at the end of the day it sounds ... not Tamms has the interior minister ... is the guiding light to the leg I is is is not going to back down at me [noise]\nI mean ultimately did did you catch it is in the hands of the ... who now is the dominant figure in Italian politics he's the he's the interior minister his leg up hockey has sold in the polls it's now much more popular even in the fight\nPatient with the European institutions we just heard from Mr bogey talk about the European Parliament elections next year Mr Mr ... dramatizing the idea that he's standing up to Brussels we saw for example when that bridge collapse in ... ... ... a few weeks ago Mr solving immediately blamed your for that Europe's faded to invest in China destruction\nAnd I think that's the conclusion that people here who've come to the to the Italian government particularly insofar as it's driven by Mr ... is determined to take on Europe will be things take on Europe and that means a major bust up in this budget\nBut do you think that there's a lot of posturing headed in the end they'll just have a line that they'll have to tell you that I Know oh could date way to take this to the brain can ... it creates a real down to where it really affects the markets that really effects and that one of the year than what I think\nI think the the the best case for optimism seeing from the European institutions perspective is that the kids will definitively government you've already talked about Italian public perceptions of low spread it said that the un it's a talent governments ...\nArising here but there was a Gemini and and at the same time you hit people like Mr ... I mean I was astonished his thinking on your interview with him that he was saying for example you know just what's the difference between one hundred percent one hundred and thirty percent and there's no risk we fought for the findings refinancing ... that\nThis is not a government living in the realm of of economic reality I'm afraid and and it doesn't seem like government you know especially with insurance if you just now leaving itself much room to back down as it is\nI added to that you have to include the but the fact that there is now the competition within the government between the lake are\nNow the dominant force on the five Star Movement which used to think of itself as a dominant force and so I I can see this becoming a set of competition between the two a governing coalition partners in Rome as to who can be tougher who can take on the markets you can take 'em Brussels more\nUm you know we've we've seen the language escalating we've seen ministers accusing Brussels market terrorism was one phrase used um and and I think this this'll this'll points in the direction of um of of of a of a major showed which the Italian government actually embraces penalties imposed from Brussels over its budget deficit\nHas got macho politics in it absolutely does does cloud ... of the name of how we could have a point I mean from the gym and they've gotten away with overspending and and you know feeding their public debt limit that sets out by the e y con ... just do the same it is one rule for them and one rule Satan isn't it\nNot the turkey and reasonable point and I think the the the with them and the commission particularly miss the most could reach the commissioner responsible for\nThe late they conflict they they would actually denied the Italian government challenge to a theatrical lies to its its disagreements with Brussels\nBut I I think the difference I suppose picking people here in Brussels all in in the commission would say is that when Germany and France overstepped that budget rules they were led by governments that seemed at least to understand the importance of those rules and we're willing to die that country's back onto\nA sensible path and then they look for example the Italian government budget proposals and wildly unrealistic growth expectations in those and say you know if the government we can do business with in the way that we could do business with for example the French and German governments at the time when they overstepped the deficit deficit limit but the European Union contracts food\nTo bailout his later this is this is the ultimate he's a big problem frankly\nIt's too big to fail exactly and and I think this this was to interact with of course the the ongoing debate about reforming the yours and where the the commission is treading a very fine line on the one hand you have\nA countries um like it to lead like but also other other countries in southern Europe or who's financing the weaker and who feel that there was no ... years and we've been pushing for greater burden sharing within two years and and on the other hand you have an old and European states or one of them is Germany but even more hard line on there is so cool new ... leaks of this new kind of\nA ... a Scandinavian states led by the Dutch who who are very skeptical about any further risk sharing within the earth and and that's all going to come to a crunch and mid December to sum it here in Brussels\nAnd that may well now take place against the backdrop of escalating a sort of tit for tat between Rome and Brussels which of course we'll make compromise at the summit very difficult indeed\nJeremy plus the economists color and correspondent improper thanks very much for that he brings us to the end of

a one point five and two degrees that are more than Twenty years ago so yeah the most significant one in the in the last Twenty years I Would say\nI Am glad to see the the information in the report come from how they put this together\nYou know basically what they've done is they've looked at all the underlying science on the variety of impacts the potential for cutting back on a mission for the whole range of scientific papers published in the last number of years some six thousand papers they looked at\nThe field that down into a report of several hundred pages and here in Korea for the

the golf I moved back to Pakistan more prominently when I was doing my eleventh so the equivalent of high school obviously we had a very close connection with Pakistan they extended family was here we came back every summer\nBut is it fair to say you grew up in in quite a privileged society\nOh absolutely I had access to almost everything [laughter] um went to good schools grew up traveling and

when you returned\nWas very upsetting Everytime when we come back in the summers\nThe haves and the have nots I think growing up in the middle east within the compound life where all the sort of ex pats clump together a group together socialize together we really didn't get a chance to see that inequity in society which is something which is the first thing you would notice when you come to focus on of course\nWhat was it that you want to be when you were little\nFor as far as I can remember I did want to study the law both my grandfathers were judges I remember spending a lot of my time

your enjoyed a good argument\nI think I was very argumentative that's what I was growing very talkative very argumentative or just the drama of courtrooms and uh the adrenalin rush that I Would feel

entrenched in deeply embedded corruption is in in our system\nBut at the end of the day it just it just fuel that drive in you to continue doing what it is that you do\nI don't think there's a question of stopping I wouldn't know what else to do\nWe've mentioned the seminal moment when you went to work for your grandfather's charity you were just Eighteen is this something that you factored in with your own children um is is it an exposure that you're going to be giving them at some point in the future\nI tried to take my son to prison once a year was about five he didn't really understand much he has an idea of what I Do you know his essays in in school will stand out for their content in some way or the other I think what I Would strongly encourage my children to do is to do something staying in Pakistan for Pakistan\nSimply because I think that with hard work the impact that anyone who wants to give back to this country are you know would just be so beneficial and and and so gratifying\nSo obviously your grandfather is central to the journey that your life has taken him once you become what does he think about your work your life and you know the passion with what you do it\nHas never said anything to me time [laughter] he's never sort of patted me on the back and said well done for anything and I don't know if that's what keeps me going I don't expect that at
