[noise]\nAs we answer a question that only seeing that probably the\nTown's alone can we live [noise]\nIt's all in the taste\nOf it [noise]\nHaving a tremendous development in life expectancy doubled our lifetime in a very short period and we should really be happy that we were born right on\nHe went to the many years then one day decided he'd had a number of treating in April [noise] he now runs the Danish aging with that sentiment while he's trying to tell people getting staff place [noise]\n\nWe don't know what age ... from the outside [noise] what is actually the two parties [noise]\nWell it is an accumulation of damage from the molecular level didn't spread to the\nCells and tissues and organs and to the whole organism make kind of all the hits that we get all the time on the molecules and then when we can't keep up with the repairing than a staging stops\nAnd when does it all began when do we start to decline that is in the mid thirties they start at the time say seven seven it's began to me yeah now the ... thought Oh thanks and that can mean [laughter] sorry\nAnd as more fattening once we start to go downhill we go downhill fast\nIt's twice as dangerous being forced you to compare to thirty five then again it's twice as dangerous as being forty nine compared to forty two and so on so your risk of death is increasing eleven twelve percent every year\nAnd a damn their mortality risk levels off around one hundred one hundred and five where the yearly risk of dying is about fifty sixty percent\nSo if you really optimistic type than you could say that it never get any worse than fifty fifty\nAnd when you're thinking about these on that a lump stacked against team when you age and you know molecules tissues and organs get tired and damaged set to go to a whole range of diseases\nCardiovascular disease cancer Roy ... Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's disease a lung bases all the major ones as well as the more kind of non specific you know people get more frail less resilient\nMain one wanted to know whether I'm Mike ... has an effect on how we age so she decided to do an experiment and what she needed was an animal with a short life span she chose a particular kind of one\nThey only live about two to three weeks so that makes them want it from all does a puff subject yeah\n[noise] she wanted to find out what would happen if you go to the ... micro biology wouldn't live longer [noise]\n\nShe chose one of the kinds of bacteria that live inside one gun tweaked it genes to make different societies and the fed them to separate groups of one [noise]\n\nA few weeks later she went to see the worms expecting them to be dead now they've reached the end of the lifespan [noise]\nI was so excited because when we find in a few cases animal and not that they're still alive when we checked them I was jumping up down\nFifty percent longer fifty percent yeah that's extraordinary\nSo you had the most of the ones who are living for three weeks and there were some that lets fool four and a half foot high ... yes I miss that much more than you would expect\nIt yes I think scientists sometimes the way to research this kind of like\nGambling [laughter] so we have some crazy ideas and you know we we did find a way to test them but you never know why they are idea is ride around\nAnd do some moment when you find that rates out that the government\nAnd so they went on to test other things would have different microbiomes give one little Tony a longer life but a better quality of life in that final days\nSo they're way with the right way can look at how they have when they're older because worm when they catch him over there that physical activity has declined so they little slower and also become a letter that al ... [noise]\nShe's got a video of some of these elderly one [noise] and she's right you can tell their own blog younger ones riddle energetically around him [noise] the older ones me learning their skin siding and say\nI don't think they showed rank habits but it can tell their bodies ... not as good as it used to be\nThe ones with the new like buying those honey wrinkles around will quickly in their old age that they would like to build to disease to [noise]\nMake wine is now carrying out tests on line to see what the changing ... extend satellites you so much on that one day don't just might be able to prescribe pills which do the same for us [noise]\nSome of my colleagues say oh hey you know I think people can live to two hundred say ... years so personally I think why jak for me is already ... [noise]\nSo how long can we live for [noise]\nBecause [noise] about the only person who can pick it up to a hundred and Seventy five [noise] and how different micro biome to give us fifty percent more time on it [noise]\nBases inventions around to trusting the symptoms of aging\nNot the cold [noise] then if we can go straight to the store [noise]\nTime for a final expert witness [noise]\nHearts\n[noise] you wouldn't believe the number of people\nI have had got in touch with me that slow on a hiring is professor of molecular genetics at the University of Exeter in the u._k. and scientists used on aging and cause a lot of people excited\nFor now it will be a bit of a holy grail actually and I failed now people are beginning to realize that this is a possibility and not wanting to get them now I think it's going to be huge [noise]\nI Want to call begins with the building blocks of all voting off sounds\nSo basically the organs might have different type of tissue your tissues a major different types of cells now I was told that some cells and say you live or your kidneys or whatever will be dividing to repay some cells to kind of dynamic I didn't want to know\nThe more time to sell divide the greater chance of becoming what we would call an accent\nAnd this is coming from the lesson would finish scattering which means to grow alone and that's exactly what happened to these cells they've grown old income to the end of life cycle but instead of dying they hung around I'm putting in a destructive ...\nThey can actually communicate with the cells random ... will basically throw out to a bunch of chemicals which affects all of the cells round them ... almost like a self saying I I'm an old south and you guys have been around here about the same sort of a ... ton of I have so you must be able to say you should be thinking about ... says well\nWow so so am I sort of contamination with age\nExactly so it's basically sending a message which can drive the cells around it and just messing\nThat'd be grow older more and more of ourselves becomes innocent until a buddy is overwhelmed\nWith any do they make themselves around them age that these innocent sounds stops tuning as they should which is still to be one of the things that lead to diseases like dimension type two diabetes\n\nOne with the she could get these sounds and don't have like old they'll have like a young one\nHappening that was I had her name is that true in my lap and she was still finding ... feet and we have some old south and I had some chemicals\nAnd she suggested ... percent should put some of these chemicals on these skin cells and see what happened\nAbout a week after she came in with a dish yourselves and showed it to me\nAnd when you look through the microscope what were you expecting to see\nThat they would still my own self so they look kind of lacy under a microscope and we have a particular died that we can put on I felt coaches the tons of blue if that's an excellent so when I was expecting to say is that the south with\nSelf to protest the hiring said oh no you've got the wrong side of these young cells go through it together\nAnd she did she did it I think again yeah and and and then we'll have the same thing again people about me and I still I wasn't convinced because we were not truly quite suspicious scientists and yeah I went with tools to to basically throw rocks that you're right there and if it's been ... that it probably ...\nHow many folks did you start ah probably about nine she did it about nine times and finally I kind of look to to ask them to actually maybe you're onto something had\nShe'd done something that no one thought possible\nShe defective Eby juvenile down south and tenements young so\nAnd they said why loan harried just now getting phone calls from scientists and investors from all over the well at the last experiment this reverse aging and human cells they think her discovery could be the secret to a much longer life\nWhen it comes to a lifespan St Louis in a hurry it's would be the most ambitious of on our expert witnesses instead\nOf human beings I think we have enough trouble maximum lifespan especially what I wanted to share such to end up paying he's a new generation of empty degenerative drugs we stood away off yet but in the future for things like dementia and cardiovascular disease what I'm hoping\nIs that this will allow us one treatment which will address several of those at one side of the people who would have died at age will then go on to live than not loaded lifestyle so how long can we live [noise]\n\nWe know the answer is at least a hundred and twenty teens someone's already got that song and from what we had that I think I'd like to ride\n\nWith the discoveries of on expert witnesses alone one day we may be able to replace the damaged Oregon [noise]\nTake supplements that give us a useful micro buying it still costs South Asia
