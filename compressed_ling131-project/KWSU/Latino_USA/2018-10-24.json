she says today's worries about privacy\nAren't all that new in fact there were a rash of technologies in the late Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds that me people feel like privacy was being stolen from them technologies like photography particularly instant photography and mass media\nAnd if you can believe it postcard\nPostcard came on board of course anyone could read the back of a postcard from the mail carrier to know the neighbor and so there's this you know small but I think very interesting and telling kerfuffle around the etiquette of postcard writing but people shouldn't be spilling their secrets on these cards\nThe rise of telephones also seemed to many in the public like a serious violation of privacy\nTelephone operators wiretap or is the various sorts party lines in um domestic telephone communications\nAll of these meant that people were communicating with each other about private matters but that a whole bunch of people could potentially at any point be listening in on the same was true for the telegraph in terms of communications ever telegraph cables both a government and criminals or various sorts it was well known could could tap into those communications\nSarah ... new book is the known citizen a history of privacy in modern America\nAnd she argues that the story of privacy isn't linear we didn't have a whole bunch of privacy and some previous era that we continue to lose piece by piece what we want what we demand what we hope for it keeps changing which brings us back to Abigail Robertson the girls\nBut when she got to the state level on appeal she lost her last enraged the public\nThe chief judge Bolton Parker said there was no quote so called writer privacy Parker was pilloried he went on to run for president against Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd if you've never heard of ... and Parker well you know what happened in that election then you ask meanwhile kept grappling with new inventions and ideas that required\nOften compromises and our privacy\nSocial Security numbers were one of those that that I think Americans really ... waide and made a trade off about that this number which did allow the government to track ones earnings and employment history and sometimes health history as well\nThat that it was worth it to have economic security and so in the Nineteen thirties there are certainly debates about this number a the Social Security number and we all know and maybe love and there are lots of debates about it but in the end Americans are are pretty willing to have that number in exchange for economic rights and economic security\nBy the Nineteen sixties and seventies than each of debates about privacy we're changing in some ways people are growing more open which we will get to but in some ways they wanted more autonomy enter in Nineteen sixty five Supreme Court case Griswold versus Connecticut\nYour personal details unless you're very carefully and deliberately opted out\nAnd that really rumors as Danah boyd who's written about this really nicely that really reverse a tradition where it was actually hard to get information was hard to get information out and to circulate it it flip flop that so that that was a hugely important part of the Internet and the way that it intersected with privacy debates\nIt of course gave Americans who have long um many long wanted an audience of some kinds right and a kind of influence and reach\nExactly that gave them a platform for their blogs for their\nThoughts for you know sharing their photographs of their meals\nYou know giving allowing their friends to the their movements it allowed people to do what they've been doing since the days of the postcard which is you know share information about themselves and and so those those too fast that I'm again have come together and really powerful ways in the\nAbility of now many many many people to look into and use that information in ways that we're not always intended of course by the people who put it out there to begin with [laughter]\nLet me just take a step out of history here for a minute we'll step back into it for a minute but\nI think in some ways people think of like history is a story of privacy being off straight you know your last summer with the with uh the telephone people can listen in to calls and the telegraph and then the Internet and you know and closed circuit TV cameras all over city that you just keep going and people know more and more about you\nBut in some sense if I if you think back to like medieval in London or something people living very close together walls\nSmall villages in small communities where everybody knows everybody and everybody knows everybody's business\nIn some ways like tomorrow if I Walk through Rio or Beijing or like New York city would know who I was I mean I can walk through anonymously and maybe privately I mean in some ways I feel like\nYou could argue that we maybe have more privacy than we had hundreds of years ago [noise]\nAbsolutely I think this is what has missed often in our contemporary debate this idea that the privacy of some ... some quantity that was there once [laughter] and is now gone and or eroding slipping through our fingers but no it's true that we live privately more privately in many ways ended people a couple of centuries ago\nIn terms of a White House construction ways that neighborhood they're designed homes are designed but also in terms of our very rates in our sensibilities sense of what should be private\nUm has changed and so it I think it's really a mistake to think about privacy its own moving in one direction um this is what makes it hard to chart and hard to kind of place at any given point but it's it's the exact and in certain ways even though perhaps we have less privacy in our communications today or around our personal information\nSay um it's accessibility to others\nWe have more privacy I think some ways in ways we live and the way we think about ourselves as private up people who ought not to have the date or neighbors peering in through our windows all the time [noise]\nSo what's your diagnosis of where we are now are we in like a lot less private than we were a hundred years ago\nI don't think so but I Do think that the substance of our privacy in our ideas about privacy rights have changed and changed in conjunction with all kinds of things technological developments date development a commercial uh and so on architectural even\nI think if I were to describe our current moment I think what we're experiencing are two different trajectory of coming together and have created a lot of problems I'm One of them is the ability for many different agencies to know us very well um by matching emerging technologies [laughter]\nThe other is this a impetus that many citizens have had since the Nineteen seventies to disclose more of their authentic selves on different kinds of media platforms those are coming together in ways that are I think I'm more unanticipated and which have meant that there is a ton of information out there about us\nSome of it uh kept by record keepers some of it disclosed voluntarily by us um\nMany ways to harness it so those two things have come together they didn't they didn't necessarily have to come together but they have and I think that explains are a scandal late in the moment you know firm Equifax to Cambridge Analytica and whatever is next\nTo Sara I go is the author of the known citizen history of privacy in modern American ... an associate professor

into Beijing hub turnover\nIn the Nineteen sixties cigarettes where you've been parents most of them around kids Dr ... you could barely turn on the TV but I think someone with a cigarette in their hand actor Joey Bishop who is part of the rat pack\nWith no exception here he is doing a spot for Newport cigarettes during his show on NBC\nHey boss listen to the Newport commercial I just wrote a expect you to write jokes not commercials but listen to this new port refreshes while you're smokes because only Newport combines mental find tobacco's and I ended up ...\nI've always said that about Newport\nAnd cigarettes they popular over the next few decades but then something happened cigarette prices started to rise health awareness campaign started popping up all over the country\nLittle by little cigarette smoking ... a few decades ago more than fifty percent of American men smoked now five and six don't\nSo what does it take for a social movement to feast on something as big as the cigarette industry and what does that success tell us about other movements the tobacco control side\nHas been so successful against the tobacco industry\nBecause they realize that the enemy here is not you know just Philip Morris or\nSalem or any of the cigarettes it's the brand that since these iconic images of the Marlborough man\nIt's Joe Camel that's mostly crunch field executive director of Georgetown University's global social enterprise initiative she has spent years studying why certain movements achieved their objectives like the fight for gay marriage or that campaign to expand gun rights\nAnd ... others don't what you learn from the struggle over tobacco she says it's how widely you have to appeal to the public tobacco control activists\nThe truth initiative organizers did a lot of cycling graphic really smart marketing research to really understand attitudes in\nWhat appeals to them and then created ads with you know the Madison Avenue advertising agencies that were doing the same thing for Marlboro and Joe Camel coming at it from the other side so you have to fight fire with fire\nYou know what's interesting about me too is that the challenges around gender equality sexual harassment sexual assault there isn't a policy or a law that ...\nSexual harassment sexual abuse is illegal right what you need to do is change social norms so if you think about one of the successful movements we studied in her book the anti drunk driving movement led by mad mothers against drunk driving you know there is no policy or a law that says you have to have a designated driver\nBut because mad both tried to enforce existing laws they also put forth a campaign around friends don't let friends drive drunk and that was actually invented by a group in Canada but mad had the chapters in the local presence to be able to make that go viral\nYou know decades before we had Internet and things we go instantly viral\nAnd it became the norm that if you're at a party and you see your friends had one too many you don't let them drive drunk you take their kids designated driver\nThat the social norm shift to behavior change\nSo when you look at me too I think a lot of this is incumbent upon men in positions of power who are the ones that can enforce their peers\nTo not engage in abusive um types of behaviors that movement thinking about what how do we actually shift the norm becomes\nApparent and then there's you know other things you can do as well like continuing to advocate and push for nondiscrimination laws having more women in positions of leadership in power\nIn the number one way to prevent these types of things from happening as well and you still have vast inequalities at that level [noise]\nMostly ... is the executive director at Georgetown

money in taxes on this list of what the government hot or not to get involved in he probably never seen the issue of rowing rights\nAnd why would you well says author shame it's been ... there is no ordinary race\nThe story here is that a few years back there is a farmer rancher in\nWest Texas in arid west Texas a by the name of William ... Jeff Williams\nWilliams and his family had their rights to a ton of water in Texas did they could ... the aquifer under their land no matter\nBasically comes down to is that an individual landowner has the right to literally pull up as much water as they possibly can as long as it's used for quote more or less beneficial purposes and that's the end of it boils down to whoever has the biggest pomp wins in the Williams is among the the bigger pumps\nMcGraw is the author of a Thursday land the making of an American water crisis he said that what Jeff Williams could not do by law we ship the water to other people who needed\nEven when drought began to played Texas in two thousand ten and even when that drought what's forcing some farmers to abandon their crops Jeff Williams thought the situation with Syria to say the least\nHe reads the newspaper that well you know what forty thousand acres or rice or being let go on a farm you know what I'm going to do I want to raise rice in the desert now to be fair it was only a small part\nIt was only a few acres was a test part [noise] it was more to make a point but it was to actually make a profit\nThe point was that despite the fact that race is generally grown in places like Southeast Asia or a monsoon batter the landscape with rain the Williams is could grow rice in the desert\nIn the middle of a drought and Matt McGrath argued tells us I'm mocked about where we're headed with water not just in Texas but in the country and the whole\nYou have the application of the federal to the state the abdication of the state to the local and ultimately the abdication of the local to the individual and that becomes I think that's a powerful challenge and how Texas response to this challenge\nIs instructive for how the rest of us are going to respond to the challenges for\nWhat we're facing as a nation increasingly played by both lack of water droughts forest fires and too much water much of it unsafe for contaminated\nUp until now water has been a classic government urging the individual struggle in America politics by another name but it can't stay that way McGraw says when we're struggling to find enough water for people in lots of American cities Las Vegas Los Angeles Phoenix\nSomething's got to get in Texas for him most clearly encapsulate that lesson\nYou not an accident [noise] that for much of this\nThey were very sparsely populated ... they were very sparsely populated because they could support very sparse population\nAnd technology it seems to me it's hard to imagine a Phoenix before air conditioning for example I mean the Phoenix today\nThere could be no Phoenix before before air conditioning there could be no El Paso there could be no there could be you know San Antonio today\nWere it not for the technological advancements that have taken place and particularly took place in the post war era\nSo the implication is here that we put too many people um or that they put themselves in the Las Vegas is and the Phoenix is the al Paso certainly given the amount of water that we have and those places and I I'll just say on behalf of those people like\nWhat I mean these are major areas as economic importance and cultural important are you saying in Thirty years they're going to turn on the tap and water is not going to come out\nNow here's here's what I'm saying I'm not saying that you know you're going to turn on the tap and and and ... and nothing comes up with sand sure of that is certainly one possibility but I think it's an\nUnlikely possibility the problem isn't necessarily that there isn't enough water in Texas is that there isn't enough water in Texas where\nThe population centers are this is true elsewhere in the United states we can go after that challenge but it's going to require that sort of top down view the other thing that it's going to require is the recognition that all water is not created equal [noise]", "show_name": "Latino USA", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "24"}
