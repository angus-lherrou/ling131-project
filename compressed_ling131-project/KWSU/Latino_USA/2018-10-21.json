it seems like Luke ... is the candidate who has what it takes to deliver taxes to the Democrats the candidate who is of the people and for the people law enforcement algae teach you peel the working\nClass well this is where that notion hits a bump in the road there's about thirty five people in the room we're in and we noticed a potentially devastating campaign for young people the civically lock their ah\nI'm I'm not really sure what we're trying to get\nThis is ray and I see that all the Howard county democratic chair and looking around the room there are no young people here at all and we are at a college there are students everywhere who is in session there's actually a room full of college\nAs much as the older individual I mean I think that's kind of our problem and

governor Abbott has raised over sixty five million dollars in campaign funds compared to the share it's less than half a million\nBut there's something else at play here something that goes deeper into lucrative I did as a candidate he did\n\nDuring the Democratic primary jolt technique is a political mobilization group for young Latino\nDidn't endorse the sheriff endorsed her rival Andrew white they said it was because of her record as sheriff of Dallas [noise] they pointed out that during her tenure sheriff cell does cooperated with federal immigration authorities by holding

you were a Latino when you were helping deport people so why should I Try to do now [noise]\nThe share of told us she didn't\nIs she did famously go head to head with Governor Abbott and twenty Fifteen she was refusing to honor ice requests to hold people who were accused of minor offenses since Andrew white lost the Democratic primary jolt is now endorsing her for governor but ... says oh\nI actually got or tax document\nI asked sure if I'm dead whether she will take on what some of the younger progress as want her to do to protect undocumented immigrants things like fighting to shut down detention centers and to stop deportations or you\nSame wired to that place but I don't have that power\nThis is a federal issue that the governor you\nKnow I wouldn't just make a statement I take action\nAction can be taken in this before\nIt's before is cruel bill\nIn is affecting the undocumented that it's something I can do\nWhat she's talking about is the ban in Texas on so called sanctuary cities it's a law called as before and it was signed by governor Abbott last year a red\nHe broadcast the moment in a Facebook my video as our son in law\nLiberal band sanctuary cities in\nThe law essentially forced to local police to work with federal immigration officials and it allows police to ask people they stop for their papers it\nEnsures that law enforcement officers in

then we ask her about another policy that many on progressive are pushing for\nIs abolish ice part of the\nThings to be reform\nHas seen about the original\nTask of mine was to keep people out who would do harm they've got away from them and it needs to be reform but do you honestly want nobody to make sure\nThat another attack on a major city is is not going to happen do honestly just want him to let him come in and and do an attack on the city's sounds a little republic and what you're saying I Know it doesn't it sounds\nLike we want to protect our country\nBorders national security rhetoric maybe she can make up for the lack of enthusiasm of some young Democrats by winning over some Republicans but that's not going to be so easy given how polarized the parties are these days when we were in Odessa we met her Republican voter at the Mexican restaurant who told us\nTell me a Democrat I Know where you're at where you stand is that is not where I stand\nAnd use that to sort of plow forward so we know for example that he went to farmers branch tax us and said\nI did the valley park let's keep going there was internal disagreement within the city council about whether they should keep going whether it was worth the money and he said no I can do the same thing for us for valley park and so they press forward ended up spending more than ... million dollars and they are law was entirely\nStruck down like we're not talking about towns that size of Dallas or the size of New York city it's not like they spent nine million dollars and they were like oh wow like they spent nine million dollars and that meant that they couldn't move forward road construction and so this was actually a material sacrifice\nOn the part of the town the only person who appears to have a really benefited from that is Kris Kobach\nSo if you think now about you know that strategy earlier to what's happening in the United states right now I'm you know what is what is the larger narrative that you see that's at play here in this moment in the United states when we have Donald Trump and the White House\nAnd directing a kind of particular perspective on policies regarding immigration you know I I think\nThat prior to Trump getting elected and prior to Trump being it's hard line on immigration has been it was really easy to dismiss people like Kris Kobach but now now does elements of the Republican Party are leading the country and he has a much more impact will voice than he otherwise what\nI think that we can learn from what he told us he believed that\n[noise]\nI think that it
