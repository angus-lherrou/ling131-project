the two thousand sixteen election but you continue to report the story particularly focusing on Ohio which is where you're from and obviously we're right up against another election right now\nWhat's your sense of whether anything has changed in the last couple of\nYears ... yes I I I mean I think some attitudes have changed somewhat I think ah speaking specifically about Donald Trump I think there is some chagrin among some people who voted for Trump in\nStates like Ohio who are not pleased with his behavior\nOn the other hand I think there is a reluctance\nTo sort of admit to that because so many\nPeople who are very broadly generalize over generalized says is the so called elite or the coastal elites or whatever have been telling people that they made a huge mistake and so there's there's there's a big reluctance to admit they made a mistake it's sort of like when you've been swindled nobody wants to open up to it\nSo I think there's still a lot of support for Donald Trump or almost as an act of defiance against people who\nAre doing well you know often there's this mocking among some of my colleagues frankly about the you know they talk about oh an economic and security wink wink nudge nudge when it was really racism or something else\nThe fact is it's not just economic and security it's insecurity about everything it's cultural insecurity gets insecurity about money and politics and where they stand in the world now\nUh the ground has shifted under their feet that feeling is still there in these places and in fact might be stronger than ever\nAnd you read about a study that estimated that ... ...\nIn Nineteen sixty seven in two thousand fourteen do people feel like Donald Trump is addressing that situation and the way that maybe they hoped\nNo not not specifically automation automation as part of a mix of this general shifting that I just described I don't think that they think that Donald Trump is going to be able to do much about that in fact they regard the coming of automation and artificial intelligence in other words but they've heard about as\nAs inevitable as the sunrise okay a and there's nothing to be done about it it's interesting that they have bought into this idea that\nWhatever technologists and Silicon Valley says there's going to happen will in fact happened and it's going to mean bad things for them they don't know what exactly bad things but it's going to mean bad things and they see this on the line\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nInnovation hub and Karen Miller [noise]\nIf you're a teacher that work you do may not be\nThat different from the work the teacher did Seventy years ago at least in the sense that you work in a classroom and there are students that's also true in many ways for doctors and mail carriers

the dividing line between the jobs that has stayed steady and homes that are new on the scene\nSplit technology obviously except it's the story time and not really he said American businesses how the idea of freelancing for a long time not just in this era of Internet startups in very low unemployment rate and the shift in the economy that we're seeing not about tech\nIt's about and the choices we may\nLose time it is an associate professor of economic history at Cornell University he's the author of temp\nHow American work American business in the American dream became temporary Lewis thanks for your time a real pleasure to be here thank you so when you hear people say things and I'm sure this comes across say you're ... ...\n... to get there and there's not that much security there's so much freelancing [noise] what do you think when you hear that kind of complaint\nIt's really interesting to me because there's a way in which technology acquires sort of an era of inevitability that there's nothing that can be done this is just the future it's algorithms and futuristic robots and in the book I really push back against us pretty strongly\nThat technology is neutral it solves business problems tech doesn't drive change a consolidated\nAnd things that you think happened in the last few years that are being driven by apps are really the byproduct of you know the rise of a certain kind of service economy that has been insecure increasingly insecure and unequal for quite some time\nUntil you wouldn't say then I guess that technology has always driven things you may think people think like\nTechnology and the reason we had the industrial revolution right that if the ... you hadn't had automatic looms then that never would have happened and then that the Internet is like I said you know the reason at all this temporary work is happening you just sort of don't buy that argument\n[noise] I don't and I don't think many historians do either it's really important to realize and it's and it's a story we're told so there's a reason why people think it's not just because they're confused at there just to destroy were told that the story of progress the story of technology you know the cotton gin and the steam engine and the railroad\nBut before all that was made possible there was a social reorganization of people are from their homes into the factories\nAnd the what historians call the industrial revolution which preceded the industrial revolution by about a hundred years the ... revolution the industry is Rob a bank not people became suddenly moral and hardworking but that they were\nPut into rooms together and supervised and you know they were waving textiles they were\nYou know making pots pottery and it had nothing to do with technology you had to do with simply\nOrganizing people in a row and watching them this is where Adam Smith famous example of pin manufacturing came from right it wasn't you know the idea of division of labor that you know one person could make fewer I tend to make a PIN we could make like three pins I could make zero pins I'm not very\nAnti kidding me you know at that but that's what we're doing\nExactly but if you sit down thirty people any breaks\nAgain and again and that these Skilling works that division of labor deters the foundation of capitalism and a lot of ways it's one of the foundations of capitalism\nAnd this is what we're seeing today that the corporation fundamentally was reorganized sometime or between Nineteen Seventy Nineteen eighty\nIn a new way that created more insecure lives for the rest of us and ... is the waste product of that service economy it's the it's only possible because the rest of our work lives at Starbucks and Wal Mart or so bad\n[noise] so if what you're saying is in some sense factories were created before the kinds of factories we think about where so many things are automatic and electric powered talk about and how the gig economy was there before even before the Internet forget Hoover\nAnd the Internet ever came on but it was really there before\nAbsolutely so in the book I talk about temp jobs and by temp jobs I mean jobs that are loosely affiliated with a corporation or a workplace and you can see them and all kinds of ways from consultants which are well paid to temps which are run through an agency to migrant laborers\nOr which are pretty much shut out of any kind of legal protections or workplace rights so distorted really begins after World War two when the first temp agencies come into being when the first\nConsultancy has really come to the foreground so here I'm Talking about manpower incorporated as the for for runner the temp agency and McKinsey and company as a foreigner of consultants and of course of the same time the ... program which brought guest workers from Mexico to the U.S for the very first time\nTalk a little bit about\nManpower ... which is still going strong it's a company that exist today but it started in the Nineteen forties before we think about the gig economy just talking about like the guy you started it and what we're hoping to do sort of how we ended up changing America\nSo all these different kinds of temp work really whereabouts supporting that post war corporation that was focused on security focused on stability and long term jobs and so the founder of manpower incorporated Elmer winter was a lawyer\nIn Milwaukee and one day he had a crisis where he needed a secretary to type up some legal nuts\nAnd he didn't have one so he\nCalled around you couldn't find somebody and he realized that this was not a problem\nDidn't manpower as a way to supply emergency replacement labor for business executives and for companies and this was a tremendous growth business they exploded through the Nineteen fifties\nThe by the Nineteen end of the Nineteen fifties he realized there was a limit to how often secretaries got sick or you know people went on vacation and you begin to imagine a different kind of workforce of workforce\nThat could come in at needed that can be a permanent the temporary workforce\nAnd yet people didn't do it and they didn't do it because of the reasons they didn't have the experience with it they trust of the people that they knew and they didn't quite believe that that was the purpose of the company the purpose of the company was to provide security to provide long term investments and all the things that are missing in the meaning of the corporation today\nSo then how gang he had a manpower convinced corporation to take that next step not just you know replace somebody while they were having surgery or like you said like went on vacation but um you know gee I'm\nOne of your work place there are a lot of the people who work you know with you interchangeable you don't have to make a full time commitment to them\nWhat happened was the first that there was something called the computer that became really important in the mid Nineteen sixties especially the system three sixty by IBM and corporations were entranced by it they were entranced by this idea of moving all their paper records to destroy records\nAnd or other I guess analog since it was magnetic tape but it is is is the sequester is a huge amount of work and so they look to manpower to make that transition and they hired\nYou know shift and ships and shifts of women as data entry operators and they were like wow that's amazing we could just take something that's important to us and then just hire manpower to do it and they had this experience with\nOutsourcing for the very first time something that was court to their own business so this is an experience that lots of corporations are having the late Nineteen sixties\nWhy oh why oh why oh\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nInnovation here on them you know we've been rushing headlong into a technological future I mean I guess you could make the argument we been doing it ever since the industrial revolution started but by the specially accelerate seems to me the late Nineteen seventies and the early eighties\nThat the author Brian Alexander who I talked to earlier in the show about how much new technology like automation and robotics has ended jobs and community especially in places like Ohio where he grew up\nAnd at first it seemed like great promise and there have obviously been many benefits of all of this technological change but I think one of the very destructive parts of it has been that it has contributed to this erosion of community\nThat erosion Alexander's that's been particularly powerful in states where factories have substituted robots for people and were solid blue collar jobs now feel scares but for those who are part of building the technology that drives our lives the start to change it had been going on for well ever\nIn the early eighties the job of being a switchboard operator was on its way out\nDaniel Theobald cofounded their bikes company ... and he now serves as their chief innovation officer\nI think in Nineteen eighty four eighty and she had forty thousand switchboard operators today you know a handful at most and nobody really that I Know of is really lamenting the loss of the ability to sit behind a desk and plug wires in and out of the switchboard all day long it wasn't great work\nBut the other side of the equation is really interesting for me at least and that is if you were to try and handle today's communications\nUsing switchboard operators it would take many many times the population of the entire earth\nTechnologies Theobald argued change they always have people who made their living constructing horse drawn carriage Ajmi drafted to order who had had chops at a time when men and women thought it was an dignified to go out without a hat all those jobs more or less ultimately came to an aunt you can't turn back time\nYou know we have one point seven seven six trillion dollars of our Indian investment globally Seventy five percent of that is outside of the United states [noise] Ninety percent of all the science and scientists and engineers who ever lived are alive today former deputy us\nThe anthem the sorts of technologies that can lead to fewer workers and car manufacturing plants we couldn't really the economy to called lived\nThis time that that were harkening back to doesn't exist [noise]\nAnd so the question isn't\nOh we've rushed into it the world has already gone there and in order for us to think about fundamentally improving the lives of the next several generations\nWe have to actually asking them to help us figure out how to you transform or or build totally new types of communities I Do think we're going to have to accept that\nAs new things are created some things that we remember witness tells your will no longer exists\nFlag is now the northeast region lead at the U.S army research laboratory and she and Daniel Theobald who started the robotics company agreed at the march of technology offered incredible potential for making our lives better\nBut in the short term they say our responsibility is to pay a lot more attention to people who have been displaced\nYou know when that when that person who's been working a certain type of job almost all of their life feels threatened that the world is going to change because of technology that's the real issue and that's a real hard issue to deal with\nSo uh you know we need to do a better job in this country of taking care of those people have training workers of retraining workers have having continuing education but to to blame the robots ultimately is counterproductive because we will end up in a place where we can't take care of the exact people that that we're trying to protect\nDo you feel like I mean you spent I think pretty much your entire adult life making robots does it feel strange when you hear all the sort of coverage in politics in the media about\nAutomation and and you know people feeling really alienated and upset because of sort of what technology in robotics doing does it feel weird to be a person who creates robots\nYeah it does you know one thing that uh is really important for me throughout the throughout that period of building robots as well as we've really been focused on this idea of how do you encourage humanity how do you make life better for people\nThat's got to be the primary focus and I believe very strongly that technology can do that and by and large technology has done that all the way back to the stone age\n[noise] um well is that I\nI Know you grow up in Missouri\nYou see not in Silicon valley not maybe in Boston or New York up but they're so\nMy hometown Sykes than trucking is the main industry there so there's a lot of conversation that I've had with folks who I Know who live in like stunned and their thoughts about listening to conversations about automation\nAnd they're scared and an angry that people talk about it like it's exciting rather than talking about the impact when I go to the farm the flip side is it's allowed small farms to continue to exist and to actually make enough money to be relevant for families\nIn ways that we couldn't have otherwise because having precision grading and no till farming and\nQuite frankly Roundup Ready cotton and things like this have allowed us to do farming with fewer people right I mean those\nTractors are basically robots that have satellite precision you know place the input here and so it's kind of incredible to see both sides of it where it's really enabled individual families to farm in a way that they could never have done and it's increased the yield of this land by\nJust tremendous amounts on the other side right you you see people losing jobs and so I think when you start to have those conversations across communities in the same town it's really exciting because then you start to see these debates between people who really trust each other\nAnd that's an intriguing again it's it's not having the technologist in charge of the conversation is tricky and you learn in D O D because\nEvery single thing that a soldier or an airman or a sailor and marine uses a ship a jet to write\nA submarine or these incredible pieces of technology but these are kids that came out of my home town right and we've trained them to be in this universe incredibly high tech\nAnd so there are these incredible translators between hey you know it can enable you and you can use it in an amazing ways and you don't have to be a PHD computer scientist to do it\nYou're listening to innovation hub I'm ... I'm Talking with Daniel Theobald co founder and chief innovation officer of vetting that robotics and must have flagged the northeast region only eat at the U.S army research lab\nDanielle let's talk about another strand of this conversation uh which I think probably doesn't get talked a lot about 'em in in most media uh because\nAcknowledge e worry um that the U.S and maybe because of some of these concerns is falling behind in the world in terms of robotics and automation are are now are we doing great and don't worry about it\nYou know because we have a very high standard of living here and because you know where several generations in from significant events in the world like World War two et cetera\nWe sometimes forget that the prosperity we have here in the U.S was hard fought it wasn't something that just magically happen because you know Americans are the smartest people in the world that's not the case at all and as a matter of fact\nI'm you know we need to think about the larger global community and helping everybody do well but there are a lot of economies out there that are highly highly motivated to win to improve their standard of living to invest heavily in robotics and technology because what they realized is\nWhoever owns that technology at the end of the day is going to have a leg up on every other region in the world\n... molested do you share those concerns do you worry that the U.S is falling behind when it comes to sort of creating cutting edge technology", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Latino USA", "city": "Pullman", "day": "31"}
