next dog is a little bit review foreigners diner no table just a couple of Congress and\nThe sound of a male female making ethical niche [noise]\nI've been positive in that like the next people mhm because of our own kind of history in this country that we're going to be bringing a different kind of politics yeah right and I'm just wondering where like you know what you think about um [noise] that notion\nTo be\nThe next or to be like the nah\nOur identity\nIs the most I Would say is the most intersection identity in the world [noise] so for example I'm Puerto Rican that means that\nI Know that I Am African [noise] I Am indigenous\nI Am also the product of European colonization\nI feel like to be like the nine and to fully acknowledge your identity and everything that goes into your identity means that we have to be in the causes that everybody in order to champion the causes of ourselves\nWhen you look at an issue like immigration phrase\nThese are these are indigenous people and this is their land [noise]\nWhat were your mom and dad speaking\nTo you and lick Sunday I meta\nProper thirty or forty was proud let being up for was a message like look on Sunday that you're in New York or through and through however you want to define yourself you know I was\nWith a very strong sense of patriotism a very strong sense as we are American I also was raised you are ... like through and through and\nSo I grew up like\nThe music I grew up around was Hector level that the ACLU and then hip hop in you know growing up around the\nBrand your favorite hip hop artist would be terrible and so hard\nI grew up around like public enemy and\nKnives Jay Z and then of course you have like this late nineties boom of I like you have ... do you have big ...\nAll of these people that we grew up around as well and so\nIt's it's to be all of those things you know sometimes\nPeople say like oh wow you're\nThe way you articulate your platform is the intersection off\nAnd to me it's not even that we're trying it's\nThis is who we are and so what what it means to be American and what we grew up and like how we grew up around the value that was\nWill go visit family in Puerto Rico every year but then we would drive to colonial Williamsburg what really yeah you mean like for the weekend or I mean we would take a little family vacation and it'll be like ... and you know William yeah those are like a two places where we went on family to cry\n[laughter] it was colonial Williamsburg I'm going to feel bad [laughter]\nHow do you manage that\nBeing a young enough you know a lot of people don't know if they you know it's not like you're walking around member of Congress drink me with you know Ryan um and at the same time knowing that you're going to be in Congress\nI think I'm Still processing a lot of that four months ago or five months ago I was completely anonymous or just like any other New Yorker no one cared about me [laughter] so just like psychologically that's been at the process but I had a friend come over a couple of months\nFor it with a bunch of other faces in terms of political developments of political ideas of twenty eight teams and she looked at it and we were laughing at it 'cause it's like it doesn't feel like this isn't my favorites is an island but we're laughing at it and she says that's what you are\nYou're in idea now and I felt like I had to be perfect or else I was going to be letting our community down\nSo that may be reasons to an interesting question are you managing your ego 'cause I mean the truth is is that\nYou're getting all kinds of call backs right and what is the kind of mind games that it can play because I'm sure it's also exciting to be on the cover of a fabulous magazine or a great photo shoot and all of that but at the same time it's also lonely\n[noise] it is and if anything\nThere are some ways in which I was more confident before the primary [noise]\nIn my brain and in my heart\nI feel very grateful and I feel very humbled but a lot of the experience of terrifying I feel like I have this huge target because I'm embodying\nSome of the most vulnerable people in society\nThe issues that I'm Talking about or not read versus blue [noise]\nThey're just not their top versus bottom and so\nFor me I still struggle with even conceding\nThe idea of getting a call back like sometimes I talked to our team and I'm like do you think so and still would respond to us and they're like yeah of course and I'm like will they or I still worry about people showing up to my advantage\nThere was an article I think it was in the New York or were they made a point of where you know that when you talk to kids you come down to their level mhm\nAnd I was thinking about that also in terms of the way you use things you know you talk to people you approach them you come in and you'll touched them you'll be named yeah are you thinking about it more as like wow this is a really affect the political tactics\nOh no no I feel like I learned it from my parents\nAnd when I reflect on my life experience I think of my my parents were funnily enough my parents were never political you know my family would always come over and we would talk politics around the kitchen table but my parents never\nOrganized or did anything like that\nThey were so good at building community\nI went to public school\nAbout thirty minutes north in a small town in Westchester but I didn't live that kind of class experience because in any affluent area there is an underclass of people who serve the people who live there and that's what my family was my mom clean the house the\nOf the kinds of people that I went to school with\nAnd my dad really struggle to start his own small business\nTo help support our family but it was always struggling growing up and it was really just picking up you know towards towards actually the end of his life and so my mom would invite\nThe cashiers from the local Dunkin' Donuts over to the house\n... ... talk because those are the people that are family could relate to\nThey were always about leaning in to people and the politics comes back and\nAnd that's how I practice as well\nEven though I feel very strongly about my beliefs\nMy number one job is to care about people and to lean into them\nShow them that they are cared for\nAnd make them feel hurt because I Am hearing them\nWe talk about the politics\nWhat is your puppy named you when you're hearing your dad now and then I think [noise]\nI don't know it's like I'm Still motion although [noise] I'm Sorry no with already to threaten oh my gosh [noise] so it's okay what is the prime tell me what your [noise] um just 'cause like [noise]\nNo one's asked me that question [noise] so [noise] it's\nWeird because like I guess I'm not\nA process even if you're asking me but it's like um [noise]\nIt's like having someone walking with you the whole time and somewhat and then like you're going months and months and months and no one's acknowledging the person next to you and then it's like oh what does this guy thanks\nSo it's it's a little emotional but um\n[noise]\nThe last thing my dad ever told me before he passed away [noise]\nWas make me proud [noise]\nAnd for a really really really long time [noise]\nMy dad had passed away my mom was back to cleaning houses I was tending bar and waiting tables and I felt like [noise]\nLike I had bills on\nKey to be depressed that it's something that\nNormal um also that it's okay to be flawed you know because we don't really see characters like that very much\nBoth in\nSociety and within our families and that's just not realistic at all and so I just want them to know the I I Know that they exist\nIt's okay it's okay to be who they are\nAll [noise]

and we looked at how one university Oregon State is trying to combat the troubling trend of Latinos not finishing college\nAnd a couple of weeks ago we looked at the future of warehouse jobs many of which are filled by young Latinos and ... and we wondered whether or not these jobs offer a path\nTo the middle class me stories were part of a partnership with the community service society of New York a nonprofit that among other things conduct demographic research to help in their mission of fighting poverty in New York City\nTheir data help to bring you these stories and today I'm sitting down with less are Christian he's the organizations\nDirector of youth policy to talk about some of that data that they've gathered about Latinos and education in New York City over the last year so I think\nLives are when I first met you you were like probably the geek you were like look I Love data I Love numbers the whole world makes sense to me because of data and numbers and there are a lot of you out there and the world [laughter]\nAbsolutely I think we live in times where what people are talking about can be a little bit uncertain and I find comfort in basing some of the things I talk about um real facts and figures\nOkay so every person who loves data has a story behind it you like this really wonderful story about what inspired you to do this kind of research and data so what's the ...\nThe particular line of work that we're talking about stems from one day I went with my parents I'm guessing it was about ten years ago to see the terrific show in heights\nLike suffer from Washington Heights affect the way can say a wake up and I got the little plug chase away\nBecause I actually grew up in Washington Heights where the shows about and it's a Broadway musical by somewhere I Know\nI mean I thought it\nWas a terrific show and displayed in all the glory of Washington Heights with some differences to the community I grew up in\nLiving together and most interesting to me dancing to the same music all listening to salsa\nWhereas my experience having grown up in Washington Heights that wasn't exactly the case it is a predominantly Dominican community and actually never heard of sauce until I went to college\nSo I started thinking about ... thought it was really great that the show put the communities on the map there the diversity within the Latino community that as a policy wonk myself I wondered if it wasn't getting out that\nActually the the different communities within Latino Americans in a New Yorkers aren't being showcased enough so I started digging into the date a little bit\nTo see well if I were to tell a slightly different story that there are\nReal differences among the different Latino communities what would that mean for the use policy field that I work and\nSo what did you\nFind what surprised you all working in New York City schools and in your policy field so much of your policy when it came to dealing with Latino you dealt with issues of English as a second language and English language learners\nAnd the first thing that jumped out at me was that you've got three really distinct communities that Latinos in New York the three major groups of Puerto Rican Dominican and Mexicans and the largest one Puerto Rican New Yorkers\nReally have no English language learner issues over Ninety percent\nOf young people of Puerto Rican origin in New York speak English as their main are are are best language and are born in New York City so I started to think well\nIf the policy field is sort of lumping all Latinos together around this one issue what are some other differences that we could find and then once I started to dig a little deeper a lot of new things started to come to the surface about differences in the communities both ways to make them great and then ways that we can support them to be even better\nI I really I Love this particular point that Dominican women have higher college graduation rates in New York City than any other demographic in the Latino population so what I think that\nReally interesting I think there are a lot of questions that are raised and a lot we can learn from particularly in comparison to to some other groups but Latino nominate Tina [noise]\nOne thing we think is that the Dominican community in New York like in Washington Heights is interesting in that you have a lot of groups from different incomes living together because it's a relatively new or immigrant group actually compared to Puerto Ricans\nThe schools that are majority Dominican schools you have both lower and higher income families from Dominican origin and what we find is that when you have mixed schools around socio economics the culture pervades\nThe lower income families as well which is why in those schools you really see much more of a college going culture and among women in particular which is it's real bright spot [noise]\n\nNow in comparison to Puerto Rican community in New York has been here much longer and you find that some higher and middle income Puerto Ricans cooked in New York and other parts of the country aren't living in the same neighborhood or where there is some concentrated Puerto Rican communities in areas of New York you're not having those mix of incomes in the school and the costs going culture may not be a strong [noise]\nMeet each still there's a whole conversation Ron desegregation of data it sounds like a very technical things but what it really means is when you're taking big data and you're kind of make it into smaller bite sized pieces is that a conversation that is being had regarding ... don't like the United states increasingly\nI think we're seeing the value of diversity in our analysis and now I think the next step is we're such a diverse community within Latinos how do we really show the differences within them and a show that needs and strengths of different communities\nAnd we're really on an exciting frontier as people start to think about diversity and identity differently\nOn the United states census bureau's animal Community Survey which is really the baseline survey that we use for so much of our work there's a question about race and then there's the next question about it yesterday so enraged people are largely answering whether they considered themselves white black or other than Asian background or other\nAnd then the next question is are you Hispanic", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Latino USA", "city": "Pullman", "day": "28"}
