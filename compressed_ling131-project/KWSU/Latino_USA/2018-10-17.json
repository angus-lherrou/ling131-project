[noise] ... so that the uh [noise] uh not city so I guess march and everybody down into a ditch and blowing them away [noise]\nHere we are supposed to be the good guys and the white had\nHugh Thompson had several choices in that moment and he could pay nothing to his fellow American he could join in with the soldiers on the ground or get try to stop them but given our biology and the culture that has been built on top of it trying to stop fellow American that was going to be pretty tough we\nAre primary we're mammals like a whole lot of them we're very very hard wired to devise a world and to us as\nRobert supposed to get the professor of biology and neurology at Stanford University\nWe process of them in a group\nOut grouped categorization was\nUnder a hundred milliseconds in our brain and some neuro imaging studies there are hormones that exacerbated the contrast between us being nice to us as being very\nAntisocial to them it's right on the water and\nI Would venture to say unless you are the the Dalai Lama and his friends basically all of us carry in us say capacity to make rapid us distinctions among the all the lights\nUp in this moment when Tom faced a choice the question was who in his mind was not an issue with the\nShoe Thompson a lifetime of you know American nationalist sort of Caucasian Mr Lewis and also\nAs well as others will challenge America security [noise] and the fairness of our beliefs as far as Steve and we stand [noise]\nPartially the ... century\nCivilians are made ally ... she protected at great personal risk and have them work has held them

[noise]\nI don't know how to sell it they would have opened up on that particular day I wouldn't have given it a second so [noise]\n\nThey were the enemy at that time I guess every day I'm sure they relate to the people on the ground [noise]\nThompson confronted lieutenant William tally within command about what he and his men were dealing with him later be court martialed and convicted of murder for the rest of his life Thompson which are warranted and derided for what he did in March of Nineteen sixty eight\nBecause they don't make any sense and they're not meaningful outside the context of the environment in which they occur\nRight and this notion that there's a bucket that certain genetic back it and the cultural back at it sounds like not at all they're just there's so much poorer between those bucket and you can actually he can't separate one from the other\nExactly here and like the invasion ... armed with Robert supposed to be a professor of biology and neurology at Stanford he's the author of the have the biology of human at our best and worst [noise]\nSo we've talked about culture we've talked about genetic if both of those have tremendous power very often beyond your control you you don't change the culture your new grow up in usually you obviously cannot control your genetics\nWhat does that say to you about free well and our ability to shape our own lives\nWell if you spend enough time looking at how we are shaped by everything from\nSubliminal sensory stimulus ten seconds ago to why humans evolved a way they are rather than being ... everything in between you spend enough time with that [noise]\nAnd you know that concept of free will start seeming mighty suspect ... one can argue till the cows come home with certain branches of philosophers but in terms of that I come out as what's turned to hard determinants I don't think there's a shredder free will help there\nUm I think free will is what we call the biology that hasn't been uncovered yet\nAnd when you look at the history of our knowledge\nAbout what biology has to do with behavior\nWe've spent the last [noise] I don't know couple of centuries or so over and over repeating the same phrase which is why I had no idea that sort of biology had anything to do with it\nI had no idea that an epileptic seizure or disease rather than someone who's been consulting with Satan\nReid rather than being lazy and on motivated has the cortical mal formations that we now call a learning disability and when you look at the sheer percentage of what we know about the biological shaping of our behavior [noise]\nNinety five percent of it was discovered in the last half century Ninety percent of the last twenty five years eighty five percent since you woke up this morning and all that it's been happening is\nThis analyst march of oh I had no idea biology had to do with that and it is already convinced is of that and some of our most fundamental areas\nAnd at the end of the day I answer you could conclude there's no free will whatsoever and that's my spouse or at least you're gonna have to admit there's a lot less free will than there used to be\nIn sort of western thinking in western values and judgments\nAnd it's getting squeezed into all sorts of really uninteresting places and that's just going to keep happening and maybe down the line if you want to win sister was free will while you've lost your upper teeth this morning instead of your lower ones go forth be happy [noise] but\nI think by all watch it again this notion free will is just the biology we haven't discovered yet\n[noise] does that mean you think that all the time in your own life you know am I really think it'd be interesting primates are is being maintenance of aging and again and I really choose not to eat that cookie or that already kind of make getting like who I mean do you think that all the time in your own life\nWill that's the problem um\nYou know a mid again I'm totally intellectually comfortable with the notion that there is no free will whatsoever at some ...\nWe are nothing more or less than our biology at the same time I haven't remotest idea how you're supposed to live a few actually started believing re there's obvious things to do which is completely revamp\nHow we do criminal justice and education and all sorts of other things like that\nBut at the end of the day like you know without question I showed that I'm a total hypocrite and there's not really in court brief dates [laughter] like if I give a lecture and somebody comes up afterward and says oh good lecture I'll say thanks so what I'm supposed to\nAnd this must be called right yeah yeah and like how do you function that way I'm a certain level\nIf it's good to be hard for us to accept that there is no free will when it comes to judging them and they're awful behaviors I'm going to be that much harder should accept inch absolutely justice applicable when it comes to us in our laudable once\nI Want to go back to something that you just mentioned the criminal justice system and what you do you think about this and it's all about choices people make and then how other people obviously choose to punish them or not punish them out for for what they did\nWell not not to sound like too much of a hot here as if I haven't already but let's see just to sort of stayed at subtly the criminal justice system makes no sense whatsoever there's there's no souls there's no evil\nThere's no there's no punishment that in itself I mean none of this stuff makes sense the criminal justice system runs on neurobiology that's close to two hundred years old\nLiterally in what's called him ... ruling the different species of knowing between right and wrong and other than that for the most part signal was the last two hundred years of behavioral science [noise]\nTwenty five percent of the men on death row in this country has a history of concussive head trauma to their frontal cortex\nAnd when you damage the frontal cortex\nUs somebody who can know the difference between right and wrong and they still can't regulate their behavior and when they do something appalling at that point invoking evil makes as much sense as invoking the notion of even when a car who's breaks the failed hit somebody\nAnd in both cases you don't leave them out on the street being dangerous but when you put a car in a garage because he can't fix the brakes and dangerous you don't sit there and say justice has been served\nAnd this car is not going to get to drive around in the countryside anymore on a sunny day it's just\nA mechanical problem and any horribly simplified way we're biological machines and if it's ... to turn this into machines and that way it's a hell of a lot better than demonizing Austin to having rotten souls when we may just have something screw with wonder transmitter system\nIs at the arts\nEntire section of a book store right that's designed to help you succeed Martin life so that you know books to help you find that to help you succeed at work to help you do on school I can make friends that are\nAnd but there is no need for that section if it's pre determined whether you're going to succeed at work or you're going to make friends or you're not\nWill but nonetheless you've got to incorporate the fact and their behavior changes yeah\nAnd it's not determined to stick in the sense that like a puritan neurobiologist would have set of Plymouth Rock or something right right but it's been said in a much more interesting hopeful way for example\nI'm conventional language that we would use you sit there and you hear about the story of Hugh Thompson and you come out of their inspired inspired\nShe did something amazing my inspired\nFear was nothing which Jordan or a about his upbringing\nInspired five minutes before that he was no more amazing than you or me push pants on one leg at a time it's after a while maybe I could be more like Hugh Thompson huge so we've just given sort of an English description of what it is to be inspired by somebody\nWhat does that neuro biologically and the fact that a human can do what he did\nAnd the fact that you just heard about it\nMight very well change something in your ... and two and a half more neurons than we're working this way this morning are now involved in a sense of advocacy and doing the right thing when it's the terrifying thing to do\nWhen you're inspired when you're demoralized when you're deflated when you're for you to buy something those are as biological phenomena as anything else and they leave their traces\nSo the fact that\nWe can learn about the nature of the world and the process by definition\nThat changes the nature of our brains are subsequent behaviors um is totally compatible with us as determined to stick biological organisms it just tells you go when study what the most efficacious ways or to like bring about good changes and lose friends of ours\n[noise] Robert de ... is a professor of biology and neurology at Stanford he's the author of the have the biology of humid at our best and worst Robert thanks\nWith that in the

I'm sure I'm\nIn the Nineteen teens a man in his mid thirties got sick she was a relatively powerful man in assistant secretary of the American navy and by the time he got sick\nIt was clear that his illness was part of an epidemic sweeping the clubs and know that as a secretary whose name was Franklin Delano Roosevelt did get better and he actually went on to contract polio a few years later the illness that taken him in Nineteen Eighteen\nReshaped our world it was the Spanish flu which might not roll off your tongue when you think about the most important events of the twentieth century but it\nKilled between fifty and a hundred million people possibly more people than the first and Second World War II combined [noise] so what happened was they would stop out\nWith the same symptoms of flu that you and I know in a normal flu season if I'm lucky sore throat fever headache\nAnd then the unlucky minority would have to trouble breathing they would ten blue in the face really would tend to black and at that point and it was really no chance of recovery on it depended on the individual but could take hours or days um but they would die\nWorst spinning is the author of the book pale writer the Spanish flu Nineteen Eighteen and how it changed the world and she says by the time the flu came along the world had been at war for years and people are exhausted\nAll other people's lives are in a sort of ... and you know that it was the end they had invited the huge um punishment from good\nThe Spanish flu which by the way with not Spanish it was called Spanish because Spain printed more information about the flu than many other countries\nIt killed at least thirty times more people than die in a regular flu season it also altered the way we think about all sorts of things from viruses to preparing for pandemics so is the Spanish flu something that society has confined to the dustbin of history\n... says it all come down to the power of narrative I think that would lend themselves\nThey make that just sort of beginning a middle and an end whereas the Spanish flu just struck people will completely wilted and then it had practically gone by the time they'd realize what it hit them so as you said even though it was a much bigger disaster in terms of the number of victims it kind of got lost in the easiest stories you tell\nMhm I Wonder too as in some ways the Spanish flu kind of like World War one with a lot more lethal warfare than we'd ever seen was the story of like the modern world emerging and you know I told that story about FDR\nGot to Spanish flu but recovered by God at and when he got it I Believe he was on a ship from France to New York which you spoke to like\nThis was a world in which global\nTrading routes and military roots and stuff had had really permeated the world we were a global society and the downside of that was\nThe flu hitched a ride on that [noise]\nYeah you know I mean I think we talk about the science world wars the as the kind of St Louis or science um because it causes death on an industrial scale it gave us a weapon and the technology that allowed us to kill a number of young men in an industrial way\nBut if you think about the flu was a massive failures science because science and math and had nothing to offer to combat this disease and you know it's kind of no coincidence that they happened at the same time the ex but pretty much agree that the reason the Spanish flu is so bad", "show_name": "Latino USA", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "17"}
