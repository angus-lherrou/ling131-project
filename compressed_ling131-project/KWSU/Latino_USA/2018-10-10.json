in large chunk of my conversation has twice single top that after a while I got on the topic and he started asking people about him directly that generally unless it is\nThat's about it that's all I can describe it as just pure theory I feel\nVery um [noise]\nI feel angry you feel a little bit on patients\nUh it's really stressful I\nAm initially angry and then I settle in and say turn up the tunes gets fought a fire going and just relax it's either that or take a Xanax and I don't have a prescription yet\nThose were commuters we tracked down in Atlanta and Chicago and they're talking of course at that traffic something that affects the health mental state wallets family life and worked options as so many Americans\nWhich kind of makes you wonder could traffic be fixed or is it just didn't attract us in our cars from one more time each year\nThere's general agreement the congestion in our major urban areas is getting worse\nMichael ... a professor of urban planning at UCLA Luskin school of public affairs his focus in traffic and he said if you live in or near a major urban area you probably spend a chunk of your day in gridlock\nLos Angeles New York Washington DC that metropolitan area San Francisco Boston Chicago Atlanta\nIn general the bigger and denser city you are the more traffic congestion roads have\nRush hour to expand it as we try to avoid driving at the worst times a day stresses grown as people grapple with the unpredictability of traffic so when it could take thirty minutes to get to work and the next day takes fifty and that caught don't end there\nOne of the most under appreciated impacts the traffic congestion is the pollution that results from it\nWhen vehicles are idling and moving slowly are just going stop and go around ten to Fifteen miles an hour\nThey amid much more pollution a damn it more carbon which sort of matters for climate change and sort of these global concerns\nBut at a local level they're likely to him that much more sort of what we called local missions or the or local pollutants like fine particulate matter or benzene and things like that and these have been strongly associated with increases an asthma\nIncrease and other respiratory diseases or increases and cancer and most especially increases in a premature birth on low birth weight\nThose costs Mandel says are mostly born by people whose homes are between five hundred and a thousand feet from the congested road which means that not all of the costs\nFrom last time it's the drivers who suffer from stress hits the drivers who suffer from most crashes but you also have people who just live near freeways and those folks tend to be a much lower income than the population at large and they breathe a very polluted air\nActually means he spent some serious energy thinking about how you make traffic better noticeably better now politicians also say they want to make traffic better by Mandela argues they've tended to embrace solutions that the president doesn't quite barren out\nCertainly the most longstanding approach to fighting traffic congestion has been to build more roads right and that could be building entire roads which we don't do very much anymore or it could be widening existing roads which was very very popular\nWhere they take money paid by folks who can afford it and use it to help subsidize access to the goods for people who have less money there's absolutely no reason that we couldn't do the same thing with congestive prices\n[noise] how do you know at work and where has it been tried like where can I go to see that [noise]\n[noise] okay so I think there's two ways to think about this one is that if you just think conceptually about what traffic congestion is\nThen you you understand the pricing is the only thing that solve that problem so again if you understand the congestion results because of very valuable asset is under priced and so as a result too many people want to use it at a particular time\nThan just logically the only thing that is going to ameliorate that is making it more expensive at that time so that's like sort of just the the logical or conceptual basis behind it if you want to see it in action Singapore has used some version of congestion pricing\nSince Nineteen Seventy five I Believe around and it has used sort of more sophisticated electronic road pricing since the late Nineteen nineties early to thousands a Singapore is a very dense city it's dancers in San Francisco\nIt's freeways move pretty consistently at fifty five or sixty miles an hour oh you can also see examples of this along certain\nWhat we call high occupancy toll lanes throughout the United states that's our Ninety One roadway in in orange county for instance is a great example it's congestion priced roadway that sits in the middle of a free freeway in orange county okay and during rush hour you will see traffic snarled\nIn the free lanes and zipping right along at fifty five sixty miles an hour\nIn the price planes a variant of congestion pricing is it at work in places like London and stock home where driving into the center of the city and this is not freeways but this is driving into the downtown you encourage charge to do so\nAnd that has been very successful as well the first day of London's congestion charging\nParty line it's not partisan doesn't matter whether you're a Democrat or Republican if you're you know stuck in traffic every morning\nOn but I have not heard a lot of politicians talk about it do you see we've kind of a local thing but you see mayors are governors I'm Talking about this doing congestion pricing really trying to make people's commute a better\nSo congestion is absolutely a much bigger priority at the local and sometimes the state level than it is it's a national level right it's not something that the national government has a lot of concern or authority over\nAnd it's also just not something that even if you look at polls you know if you ask them an American and a Gallup poll or something like his congestion bad they say yes but if you ask them like name the top three problems in your region\nHoly and a handful of regions just congestion rank really high mhm so I think if it becomes much more an issue that mayors and city council members are and in smaller states like Massachusetts governors tackle\nAnd the question of you know\nDo I see these little acted officials embracing congestion pricing what I Would say optimistically is that more people are willing to talk about it now than they were ten years ago I think it's a hard political cell I mean this is people are very accustomed to the roads being free\nThey're also very accustomed to unfortunately policymakers having told them to other things would solve congestion being told that because we're building transit or adding road past city\nThe problem was going to get better so I think it's been difficult to sort of go back on that and say actually we were wrong the only thing that's going to solve this has pricing [noise]\nBut I I'm optimistic that as more and more places many of them outside the United states uh experiment with this mayors in the United states will look around and say you know [noise] there's no reason we shouldn't be part of the success [noise]\nMichael ... associate professor of urban planning at the UCLA Mexican school of public affairs his research focuses on traffic Michael thank you so much for having\nMe\nAnd my thing\nYou heard from some commuters in Atlanta and Chicago at the beginning of the segment for me that's what the world will look like without traffic\nI can\nUnderground tunnels train because then bring it on although it seems kinda jets an issue to me I cannot

amazing I I Love the city but it's so\nA really frustrating [noise]\nFeel like that would be a real life\nAnd so\nWe've got lots more about men does idea congestion pricing how words places where it's

engaging\nYou're about to hear from one scholar who's been working on a plan to do just that\nJust because he's been in the economy that's been on the upswing for several years feels like in the tug of war between corporations and workers corporations are winning many workers are seeing their wages keep peace with inflation\nHeard not even politicians talk sometimes about bringing back a factory jobs for them\nBut lots of factories now rely heavily on robots and lots of factories\nHave moved overseas is Dennis Campbell says\nBlue collar workers need a new blueprint for the future and he's co authored a plan to make that happen [noise]\nCan't say it's a company in Milwaukee called gardener Denver it makes ... meant and he tried an interesting experiment giving blue collar workers something that's usually just given to those in the corporate suites\nAnd they have you know for the first time I'm for many of these workers right on the production floor or have actually given them stock ownership a in a firm and so really what that does the signals that we're all in this together\nCampbell worked at the Federal Reserve and he's now a professor of business administration at Harvard Business school he notes that were any transitional moment and many companies have dropped the ball\nBut why if you're an executive shoot you get stuck to people on the factory floor to workers in the chain restaurant or to flight attendants will go back to a gardener Denver for a minute there are certain aspects of business at the company wants to get better at more efficient at\nAnd it helps to have every brain focused on strengthening those areas\nNot just the brains in the corporate suites\nWorkers that are sitting on the production floor that are sitting in purchasing that are sitting there in a child's receivable they can find ways to kind of manage that and if they all do that collectively that will add up to a value for the from his whole and then they all share that they're all in together and I think that sounds really\nComing up what we look at the seven deadly sins that allowed them for the call and a little more biological underpins\nSeem very coal human instinct to a
