yes yeah it's like a whole thing I don't get it either but like this has seven hundred thousand views\nAnd it's just like this dude tolerance and like driving a forklift around trying to pick stuff up and like put other places now but when I think it's funny too and I want to show us like if you look at the comments\nSome people are like giving tips but like I drive a forklift and they don't go super fast but it feels like they do when you're in close quarters in warehouses maybe thirty five to forty miles per hour someone else's like keep your forks low to the ground when traveling like under six inches high prevents loads from tumbling off the forks I'm a forklift driver and\nHe had all these people they commenting like actually drive forklifts ... and the reason I ended up watching this weird Youtube video is that I've been spending a lotta time doing research on the future of jobs and the economy and in fact I found out that a lot of our future jobs involve forklifts\nAnd that's because one of the fastest growing industries in our country today is the industry of moving and storing stuff especially stuff that we order on line\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWe're going to start our show by diving into one of the fastest growing part of the American economy it's warehouses [noise]\n\nWarehouses hardly in between space that all of this stuff from cat food to fuzzy socks flows through on the way to us and the industry is a blow to\nThe twenty third team then\nObama visited an Amazon warehouse in Chattanooga, Tennessee and he gave a speech about the future of jobs in America with a particular focus on getting a better bargain for the middle class\nAmericans are jobs are homes and there's been a part\nThe long term ... has\nWhen it comes to middle class you're\nObama talked about bringing back manufacturing jobs but he was also there in Chattanooga to highlight job growth in other sectors Amazon adjusting though that it was hiring thousands of workers for its warehouses nationwide\nNow over the next two years experts are saying that the warehousing industry needs to hire over four hundred thousand workers just to keep up with the growth and e commerce so the jobs of tomorrow are actually warehouse work\nAnd many of those jobs will be held by Latinos and ... is currently in about forty percent of Eighteen to thirty four year old working in the where housing business are Latino\nBut are these jobs that are taking over and he really good job\nOffering immunotherapy and other personalized treatment options to address patients individual

learning to drive forklifts and how to organize inventory in order to prepare them from working in warehouses\nNow our producers of your buddies that car is taking us to a real warehouse where these young people might work one day\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nIf you remember Patterson, California had all of these warehouses over by the highway and it's a perfect place for them to empty flat and just a quick hour and a half to San Francisco [noise]\nOne of those warehouses if Amazon\nI reach out to them to see if I can come take a look around and\nAnd visiting the facility\nGave me a sense of what the future of warehousing will actually look like at the commerce gross especially when it comes to increase automation [noise]\nAs I entered the building bears justice wall of turnstiles floor to ceiling kind that you see in the New York city subway\nAnd there are signs everywhere and said no photo\nOnce the guard left me and I really have to break time\nTons of employees are streaming out through the airport security style scanners they have\nUnder Williamsburg\nWe also have way more than eight hundred full time\nI get a tour of the facility from Danny to four yeah who introduced herself as a community specialist I'm not sure what that means [noise]\nIn fact there's a lot of Amazon specific language I hear on my tour Amazon calls are warehouses fulfillment centers they call all their workers associate entry level jobs are known as tier one and over and over again I keep hearing the phrase fulfilling our customer prompted for\nWalking around there or stop signs and a lot of places\nHopefully we'll be another one in a minute we call them ADD aging\nThese automatic guided vehicle\nBasically it's like a forklift loaded up with item but it's totally a man and it follows enough of the warehouse for programmed into it\nIt just wishes by us\nEverything\nIn this warehouse is yellow and gray except for another kind of robot that works here they're bright orange\nWhen you think of robots as isn't always but people have in mind this is Lauren\nLynch who does communications for Amazon they're not person shaped robots more like big orange room but they're square and on top of each of them is just out of shelves which holds item operate in\nThe so this is how it\nWorks they somebody really wants to order a back when they get online\nOnce they do that that's one of the item gets ...\nYou're in a notice on screen provided the item\nThat cannot be items\nAnd then one it is how many they need\nTo pick the back massager a second worker calls the orange robots over retrieved massager shelf and then puts it on the yellow ...\nKind of like those airport security traits which go on a conveyor belt set in\nPlace that we're going to go and\nPopulation is what it sounds like basically the back massager comes in on the yellow tray and the worker pack into box no robots here\nThis is a place where someone just to see all the secrets of what we order online\nAnd today that someone is a very peppy ... what do you have a\nMachine\nI Want to know what is the weirdest combo of stuff she's seen someone order\nI asked her how many items does she have to pack a day\nWell I Know an hour they want us to do about it so\nYou could do that we work ... hours a day\nNormally do for ships there'll be so if you do the math actually packs around two thousand five hundred and twenty items a week\nSo the very last thing that happens to your back\nMagical puff of air label is created and generally play in the air on top of all\nThat sound the\nAir's sleeping an accident that make this part I have to admit it's literally my favorite [noise]\n\nUntil the robot Amazon pretty amazing and on the way and I pass signs of a mother's room and there are vending machines that I see two they're free to workers with items like earplugs lotion Advil just this week Amazon announced that they're raising their minimum hourly\nWage to Fifteen dollars but over the last few years Amazon has been grilled about their working conditions for example public records show that thousands of Amazon employees are on food stamps and bumped out these pickers are misleading because they include people who only worked there for a short period of time or worked part time\nAnd a book published this year by a reporter who worked undercover at an Amazon facility in the u._k. details that workers often wouldn't even take bathroom break because they feared not making work quota and\nThat workers were actually penalized for taking six days Amazon responded that they didn't recognize these allegations that's accurate they also said they coach people weren't making the quotas and that their attendance policy has changed these kinds of conditions are part of why employee turnover at Amazon is very high\nWhile I'm an Amazon I ask learn about the\nYou know we don't have power over light individuals may that decisions they make to stay in a career or a role for whatever period of time they choose to but we are able to do is provide a great word place with great team members and great benefit\nA consequence of so many workers turning in and out of warehouses is that it's really hard for them to push for their rights if they have concerns there are no unionized Amazon warehouses and the United states\nAmazon primarily believes in an open door policy we believe in the ability to talk directly with associates\nOpen door policy basically she's saying that they'd rather have employees talk to their managers that they have a problem than work with a union to voice concern\n[noise] [noise]\nSo without strong worker protection and in an ever shifting workforce are these the jobs that the graduates have Patterson high school really want I head down to Los Angeles to place reckoning with these questions\n[noise]\nPhotos of workers protesting on the other side [noise]\nThe center is one of the only

seven years after he dropped out of college to start helping his family his mom got sick and he helps out paying rent and bills the biggest problem for him though is the lack of consistent hours the Wayne doesn't work directly for the warehouse he worked for a temp agency\nAnd the agency is supposed to have him working at the warehouse forty hours a week but\nSometimes they don't want to be um [noise] sometimes they do last week dealing with me and one day so\nTwain sometimes lines up at five AM in the morning first shift at six AM after being called in and still get turned away sometimes

least worst friday like can you give me anyway as management there's and I just being out there in Texas I worked in a while you know yeah that is like a constant threat of that basically yeah\nAnd as for moving up and getting off the temp hamster wheel queen says he's never even seen a way to apply directly for full time job at the warehouse but he works that basically warehousing companies you temp agencies because it's cheaper\nTemp agencies provide a steady stream of labor to warehouse and I don't have to worry about recruiting workers or managing them\nThey take money out of each worker's hourly wage and joins us as a temp agency doesn't tell them how much it could be a dollar ten dollars they don't know and a lot of work or a steady paycheck makes workers less likely to speak up\nBecause they don't want to risk sacrificing the hours they do have ... he says he'd like to go back to school maybe become a writer but that's not his plan right now\nThe kind of news is going to school at the things that they as do I wish I didn't complain about ...
