each other uh what is the secret ingredient\nJust just be around women\nI you know from experience with the the really great environment you know it's so funny 'cause people I Would assume like the opposite ... you know how they brainwashed us in the past like catty women riding\nHis you know to get the competition yeah yeah I mean I feel like I mean you can find that anywhere really but I think I mean I always have found myself very comfortable in groups of women and and bases where it's like female run I mean I went to an all women's college\nBut this was definitely a progressive group and uh everyone really love being there and everybody was really excited to make something not unlike any other\nYeah and you know what I find very impressive and particularly admirable about you is that you are one hundred percent self made because growing up your parents and your brother were deported when you were just fourteen years old and were forced to basically fend for yourself\nHow did you manage [noise] [laughter] yeah\nYou know I think I had a very clear I'm\nAt a very young age but if that did happen I mean I did grow up with the fear of my family being separated that was always very present\nIn our household and so I was just always sort of like an outsider look looking in you know actually because I was the only one in the family who was documented who is a citizen so anyway I grew up very confused but\nI always had it I'm very clear in my mind that whatever happened that I was going to continue going and I was going to be strong and I was going to find a way to succeed and and that in ... I mean I didn't I didn't think oh I'm going to succeed as an actor or this or that I just wanted to succeed\nIn life I guess I just wanted to figure out a way to be happy and to um you know I figure I'll everything out and hopefully along the way help my family one day\nAnd in two thousand fourteen you wrote a very powerful op ed piece for the Los Angeles times about your brother your brother your parents deportation ha what was it about two thousand fourteen uh\nThat you decided it is now time for me to tell the story I ... I\nThought maybe my voice could be an asset\nYou're hot [laughter] I'm way because especially because of the people the people who are I was hearing like on the news on and on different talk shows really didn't when he talked about immigration it really didn't personal to me so I figured well how are these people representing my experience and the\nHe that easy it's not that we need to have better conversation about this and then I I decided okay I'll write something and see if can move the needle in any way\nAnd what was the aftermath once that was published\nIt was it was like cats at a bag and I had to do all this work [laughter]\n\nSo I'm like I'm tired I'm like ... and I'm like nobody wants to give them your job [laughter] you know let them you know some drug dealers girlfriend\nOn [noise] and and here I Am putting\nMyself in it that you know do all this work on top of this work\nYeah and it also led to obviously you deciding to write a book a whole memoir based on your life yeah called in the country we love my family divided\nAnd now you not only have this book but you've decided to publish it well being published your latest book is targeted towards a young adult audience yeah ... it is called my family divided one girl journey of home last and hope what is different about this version\nUm it's just like an easier read like easier than already that easy book um money people come up to me all the time it's\nLike your book I read it in one sitting it's easier\nI I uh I gave her younger students [laughter]\nThose are the students that have been responding to the story so I wrote it for them really it wasn't intended for you an adult\nTime [noise] so yeah that's why you found it easy\n[laughter] and now this memoir your story is being developed as a television series well\nTrying okay I'm In talks right now a developing on either theories or found um I can take in many different directions that sort of like when I'm getting into right now animated series on ...\nYeah yeah I Want to make it into a children's book actually I'm very interested in that and then you know [laughter] or or the explorer do\n[laughter]\nYou don't do that my family [noise]\nShe'll be like [noise] the families\nAllowed ...
