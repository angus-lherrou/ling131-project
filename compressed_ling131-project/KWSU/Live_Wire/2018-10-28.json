for his portrayal of sponge Bob square pants on Broadway we'd love to eat then later\nThank you for having me so exciting to have you here so let's start from the beginning of your spongebob journey yes verify with me when you were and what you were doing when you received the information that you had an audition for sponge Bob square pants\nWas I remember very clearly I was in my friends\nI don't know if you remember that was our mascot\nAnd uh I was sitting on a bean bag chair in a dorm room and like a like across from me with my friends poster of all the faces that spongebob makes all those wacky faces and then he had a\nPlush sponge Bob Dole kid I wasn't that lived on that being back here so I was like sitting next to it and I got a phone call and it was a casting director who had just seen me audition for Romeo and Juliet really randomly as part of an apprenticeship that I wanted to work out for the summer\nAnd they said we have this audition for you can't tell you what it is technically it's the entitled to no end up project but we think you might be the right shape for it\nYeah that hurt I Want her a little bit but [noise]\nGotten over it but you know what\nThey were talking about it oh no they they said the the name of chipper chip and just we're going to send you a follow up email so I went back in the dorm was like God I got this audition how cool is going to be in and like there's like this little picture in the email of spongebob doing the Han\nLike looked at the ... and I looked at the poster I looked at my friends and I'm like oh chipper chip is sponge Bob\nI'm that is a crazy coincidence it was it was really wild you go to the audition and you decide you're not going to do a sponge Bob impression is very distinctive\nHigh pitched kind of gig leave voice but you're not going to do that you're just going to use your voice right yeah that was like both I'm a conscious decision yes an artist and also\nA choice that I made out of fear and eight hours of preparation time sure ah I had never tried to do a sponge Bob impression I had a lot of friends who were great at doing the laugh yeah and that was not me so I stayed up you know working on my physical comedy routine until four in the morning on the quad\nAnd I just sort of like did the whole thing like this just like eat them but like a little bit more excited and um and the addition went pretty well but as I remember it Tina Landau the director at the end with like a great job awesome come back in and do the voice it's pretty important [laughter]\nCool for cocoa\nYes you said you were you were sitting at Vassar you're sitting drama you yeah you got this apprenticeship for Romeo and Juliet did you know yeah I was actually cast in in the show or in addition to the apprenticeship which was like a huge for me it was like going to be my first professional gig yeah\nAnd I can imagine 'cause they were like well you got you know two weeks of this workshop or a full production of Shakespeare and I was like well I've been doing plays and I really love Shakespeare I I've been doing to Shakespeare show since I was a little kid in DC and so that that was something that I'd always wanted to do and I talk to my professor\nAt the time and he said Shakespeare will always be there but if you pass up the opportunity to work with Tina land out you're going to regret it so I think Tina for being the reason that I chose the obvious pass [laughter]\nI Love the Shakespeare is always going to be there but spongebob is here right now right\nRight now his moments so this show is incredibly physical I mean you are doing gymnastics you were jumping in the air for what seems like over half of that show I mean it's intense\nSo what kind of training did you go through a there was a lot of training it's this five years you've been where he has shown up I'm sick\nYeah but yeah I I've learned so many skills over the course of the six years I I learned things like juggling first team that got cut and um I learned a great which are right now I can juggle place for that sort of cool wow um yeah and and you know I went to train with contortion us for six months um yeah and yeah\nWhen you see the show you do this incredible back band that makes everyone gas\nYeah I'd say that I think your bank you to a you know Jonathan notes and yeah my contortion teacher I mean they have I was really aware of the demands going into it and I didn't want to not be ready yeah oh yeah it was a lot\nAnd you mentioned that playing spongebob has actually affected your outlook on life it is made you a more optimistic person totally\nTotally yeah I mean it's hard not to I I mean I I have the privilege of you know being the sponge to an age shows a week [noise] um when did you first notice that [noise]\nI don't know it's been a gradual increase yeah um I think I only started to acknowledge it when people started asking me if I feel like a lot like sponge Bob yes and like at first I was like [noise] no [noise]\nUm but yeah I mean like\nI'm really proud that I Do because I think that shockingly spongebob has these qualities that I aspire to he he's ... he's like a little naive maybe but he's he's very optimistic and he's able to put his love of his friends end up his community\nTo be taken over by their fear and buy their hatred and their ability to scapegoat others and what ... bothered able to do is say no I'm not going to do that I Love my community and I love these people\nNot going to let this town destroy itself you know I get to save the world from itself every night and that's like especially these days [laughter] [noise] uh that feels really like\nHi how\nAre you ready for an asked me another challenge yes I Am a fantastic of course you are so even we actually found a pretty amazing opponent for you please welcome the Tony nominated book writer a sponge Bob square pants the musical Kyle Jericho every body\n\nKyle thanks for being on the show as well happy to have you ... okay so you you wrote the book how many years did you have you been working on this project I\nThink I've been involved almost six years okay yeah here's\nWhat is the evolution of the story of sponge Bob square pants the musical what are the evolution of the story has\nA change from day one yeah it has I mean we knew okay here's the challenge writes butter on my TV they're eleven minute episode yes a Broadway show you maybe where nine eleven minutes long just a little on just a little longer so we had to figure out like how do we take that\nCrazy fast paced show and create a show that can fill in the evening and has a kind of steak\nThe emotional states that are going to make us want to sit there for an evening\nSo pretty early we sat on the idea there was going to be the end of the world which are pretty high stakes yet right great time and then the exact a version of end of the world's changed a bunch\nBut we were kind of always on that idea that it was going to be Armageddon meat sponge Bob\nSponge Bob in his fellow inhabitants of bikini bottom or threatened by a volcano that it's going to destroy it and people are freaking out they looked at each fish are perfectly fish fish are free\nTo clarify the I just saw myself at every single one of those fish and they had a squirrel ... who is who is a mammal and there is a subtle thing where everyone ends up turning on the mammal and even spray paint a sign that says mammals go home\nWhich of course it seems like a comment on the current world around us and I'm just wondering when did this entered the script\nKnow interestingly enough it's been in there a long time in the show Sandy this world is the only land mammal right there are aquatic\nSo anyway we always thought wrote a story about people turning against each other dealing with fear the idea of scapegoating somebody it just you know that's what happened yes so she as the outsider seemed like you know really clear way to tell that story sadly the world has really caught up and I think it's felt even more\nRelevant than it did even when we did in Chicago a couple of years ago right art art imitating reality\nUh so we have a game for you eaten in Kyle your game is called take a sad song and make it better [laughter] and to perform your clues I Would like to welcome Tony Award nominee for the music of
