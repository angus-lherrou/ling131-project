have the bulldog I tried to interview him many times\nYeah so um but I Know I think you have to go shelters have tapped to be kept but I think personally I feel a a sigh of relief because I think you know things could have been much worse and so if we have and kind of I Try to territory here with this with this president\nIn fact the liberals are kind of calling it to the it could have been a lot worse deals so what is really different from NASA because this is what's being criticized as that well what it'd be really get what it really can come out of this they said it would be when when when

of like oh my God this is amazing history like now and then um we both you know if he got up and and we did our kids knowing that they would not be awake um and my brother my sister\nThan I thought you know [laughter] I I think I should get draft I don't know like I thought maybe I should get some food it before I have to do this press conference\nOr that's wild ... must be the craziest day for us to because you you're working your way you do every day you're getting up you're just you're pushing that ball up the hill and then this comes along that have\n... ... exactly it's right out of ...\nAnd now it can be so if it's a big congratulations to you\nFive years is that is amazing I did did you know that before you you learned\nA lot I guess I had never really thought about it you know

one on the one before that was ... ... yes of course so\nI can really be you know I shouldn't be lined up with those two incredible women but anyway\nWell you are [laughter] [laughter]\nSo I Will have\nBut you know it's interesting that we we spoke last month's with astrophysicist Jocelyn Bel Bruno and she told us about being overlooked for a Nobel Prize she was she was one of the well a group of men and she was the only woman to an end to develop this research and posters the men won the Nobel\nAnd she used to be when the press came to ask questions they asked the men about the science and they asked her\nAbout her measurements and her bra size and she had any boyfriends isn't in the late Nineteen sixty she was a scientist at that point did you ... did you experience sexism and in science and of course of your career\nNot blatantly no I mean you know along the way you know I I've been told by you know men that I did better that you know and I've been bitten by a girl or you know how could a girl get that kind of mark you know that kind of silly thing but I just always think it's silly when they say\nWell you must have heard the Italian professor ... and at the certain conference\nI missed that I should find time to listen to it because I mean not asked to comment on it\nAnd we should listen he said it was invented by men and built by men and are becoming a nose turning against the men who invented it to your profession\nI say in ... and he just forgot to think about Marie Curie um you know I mean the fact of history that you know men did go to work and women stayed at home and so there were more men you know that's just that's just a fact I'm but obviously once you've never you know obviously there's people that are making contributions and they should all be recognized\nAs talk about what you should be recognized for which is tripped pulse vacation what is that in layman's terms or I should lay woman's terms\nIt's the fact that ah at the time when we were doing this work you could have shortfalls lasers or you could have high energy lasers but she couldn't have short pulse and high energy because of that peak power which he won in order to maybe blow up an Adam and stripped the electorate\nThem blow up your amplifier\nAnd so this is why it didn't happen and so what tripped pulse amplification did and it's a very simple concept is the fact that we realize now you have to ... the pulse first which means you stretch the pulse to be many you know orders of magnitude longer but then you can go ahead and amplify it because now it just seems like a long pulse of amplifier nothing happens to the amplifier\nAnd after that then you can ... it also does not destroy the um stretch that you put on it it maintains it and so you can go ahead and compress it back to the way it was except with all the energy and and now it's ready for the experiment\nBut that but that didn't layman's terms that's really how to get the shortfalls and high energy for the experiment but not inside the laser\nIs dramatically increased intensity of that post then that's right what what is it they will to do now that you were able to did you accomplish that what what would it applications is that\n[noise] well of course many of applications were scientific right so this is why we started to study just how molecules and atoms are ionized underneath the fields in a bigger than what's holding the electrons to the Adams inside later field and so this was a new sort of paradigm to work and\nIt was a very few years after it was invented that somebody actually commercialized a CPA laser for eye surgery\nAnd this was you know millions of people have had correct a laser eye surgeries\nBut they don't all have to they don't want to use it but millions house yes it is a huge is probably the number one application I still\nLook come on you must be proud of that\nYeah I mean and that's why I found it amazing that um it happened so quickly happened to them that yes\nAnd it's made a difference with so many lives that's what\nYou called you know what I Want you to do that no I Know that you pay the way the side of the way down there when I was going to be made I made it possible yes and ... and there's also a lot being made on Twitter that uh you know about winning scientist is an associate professor at water so when I I'm\nI'm very sorry to hear that I think the university has been criticized for that but I just something that for a flight\nYou know nobody told me not to know but you know actually I have colleagues male colleagues here telling me I should you know it was\nTime for me to be applying and I said you all get around to that but I just never did\nYou going to get on to it now\nI don't know my I kind of hoping maybe the University of lifting they'll just give it to me now [laughter] I don't know I guess if they have a lot of flak they'll they'll maybe helped me fill out all the forms that has to be folder\nFlashing Nobel winning scientist is probably a good enough reason to have become a full professor\nLike to do things that are ...\nThanks for speaking with us by surprise\nWe reached associate professor Dona Strickland in Waterloo, Ontario she won the Nobel Prize in physics today as colonel mentioned in my conversation they're professors strict ones Nobel comes on the heels of\nControversial comments spot Italian scientist all the songs that are still young enough to research organization CERN on friday a ... spoke at a seminar about gender issues in physics\nHe claimed as Carroll said the physics was quote invented and built by men it's not by invitation unquote\nHe also said male scientist were being discriminated against because of ideology rather than merit CERN has issued a statement saying Mr ... Romeo was immediately suspended for his quote unacceptable remarks\nJust Wade is a physicist from imperial college London she attended that seminar we reached him as Wade in London\nBecause we had what was the most offensive thing you heard listening to professor ... speaking the other day\nI think that a nice defense if part of the total is to say that says it was invented by ... and it's not by invitation when I meet women has contributed hugely Pacific throughout the whole of history\nThat friend incredibly long time we haven't documented auto stories and we have to be ready castle and you have to remember that it with any midway through the last three that women were even able that graduate from ready prestigious universities like Harvard or Cambridge and so that kind of huge impact on physics has only just the getting sock and now\nIt wasn't just some off the cuff remark that this professor made and that question period this was he gave a series of slides discussing his ... can you describe some of the some of the presentation he gave I Know you were in the room for that\nThat presentation had obviously had a lot of time taking over it and he had done a bake analysis of lots of publications and looked at the track record of men and women comparing that kind of time throughout that gray and showing at the beginning of all ... they have a number of citations but different publications\nAnd then afterwards is deviated changed the man had more citations\nAnd that's actually a huge number of programs and the whole way of academic publishing at the moment that's a big bias against women and they'll say against on west and people in the fast ferry stages of terror of you and then after that that by an ... site and you basically when you're writing out to find\nAnd more often than not with men men and they find men more often that she also fight themselves way more often than they cite women so I see that all of these missiles sneaky by says but the creeping in to make that data no rights and ... is a metric to buy it at that at the\nEnd he said this was not uses his ... his opinion or biased you said this is he was proving this with his research that to some physics is not sexist against women however the truth does matter because it is part of a political battle coming from outside what would you referring to there\nAgain but not just defense language test a values test to immigrants and that's about to have be having\nAs a federal government to do it for your time we actually\nYou know we never said that we would ask the federal government to do that reality is what we were proposing is that and it's just something that exists even if we're within Canada that people who emigrated here are asked to adhere to Canadian values in general and that's the only thing that we were suggesting so\nWe're not doing anything more or less than what the federal government doing on its\nOwn and they all know where where is there a test anywhere else in Canada for your values ... tell me when that happens\nImmigrants that want to come to Quebec are off a series of questions about how life occurs everyday in Canada and our our position is very similar to that and we're asking them to adhere to basic values\nOf a of Canada whether or not it's a quality of the sexes hum are you know a same sex marriage rights very basic things I think anybody who wants to come to Canada should know that this is a place\nThat welcomes diversity and that's basically what the question that would involve anybody who uh wouldn't hypothetically positive I think that would be extremely rare considering anybody who wants to come here is manifestly wants to integrate within our society at that point we would simply say that we don't we will admit the\nCredential that's required Ottawa at that point a could could walk to limit welcome them anywhere and of course the charter breakfast freedoms would apply so I'm not overly concerned with that position and I don't find it took street and I don't think that we're anywhere near the deporting and I think it's you know I don't think it's accurate to say that we can do that because provincial governments don't have the power\nTo just to make the class size is what we've heard some seek you is it there would be and this past would happen several years after they arrived to see how they would have been degraded land languages that not too\nSlowly ... that were very welcoming to immigrants and we want them to succeed him are going to be very flexible\nAnd the way that we in dispel the circus is such a certificates and of course right now we're in the process of forming are cabinet the premier elect is looking into forming a his team and I think you know the new immigration minister is going to have the responsibility of clarifying exact rules but I mean I don't think that now is a good time to get into the details as\nTo what that would look like the future immigration minister is going to consult with about their crotch within the immigration department consult with our federal partners to make sure that we have some good but\nTo be cleared the seat wants integration to see a cue wants immigrants to succeed and we want to throw more money at making sure that they do succeed so actually I think our position is very open minded and I think it's in tune with what we represent\nAbout wearing religious symbols what restrictions ... understanding the party would not want people in the in the public servants teachers to be wearing a overt religious symbols and not the case\nMission was a commission that occurred ten years ago within that report it was determined that the best way to proceed would be to prohibit overt religious symbols in positions of authority so anybody who was it in a position to exercise the power of the state would be required\nTo a knock where over religious symbols and see a cue believes that teachers in primary and high school are authority figures\nThat religious neutrality law is already in the subject of a constitutional challenge and so is the ... going to go further than that religious new talent you know\nWe're gonna have to see where that goes but I'm not going to speculate as to what we may or may not do with something that's currently been part of the courts\nWould that I can also be those religious symbols it includes people who end crucifix is\nAnything that would be overt and religiously significant would be something that would be covered by the Bush are Taylor commission\nThis is an election for the first time in years and that that was not focused on top and he said what does that tell you about ... students I was in\nI think it tells us that we finally moved on and I think that's a great thing you know for me uh I've been stuck in a in a world where are we have two choices I had a party that wanted to stay within Canada and I had one that wants to separate from Canada
