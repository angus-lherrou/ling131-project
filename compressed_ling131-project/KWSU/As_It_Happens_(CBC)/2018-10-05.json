back with a number of other journalists\nTo a demand has release my understanding is that um she is a not well over the situation\nBut again and there are there have been reports of of journalists that have been gathering particularly the Turkish Arab journalists coalition that is gathering to um to pressure and and demand answers basically\nIs there any chance that he could have left and she didn't know about it\nUm I I'm sure that it is and what is best when what's on all of our minds of right now obviously I'm the Saudi authorities are maintaining that he left the conflicts and ah the latest statement and the thing that they're cooperating with Turkish authorities\nTo try to find him on the Turkish official position from the presidential spokesperson is that they have reason to believe that he is still there\nWith all constantly since the local authorities who provides a police force in the country is in ... the the host country\nSecurity cameras and did not see Mr ... will be leave the building on foot but they do say that a number of diplomatic cars had been moving in and out of the conflict since Tuesday so it is that where your concerns why\nI'm sure I think there's that and then there are just the concerns that frankly that we're hearing very very different and conflicting theories and explanations from the Saudis and the Turkish authorities\nAnd from our efforts at the at the post you know we really we have reached out to both um Saturday in Turkish authorities so we hope that uh the Turks can\nPressure their study counterparts for information and for answers I'm I'm sure in an ideal situation a there are CCTV CCTV cameras and then you know show us the tapes if if the Saudis are saying is true that a ... I'm actually to leave then there should be evidence of that\nWhy would Saudi Arabia take him I wouldn't be detained democracy will be\nSomeone who's worked with them and in fact I just saw him\nA few weeks ago here in Washington where he's been living for about the past year or so\nYeah it's been critical of the Saudi Government and in particular the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman obviously this is all happening against the backdrop of a wave of crackdowns a dissent in Saudi Arabia\nA just a few days ago some of them out of the economist was I'm charged with a terrorism after being detained for nearly a year as well um women activists plenty of other journalists and clerics\nI'm so this is a singer malls and mystery surrounding demolish happening against this this backdrop and um you know we were publishing Lawrence's pieces in Arabic and I I Do know that that ah it's something that the Saudi authorities are sensitive to 'em\nBut again I think what Jamal always told me that he did not want to be labeled as a\nDissident or as a an opposition journalist he really just wanted to write and often a lot of his his work was even advising Mohammed bin Salman\nAbout here's what I think you should do we forget that Jamal was a it was formally over a royal family advisor at one point um\nSo uh it is it is really you know quite stunning I'm quite studying to see what's been happening in the kingdom in general just sitting there and tolerance for dissent and could make Jamal target absolutely\nYou point out he was formerly he was an advisor to the royal family so what what ... what changed\nIn the very first piece that I I commissioned an edited for him last September\nAnd the title was back in Saudi Arabia was always repressive now it's becoming unbearable\nUm he basically just saw a lot of his friends getting swept up in the crackdown seesaw friends I'm being imprisoned or having travel bans a slapped on them and that the time you know he he wrote out in that area we deserve better than less and this is again I came to him that is showing even under this new conference\nTotal and tolerance for any sort of a descent or or criticism of their policy\nWe know what it is Mohammed bin Salman is consolidated his power he has this report had arrested\nHundreds of clerics active as business people numbers of them were detained outside the country what became of them is there any record of people getting released is there is there a pattern that you might be able to give you hope that you know show gave my my to emerge from this city is being detained by the side\nAnd that's that's the difficult part again we know of activists and and journalists and social media stars that\nHave been held for months a year even before being a before being charged with anything so yes I'm very worried but again it's just very hopeful that keeping in a spotlight on his name and on this case both scare us and abroad can can help for speedy resolution\nAll right we'll be watching herons thank you thank you so so much\nCarnitine is the Washington Post global opinion editor we reached her in Washington DC\n\n\nIf you go into battle with Dell material either you're going to end up wobbling down your arms or she will almost certainly\nIn her weight clashes ranked second in Canada with her right arm third with our left\nLater this month she was going to be taken both those arms to turkey where she will compete against athletes from forty five other countries that the world I'm wrestling championships we reached I'm a kill him beach Berg Ontario\nUm uh did you inherit cheered talent for arm wrestling I did for sure who did you get it from\nI got it from both my parents and my grandma\nAnd they were good at arm wrestling they were amazing anonymous [laughter] did you wrestle them\nWell not my grandma but my dad and my mom [laughter] definitely\nAnd did they usually win well yeah [laughter] it's more of a respect thing for me when did you start when did you start to smoke them\nUm well I said to smoke my mom uh probably around the age of Eighteen and my dad well the Yankees rarely hurt him\n[laughter] too good to practice with your dad exactly and what about the grandmother viewers\nOh she's still Brooklyn at her age\nHow old is she no\nShe just and their seventies ah them to be honest I I'd rather live better age\n[laughter] I'm I'm you're you're not wrestling or because you're afraid to\nYes [laughter]\nSo you okay so obviously it comes in with your new inherited but when did you first get interested in competition and arm wrestling\nAbout Fifteen Years old actually\nHow does that come about\nMy dad and I said well and my mom we were invited on this um was Alan hit men for he is doing a fundraiser for himself and he said I Will give off camera whoever can beat me\nAnd I'd like well free camera right so we went in and my dad on the camera and they offered by parents to go and train them\nBut they didn't really know much about myself but I wanted to give it a shot so my dad got me into the practice and they saw a lot of potential and they're like you know what Fifteen Years old and your polling this much do you want to continue with this\nWhat did you think that when they told her that\nIt really was um something huge for me I never really had something as big as this for someone to actually take initiative and me is just a a very light in the dark cold basically\nWhat about why was the whole dark I mean\nAnd I never really liked it because you know dress it didn't fit right church didn't look good\nI was a world they kid and I just absolutely hated my act but then when they said that your strength look at the size of your arms and you're gonna be amazing I actually got a a confidence boost to continue\nAnd we heard that Ralph go down a public safety and his minister while ago he said the government would look\nTo ways to make things fair and all that that that did you think the liberals are supporting your private members bill\nGoing to find out because I intend to ask them on October seventeenth but honestly I Do hope they do and this was not a\nThey could have done and should have done when they introduced the kind of his building the first place California brought in similar measures Vermont did but I kept that they're not saying let's wait until the bill comes into force and so I'm trying to use this private members built it as an effort to kind of nudge them to do the right thing I'm hopefully will\nBut if it seems likely that they are going to do what you're proposing then why not just wait for that why why make this noise now when it's likely just going to evolve in that direction anyway\nWell maybe you're more optimistic than I Am certainly talked about this and vague terms I Want to commit them to build this bill is gone through several drafts with the same kind of legislative draft or who have worked for the government and I'm hoping they'll say this is it if they want to tweak it if they want to improve it and run with it\nNothing would make me happier but I Do not want this to simply linger it seems to me an issue that needs to be addressed because we're imposing burdens on hundreds of thousands of Canadians that simply should not have them going forward\nI recall that Stephen Harper government imposed a mandatory minimum sentences and six months\nFor uh any pot possession of snakes plans or less a witch hunt understand the number of people were affected by that we've spoken billions and you know that while ago who is a minister and that cabinet too was supported those mandatory minimum sentences he's now\nIn the business he says that pot has a wonderful therapy for people and it's a great business opportunity what do you say to those who supported this in the past and now see it as an opportunity for them\nWell I'm not going to comment on business decisions that they made and what some would say as a slightly hypocritical position I understand that what you're suggesting but truly this has to be something that the liberals and conservatives support this is something that we should all pass ideally by unanimous resolution if possible\nSo we can write this injustice going forward\nYou think that conservatives will support your bill\nYou know I've talked to a couple of them on the culture of the justice committee sort of dealing with the right people and uh I've talked to one so far and\nI Hope that they will I think they get the basic point about the injustice and I'm hoping like me that they see that society has changed and things that might have been treated one way back twenty Thirty years ago is treated in a very different way today we've seen that all over the place in other areas\nSame sex activity there was an expungement bill of as you know in the last parliament that dealt with that and those people who had convictions for that activity I think although very different this approach is very analogous\nAll right we'll be watching this bank and thank you thank you Murray rank and in the ... justice critic we reached him in Ottawa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe had been raped and this infuriated a mob of angry whites\nWho were determined to take matters into their own hands lynchings were all too common in Tulsa Dick rolling was arrested and whites began to gather in front of the courthouse angry and upset about what had happened about forty black man approached the court house initially and spoke with the sheriff\nAt that time and offered to help protect a growing he told them to go back to ... that he had everything under control and the problem would be fine so they did return to Greenwood but some estimates habit\nThat there were as many as ten thousand whites that had gathered in front of the court house last jailhouse later that evening angry and upset determined to take medicine to their own hands and a group of about a one hundred black men returned\nAnd this time a white man approached a black man with a gun and so what are you going to do with that gone he said I'm going to use it if I have to and they begin to struggle over the gun and during the struggle to gun goes off\nAnd at that point they forget all about ... page there's an all out battle in front of the courthouse blast retreat to the Greenwood district\nAnd whites slowly advance towards the Greenwood district eventually breaking through the barriers that African Americans had set up protecting their community but\nBecause they were so outnumbered and out gun eventually whites are able to overtake the blacks and invade their community and when they do so they invade um Killeen looting stealing and\nWithin a short day by the following day more than thirty five square blocks of property has been completely destroyed a thousand homes burned to the ground three hundred black on homes up three hundred black owned businesses completely destroy and not only were they were shooting but they were also dropping\nNitroglycerine bombs from airplanes that had been borrowed from a local oil company\nAnd this has been described in two thousand and one report by the Oklahoma commission to study closer race riots and is that this was probably the only time that the United states has anybody community than bombs from the air\nThat is correct what do we know about what happened to those those those those remains\nFor what we know is that the entire\nPopulation of the African American community was ten to twelve thousand six thousand of those people were held in internment camps um\nThat left four to six thousand people on accounted for and we know that there were people that flat so there's no way of knowing exactly how many people lost their lives but we do believe that um the number is even higher than the three hundred that has been recognized\nWe do not know that there were several mass grave sites that were\nOur uh survivors we identified a hundred and sixty two survivors in Nineteen Ninety six that began telling their stories but also from whites that want it to call and speak anonymously about the dump trucks that would drive through the streets of the Greenwood district pick up dead bodies and then go dump them in the Arkansas River\nWe know that there was a mass grave site in Oakland cemetery based on the testimony of a man who happened to be a young boy at the time that the riot took place and he was playing in the area when he saw a group of white men\nPiling bodies into an open plot at oak lawn cemetery and\nWe did some preliminary investigative work there um years ago and\nThat geophysical search I'm determined that there was a mass grave site that there was a reason to believe that there was a mass grave fight when we were not given permission to do the archaeological work\nThat needs to be done um and so we're hoping with this new decision that I'm from the mayor to move forward with that investigation that we will finally be able to do a thorough and very complete investigation at least with Oakland cemetery we are almost positive that we will find a mass grave fight there\nI was reading some of the comments that were on the Facebook page of the mayor and they're making the statement that this is he's the he's giving the green light for this investigation to happen", "show_name": "As It Happens
