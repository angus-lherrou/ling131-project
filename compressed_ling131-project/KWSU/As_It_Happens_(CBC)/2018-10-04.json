will not forget\nCan you I Know this sense is is paying for that you've spoken about it I'm a great deal I just want to know if you take us back to what you understand happened that night in September two thousand and final\n[laughter] well what happened was this lady who had been our son's friends on ... for two months only she decided to take our son's life and it was only after a lot of meticulous planning\nA period of time along well let's start with other people that she said the plan and then next year the plan\nIt was supposed to appear as though a robbery that had gone bad\nYes that was supposed to have\nBeen the parents and in fact during the middle of the the assault she actually talked to the murder and reminded him that he should get her clients on a list of the other cheek so that you could appear to be in that she was involved\n\nUm [noise]\nThe current US President tends to repeat himself and one of the things that he has repeated over and over and over again is how he is a quote self made billionaire [noise]\nWell a New York times investigation offers a somewhat different perspective it reveals that Mr Trump received four hundred and Thirteen million US dollars from his father's real estate empire most of it because he helped his family dodge taxes [noise]\nTwo years ago reporters Suzanne Craig a Canadian was mailed to Mr Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax returns\nShe told us he had possibly avoid paying federal taxes for Eighteen years but now the times is reporting that Mr Trump participated in outright fraud we reached Suzanne Craig in New York City\nSuzanne you put out a trade or what do you up to last night 'cause you\nFinished at work I went out to a depressed New York times press plant in Queens and I watch the uh the story that we wrote roll off the process\nSo we last time we spoke a couple of years ago you received a brown paper ... in which you had a part of Donald Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax return and from that you were able to extrapolate a lot of information but since then\nYou have found other streams of documents to describe what you would not during the past two years what you have an earth since then\nSure we continue to look at 'em Donald Trump's taxes after the story that we wrote in\nTwo thousand and sixteen where we got three pages of his tax returns right before election day um and we just continue to push on his fine out says part of that we examined tens of thousands of public documents and we also got access to thousands and thousands of confidential documents from Fred Trump's real estate empire\nYou tend to questions to Donald Trump is lawyer Charles Harder responded that should the times stage or implied that President Trump participated in fodder tax evasion or any of the crime it will expose you to buy ability and damages for defamation so I Know the language is careful here and is in the article how would you characterize\nThe charges you're putting out here concerning Donald Trump is family and their families empire\nWell we found it in terms of the the the wrong doing we found several instances based on the documents that we looked out where a Donald Trump participated in fraudulent talks keep\nGetting into some examples of if you are now we just say for instance can we talk about what happens when they do in huge numbers of loans that Donald Trump proceeds from his father had grown to into the millions of dollars how did he covered for those\nDonald Trump has long claimed as part of of this this\nNarrative that his credit for himself that he sort of but pretty much up from golfing businessman who made it to the president he was like a self made billionaire and and we found not only did\nWe we uncovered in the document start only at least sixty one million dollars in loans that uh the tropics tended to Donald Trump or cases many of them were repaid we also found that Donald Trump received over ... ... more than ... and beyond also as an inheritance more than four hundred million dollars from his father\nSaid trumping is his father and there's one instance you give that the fed tramp at one point and spent about fifty million dollars to buy a stake in at ... palace how how did he then and then sold it back to his son can you describe that\nFifteen million dollars and not that debt I'm instead of being a you know written off was in fact he used it to invest in the Trump power so he turned the debt into an investment in Trump powerless and then it was written down to almost nothing\nYou mentioned companies the old county building supply maintenance can you tell us what that was\nSure that was one of the most intriguing a frog that we found it was probably the most kind of ones but the bright lights around that is Fred Trump was getting older and to his eighties he he'd only not only you know huge number of buildings in the New York area\nWorth hundreds of millions of dollars but he was also sitting on a huge amount of cash\nAnd Donald Trump ... siblings realized that\nAt some point he was going to die and not money was going to be subject to fifty five percent inheritance talks to what the Trump ... kids that it's it's pretty incredible for years for Trump would\nYou know for his buildings he would buy everything from bridges and so and then one day\nA company called ... county was created and suddenly all county started doing all the buying for fried Trump's empire they would pay three hundred dollars for new fridge is but then they would create a separate receipt and they would mark it up anywhere from twenty to fifty percent and send it up to Fred and the difference on not\nWas pocketed by county which\nWas controlled by Donald Trump and his siblings it ... it allowed them to drain huge amounts millions of dollars in cash from their fathers empire so that it would not be subject to the death tax\nIs finally the kind of an overarching a theme of this investigation is that\nThat Donald Trump is presented this understood to have been a self made man but why why does it matter what is that in my way does it fit into the story about tried as to how Donald Trump benefited profited from that and the solidarity\nWell he's he's benefitted greatly over the years from this this law that has been repeated over and over and over and\nI guess just the myth making of him that's been wrong and it's a spectacular caught\nIt was interesting as we were going through the reporting early on in the Nineteen seventies right out you know when he graduates if he goes to work for his father he does an interview with the New York times and he goes around and he he talks about this job that's his and and this building that says\nAnd he's driving around in a car and he's you know showing this reporter all this stuff and it was incredible every\nEvery building he showed the reporter was his father's even though he claimed it was his own as his life went on he then\nStarted to diminish his father's achievements you know he would say\nTime in two thousand and four or five years after fried Trump staff to sell the empire the biggest single payday in his life in two thousand and four was done very quietly\nAnd just finally what was that final payday\nDot year it was just under two hundred million dollars he got roughly like a hundred and Seventy seven million\nThe empire itself sold for roughly eight hundred million in and we found through other records that it should have been valued at roughly a billion so even on that day the man who wrote the art of the deal you know I think got less than a lot less than he probably should have for sale\nAnd thank you very much thinking okay great thank you\nBye Suzanne Craig is the New York times reporter responding to the times investigations states taxation authority in New York City would review the allegations and his quote\nVigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation there is more on this story on our website CBC dot CA slash a I H\n\nIn most parts of the country is early autumn but in parts of Alberta you would be forgiven for mistaking it for the next season [noise]\nYesterday instead of pleasant multi colored leaves snow fell in areas around Calgary a lot of snow as much as sixty centimeters of snow if you were inside sipping tea it was not welcome but otherwise not a huge deal\nIf you were on the roads [noise] it was a nightmare on one highway hundreds of motorists were stuck for hours stretching into the night\nTrumpet player ... Linda ... was one of them and after a while he decided to get out of his car and serenade his fellow stranded motorist we reached Mr ... Linden in Calgary\nEnds when did you realize yes today that you are well and truly stuck on the road\n[laughter] well I looked ahead and I saw a bunch of are truckers what their flashers on it became a dead stop pretty much in the middle of nowhere and neither lane was moving left or right adequate look around one of those semi rigs and I could see cars as far as you could possibly\n... and so what time of the day that did this did you get stuck to not move again what time was that\nOh I was a leisurely drive back I a hit the the actual car rolled walk at about ... am I and that's when we can't go full stop\nHow long were you as well uh I was out there for ten and a half hours and hadn't moved an inch nobody had there were literally hundreds but probably a thousand cards easily\nLike couldn't you just turn around and head back\nWell this is a very wide Meridian in between it's sort of a grassy knoll which was completely and pique we covered it snow in fact at one point a number of hours in there was a brave SUV driver who literally launched his vehicle into the into the ditch and he had enough power to slide about two hundred meters beach finally got um the other side\nThere was actually a lot of applause from people who were staring watching this maybe I'd try it but he pulled it off and not one of the person the or do it\nAnd it's an area that has a chance\nOfficials that the water we don't know really uh how much fishes there and we suspect that there is not a lot but they're all doing really is something and it's probably our Todd and Arctic cottages younger painting all the pretty much the entire Arctic ecosystem CEOs whales\nOverbearing directly you know it depends on the Arctic God for the food source\nAnd it's a very oily fish it would lend itself\nVery well to what's referred to as a reduction fishery\nOr were you catch this issue a turn of the century into into a meal paddle fish milk product and you know there's a demand for that uh the central Arctic ocean has only eight to distract you buy into it was only eight thousand miles from courts and so these Asia\nSo it's you know it is accessible and I said I and many of these cases\nInsurance then be prosecuted economically\nBut they can't be prosecuted sustainable and I think that's the hard central Arctic ocean stands right now\nI understand you correctly and then these countries who have designed around the Arctic five is they call them kind of Norway Russia Denmark and the United states they fishing nations Iceland Japan South Korea China European Union they've all signed onto this\nFor sixteen years is march I Am but they're looking at some pretty rich fish stuck in there that they want to get their hands on so I I you're saying that you can imagine that will be anytime when you could stay here but he finished there so what happens is the end of sixteen years and they say okay you've had your way and now we're getting in there\nWell I don't know that it can never have a I don't think you can happen right now and I don't think it can happen in foreseeable future nevertheless there is a mechanism for renewal four and five year increments it will not\nBe renewed only if somebody puts up their hands so to speak and says we want to end this agreement you know I think that you before we go too far into the future speculate on what might happen\nI I think the important thing here today is to is to you know reflect on the fact that this actually happened right now which is just so impressed I still can't really believe that because ... years not so much that people would go there today because there is a as a commercially viable stock\nPeople have a tendency sometimes state so pushing companies to gold places the sacred ground\nYou know what I'm saying that I was there so when the time comes I have to be at the table to have my piece of the pie\nA and that's been prevented here now\nAll right well it could be interesting to watch what happens in the central Arctic ocean that thank you very much for telling us about Mr Tanner thank you very much for your interest\n[noise]\n\n\n\nTwenty years ago ... stone was a teenager living in British Columbia she wanted to make some money on so she began working sale set a call center pretty quickly Mr and get the feeling it was a scam she went to the police she confronted her boss nothing changed\nEventually however officials did get back in touch with her and this year stone was a witness I had a trial in uh Los Angeles federal court and that trial ended in the jury convicting a Canadian Man her former boss of male and wire fraud\nA press release said he had to quote orchestrated a bogus telemarketing scheme that the front of at least sixty thousand victims over Eighteen million dollars\nJak ones don't spoke with the CBC in British Columbia about how she started working a job all those years ago\nBunch of my friends were hired at a telemarketing room and they were offered a lot of cash bonuses for word got around really quickly amongst our friends um if I went and got a job there and we were basically hired to call people and offer them credit card fraud protection\nIt became very clear pretty quickly that we were only calling senior citizens we were only calling people in the United states ah we were instructed to lie to them about where we were located um and we were ... they were basically\nThan ripping off their credit card and we didn't know but it it started to become pretty clear so I did I still wanted to make the money\nSo I Would call these people and then I Would want them um to check out the company's name and make sure they do their research before giving their credit card number to anybody on the phone so I think the time and um\nI don't know I I was just I was so upset about it and I really wanted I wanted action at I Want to justice so\nI went down to the police station and I reported that\nUm gave them as much information as I could I think I bought some paper work down there from the telemarketing um but you know basically they just told me the investigations take time that I really thought you know we're all going to march back up the hill\nOf a research before they could do that a little bit disappointed I finally got the ... by when I was thirty six years old ... literally Twenty years you know I was always a bit of a rebel I push boundaries when this happened\nYou know sixteen years old that I was living on my own I'm In ... Iraq because I thought I was going in there every day but I was raised to\nStick up for people and to not let something like that just go by\nJacqueline stone speaking with the CBC is to some Proctor NBC\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nA few things that Canadians loved back in the beautiful ladies Corey heart roots sweat shirts and the Hyundai Pony if you don't remember that last one lots of Canadians to the Korean car sold like gangbusters here take a listen to this TV spot for Nineteen eighty seven\nAnother thirty seconds of common sense from Hyundai\nValue that's why Canadians have been buying hunting Kony is that the right to paint every hour one hundred every day since Nineteen eighty four\nCome and see for yourself the eighty seven Hyundai Pony has more no extra costs features more built in value to better by than anything else on the market today more good news Sunday you know to the media similar cast rebates of five hundred or nine hundred dollars on every new pony great car great price greed that\nYes the pony was all over Canadian roads in that era these days sadly or more likely to bump into Corey heart than spot to pony up for a spin\nOn because I Would put it politely they were not exactly built to last worthy [noise] but now a dealership in Quebec has put a rare Nineteen eighty six pony up for sale they say it is in ... condition\nAnd they are asking Fifteen thousand dollars to explain the allure of the pony we reached automotive writer Brendan Mac earlier in Vancouver\nFriend and for those who has never laid eyes on a Hyundai Pony can you describe but it looks like\nWell it's three or four door hatch\nIt's originally was designed\nBy an Italian design firm but we got to face lifted one with a square bumpers and square headlights so it really just looks like you know the Nineteen eighties and most of them if you happen to see one are usually got a a bit of rest on them it would be rare to see one in good condition\nSo basically they say of it is kind of like that from the Nineteen eighties the same as the shoulder pads were wearing a jacket yeah it's just a big box\nNo now why did Canada has sent away and Canadians have to love affair with a Hyundai Pony\nThe main thing to remember about Canada that unites us all more than anything is that we are really in love with a good bargain were really cheap\nSo this car came out in December of eighty three as a Nineteen eighty four model it cost five thousand nine hundred and Ninety four dollars\nAnd that was thousands less than a Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic [noise] um and it looked nicer than some of the sort of really inexpensive Eastern European stuff that was available in Canada and not be us\nSo we immediately started buying these things up or like crazy the initial run I think we're supposed to be five thousand cars and they ended up selling twenty five thousand\n[noise] this is in the Nineteen eighties so why do we never see Hyundai ponies around any more\n[noise] the problem is that they were good value initially but they were very disposable car they just did not last there's some stories about the door hinges would only open so many times before they would fail", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "Pullman", "day": "04"}
