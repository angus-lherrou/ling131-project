has it it just popped up a week ago it wasn't even a thunderstorm for friday and ah you know we're all shaking our heads saying how did this happen and you know it's like a nightmare\nUm how did this happened so quickly\nWell how did it happen how would how are they are no warnings what what are you hearing\nWell it was a thunderstorm last friday and south of the Yucatan and then Saturday morning it was a tropical storm and I was not that concern at that point but I have a number of boat captains that became very concerned\nAnd they said this is one that we need to watch\nAnd by Sunday Morning it was almost panic vale with everybody I was talking to\nI started to pack up things to take just in case the house will be there knowing in my mind that it was probably going to be at three and I would come back to our house some shingles might be off but I'd come back to our house\nBut there is no way I expected what happened that I was just watching now\nTo get a kind of cogent rendition of the royal family's perspective as a critic styles himself as a kind of loyal opposition somebody wasn't against the monarchy or the idea of the monarchy but just thought they were making some bad decisions\nIt may be that his particular credibility built up over all those years or his prominence as now a Washington Post a contributor uh were irksome to them and maybe they want her to teach a lesson but it's it's really a puzzle in part because it's foreseeable that a lot of western journalists and western diplomats are going to be alarmed\nAt the church to show ...\nGiven that there is no love lost between the two minutes and then Saturday you found me so can we really trust the Turks are saying I mean don't don't they don't they have an avid against the Saudi royal family\nThere is a kind of a an friendliness between the two governments but there's also kind of primitive\nBoth sides have been careful to maintain cordial relations there both important regional players and I think they're both feel the need to continue to get along and really is quite inconvenient for the Turks that for president everyone\nTo have that ruptured now because Saudi is a it's a pretty big trading partner and the economy is in trouble already so there's not much incentive for him to be taken\nQuite a desktop with him it was in fact Mr Christians he wrote about that but why isn't the rest of the world responded saying ... neither spending Donald Trump saying he's concerned that Mr ... he hopes it allows sort itself out what message sense is that sending to the Saudi royal family\nWell I think today a President Trump has spoken a little bit more strongly or a little more supportive leave the Turks so the pressure from the U.S is rising a little bit at the same time\nPresident Trump has made clear that he had a high regard for prints bothered Osama the president's son in law visor Jerry ... has really embraced the hobbit Salma in Saudi Arabia as a partner\nAt the same time the Turkish government ... not super popular in the U.S domestically\nSo it's not it's not an easy decision for the Trump Administration\nThat was sure that unlike Clinton insanity is saying that nothing about this and we don't know what happened to him he's not going to show up alive\nYou never say never but every day gets less and less likely and it's really hard for me to believe that the Saudis are

officially calling yourself a Canadian citizen is thrill enough\nBut at one citizenship events yesterday organizers really upped the ante if you will Marlin Blake is originally from Jamaica he took part in yesterday's event as his customary he had to take the oath fencing oh Canada\nAs it is not at all customary his citizenship ceremony took place three hundred and fifty six meters up in the air we reached Marlon Blake in Toronto\nAnd Ireland first of all congratulations on becoming a Canadian citizen\nThank you thank you [laughter] why did you want to make Canada your hand I guess\nBecause I'm kinda though is a very um it's a growing economy um there are lots of opportunities the countries are a diverse and like I said over the last ten years or more kinda of immigration I'm system where they welcome new immigrants so those are some of the reasons\nWhy I thought um Canada would be a very good place to live\nAnd and and when and when did you when did you come here from Jamaica\nWhat I came in April ... unfortunately\nDid you bring a family no no I came along and you start is now he's getting oh look as good\nAll right as vascular alert here [laughter] you bet you if you can't miss it isn't in style didn't see any new\nYes yes yes it was amazing it was better than I thought that I ...\nI write tell people to describe how you did your citizenship ceremony way you did your oath\nWell I did it on the ... ...\nWe were actually outside in the open um there was like a like a girl or a standing on the grill on the edge of the ... which is oval one ... one hundred and sixty feet above grown and guide ... actually lean back\nOn the ... which literally\nStir under George the bread that old and then re repeat to it after them and then we sing the national anthem was who was a great\nOkay it's just walking is getting set here at the top of this ... hour you've got some kind of a harness on right with you a little bit then what's his hardest on you lean back\n... ... talk to you like so so I felt like I was actually in the in the air [laughter] what\nWere you not freaking out\nWell initially um actually they are they are supposed to do our practice runs for us right um so individual and then um what did it as a group after\nThere were six of you who are doing your citizens that was just so I mean I you know what people say that it's nervous making enough just to be doing this house it's memorable enough just to do it why should she wanted to do it at the top of this the entire leaning out into space\n[laughter] well actually I didn't know [laughter] I wasn't sure or exactly there are going to do it like um that that part I've tried to me by surprise is on\nYou know I didn't know which I\nDidn't I didn't know that we're going to lead block right I thought it would just like stunned but then they asked us to leave about what it was fine\nBecause by the time we were there for at least ten Fifteen minutes so um before we actually win told they actually did all the safety procedure test check on all those stuff so they check to interrupt everything is secure secured so I think that kind of a plus it gets a lot more comfortable\nAgain I mean people who do the citizenship those I've not done it and I know people who have it's quite a memorable day that's going to do much to make it a special one for you why did you agreed to be one of these people\nWere actually um when I went to do a test in September right um and then after the test [noise] um they call they called me for the interview so when I when I gave her my documents on my id Russia was revealed that and then she asked me if I uh I'm\nOn adventurous person so I said yes then she asked me if I've ever done a bunch of junk that so I told her no she asked me if I Would do it to us though they're not sure and then I'm shocked me if I ever\nDid that sent the Adwok I told her no\nAnd then she asked me if I were interested settled or yes I'm I'm I'll be okay with it\nOne was from Iran Ukraine\nOn those Filipino one of 'em may now on me now and you're from Jamaica and I'm from Jamaica Clinton Clinton mix said yes if all of us were from different countries where one's very diverse women and men\nYes it was like for women and to to him and I I think that maybe that's what made me that I'm such a huge difference because we're all doing it together so I think that a post all that\nGets labels on food in supermarkets said show in climate impact of what this sounds like something that is ambitious as well is it not\nIs it is it is invasion studied very much depends on how it's being done is this a real picture ration so you could actually come scare quite sample a neat a red meat compared to to vegetables so you can actually do a real\nComparison when you're doing your your your grocery shopping and so it it depends on how it's being thought we're very positive about doing ... on on food\nBecause we need to change the way we eating as well we need to you much less a neat and that much more vegetables it's an interesting idea and compare it it depends on how it's being introduced\nYou know that the the issue you say that you don't care what other countries are doing you don't it's what you want them to do the same time it is they're not a problem if you were way ahead of other countries I mean we hear this and can you hear this elsewhere in saying well\nWhy should we be way out there doing something when she was not doing the same thing so I Would you do you expect some pushback from games on this\n[noise] no actually we can see it population which actually say now that the climate is its top of the agenda that's a that's a lot of things saying we need to to move on days and if everybody's waiting for somebody else why should we do something when Trump is is it's leaving to pass it was like why should we do this when he got out of this up to like\nWe need to see just said to ourselves and especially as politicians says I'm saying that's again with the with the un recall in mind\nWhat can we do how big steps can we take and then let us be an inspiration and also a a case other countries can learn from\nThat if if you're saying Denmark isn't going to find out where does that leave while he just mentioned can in the U.S where there's a president denies that climate changes even happening so what we're [laughter] we're we're we're we're we\nI was just about two years of what the effect of using it in and Canadian radio but but but it is serious now but also the positive side trade is actually in the recall it says we have an open window to act now and we need\nCitizens to tell their their governments that politicians they like the politicians you need to act now\nBy me because we we we have to do\nAll that difficult things to say and curiosity you got me wondering where does the word that if you decided you couldn't say ongoing avian radio\n[laughter] it was just
