all Canadians that is how Canada's foreign affairs minister Christian\nThe U.S Mexico Canada agreement comes after months of tough negotiating rumors of concessions and a lot of back and forth trips from Washington DC to Ottawa here is what prime minister Justin Trudeau said today\nI think we have all been through moments or over the course of these negotiations where we felt very close only to see it or not end up working out so I think we were all very mindful that there was a definite window that now with\nWhere the uh the at midnight deadline by the United states to send the tax to Congress I was a very real deadline that gave us an opportunity to work towards it [noise] but I have to say from my own perspective\nIt was there wasn't a single a ha moment there was just a series of okay we got this one settled wow was it was this one and it's not done yet but there is this sense that when things were falling into place\nI think one of the moments for me was when we realized that we had a an intact chapter Nineteen uh that was where I started to realize okay you know what I think I think we're going to be able to get to a to a place 'cause we've kept in place are the rules that protect trade and enforced trade agreements like this\nAnd for his part US President Donald Trump also declared victory today at a press conference in Washington DC a reporter asked him about tensions between him and prime minister Trudeau here's how we responded\nHe's a professional I'm a professional we had very strong tensions that [noise]\nIt was just an unfair deal whether it was Mexico or Canada and now it's a fair deal for everybody it's much different deal it's brand new deal not NAFTA re done it's a brand new deal I just spoke with him we have a great relationship but we're going to work as a partner\nDon't forget the rest of the world or is looking to take advantage of us and has a region you might say and\nWe've got to work very closely together with Canada and Mexico because we'll be able to compete with anybody we have we have things that nobody else has we have energy that nobody else has we have Kimber that nobody else has we have things that\nWell I'm certainly there's been a precedent set in all trade deals up to date\nThat I Want to get that it gets down to the wire they seem to give up a a a percent of the the dairy market or people like to talk about the powerful Gary lock in Canada were over three so far as powerful\nAs some Canadian point of view here's what it looks like we were looking at a really big debt being put into our manufacturing industry in her ... and an auto or an in an auto bills and auto parts\nAnd what we traded and also I trade this dispute mechanism is a chapter Nineteen that was very important to Canada and in exchange they seem to have given up three point six percent to the Canadian dairy market to us farmers\nThat doesn't seem like a I guess it's an awful trade to a lot of Canadians I don't think\nWell I I find it interesting you say that because um that the NAFTA deal is already in place chapter Nineteen was already in place so if chapter Nineteen\nUh why wasn't doing anything about the aluminum and steel tariffs why wasn't it going to be able to protect us from terrorists in our automobile or if if there's not a panel was hostage orange in a forgiving up the dairy industry or not we shouldn't have been concerned about those terrorists in the first place\nBut would you have that we do have walked away we said no deal\nOr it's very complicated obviously a they were getting ready to a hit us with more tariffs so that that was not a good situation for candidates following it but um I I didn't find this was like any other trade negotiation at least\nWith ah the Europeans and the Trans Pacific deal ah everyone was there I think a proceeding fairly\nThis one was more like extortion\nThis one was that they hijacked sectors of our economy they threatened to do irreparable damage to our economy and if we didn't give them what they wanted\nA they would proceed with these terrorists um I I found it was very aggressive there was something that goes shading or this wasn't a negotiation this was a negotiating our way out of a hostage situation\nSo again would you walked away then would you have said no deal I'm not going to be held hostage\nSome somebody has to do this a wage Trump's proceeding in and and uh\nThe way he's he's ruined I I find so many um of parts of society or I thought Canada was going to the country to to stand up to them and said you know this isn't right we have rules in place NAFTA already had a certain rules that you shouldn't have been able to\nTo put tariffs on aluminum and steel and they told me to address those issues we shouldn't have been going any further\nWhat we heard today from having to to to do and some foreign affairs minister freelance\nWest it and they basically said that well that the upside for the dairy farms dairy farmers is that the supply management system is fundamentals and it's at least is still in place and that the dairy farmers are going to be compensated for losses in Sanford is part of this deal so against Canadian point of view\nIt's hard to see how he's lost what would you say back if you could be at that press conference and respond what would you say\nHow did we get to that point that we will no longer looking for a better deal we're just looking to salvage something out of it so that we didn't get some stories I I don't understand why are we allowed ourselves\nTo be on her knees as bad as when we were in a bad position and uh they negotiated to salvage something but uh\nToo as we see how does that change your life how does that change you were in your business\nOr you mentioned that the compensation package or they've had numerous compensation packages or credit for for other trade deals that I received your dollars to date usually instead of giving a money over to a during the farmers to figure out the best way to distribute it they come up with some\nBizarre way of uh investing it in our farms and uh if you don't fit the exact a type that they want for the investments and you're not eligible\nOn the money is always in his shoes so to date I receive dollars\nBut are you going to survive and you're going is your business going to to be okay\nIt's doesn't help I mean of course you know you ... your carry on I'm a I'm Still relatively young I have a son who's wanting to come home and farm\nSo we'll have to make investments in trying to be more efficient or fight back them up and share that we've lost a lot of money a reinvest that money and and and try and get my cash flow back up to where it was before\nA lie survival of the rate at which are going a trading off three plus percent uh every year we only know how a market share\nA knowledge can't continue to go on forever doing that and the problem is is next time you go to negotiate no one's ever happy with what they have they'll want more so if we're already over ten percent of given up of our market\nThe Americans only allowed to present a trade war over ten percent now so who's who's the protection as to who's not a free trader and not enough says\nOkay I'm not so good points that Mr ... thank you well thank you for calling\nChasing her skin is a dairy farmer we reached an inch in brook Quebec and we will have more on the U.S ... later on in the program including various tongue twisting attempts to pronounce the name of the new agreement and an interview with former conservative cabinet minister Peter McCain\n[noise]\n\nFirst there was an earthquake and then came the water a deadly six meter sooner on me\n\n\nPeople below the water is coming today survivor's on the Indonesian island of slow wave see her dealing with the destruction of friday's left behind as we go to Arabic official death toll is over eight hundred that number is likely to rise to over one thousand [noise] officials have been burying the dead in mass\nGraves Rebecca ... is the BBC's Indonesia editor Richard in Palo which was hit by the tsunami\nRebecca can you describe what you're able to see in power right now\nAt the moment I'm standing on one of them in ... in to the worst affected area\nAnd you might hear in the background the sound of have the uh trucks coming in they hiring excavated into the area the has been much needed in the recent day that people being thinking [noise]\nFood the rental within their hands if it hasn't in this heavy building quip meant to try and rescue divide\nAnd also to find vote easy in the rubble of houses that were destroyed by that powerful quake on friday and then also washed away by the tsunami that was triggered by it\nDo they still believe that they can recover people alive or is this the recovery operation at this point [noise]\nThere has been some rescue attempt in the last forty eight hours that have been successful in one place to be killed in a whole\n... hate or a hotel\nThat collapsed the hotel owner was saying yesterday that he was still hearing people yelling out for help underneath rebel but he was able to reach them they did manage to rescue more than twenty four people though using their hands from that hotel\nBut as the days continue the hope of finding people alive I Would have to say I now play and\nYou have been able to get to the hospitals to see what is happening there who's being cared for and how they're being cared for wouldn't tell us to tell us what's going on there\nWe've been to some of the small medical clinic there around ... situation a bury the lake and there's no power to the entire town so\nHospitals and clinics set time too complicated operations are they running out of medical supplies and in most\nOne that we went to there was a young girl a five year old girl that they had found a loan and she had a broken leg and was crying out in pain on a stretch and not far from the body bags [noise]\nShe could remember her name but she didn't know where she lived filled with their parents were so the opposite of with a little ... more to try and find relatives for her\nHow many more cases are like that are families that have been split apart they can't find their children are people who are missing Benny\nWas allegedly in the room when this like assault took place they he has already put out a statement saying that he doesn't remember this a ... but it's totally against the character he knows about having to have\nA he doesn't think happened what more could do with what could the FBI find out from ... that didn't come out in that statement\nWon't Mark Church is a good example of Carol\nStatement that he put out was put out through his lawyer that wasn't sort of has to he wasn't pushed on it he wasn't prodded to remember other details wasn't asked perhaps for the names of people who might have been there if he continues to claim that he mark judge was not\nAnd so that's why I'm agents wants to talk directly to witnesses I'm not saying it all up a lawyer put together a false statement or misleading statement but might have been a cursory statement and it needs to be tested\nAnd some of the things that had been set including by your former boss James Comey is that the the leads that were presented on Thursday to an investigation would be evidence that a judge Kavanaugh\nMay have lied during his testimony that he may have not been fully open about his drinking habits and about his problems in that area of alcohol\nWhat investigators wanted to know about that would that be something that you need to know more about as to what word judge Kavanaugh is drinking habits while he was in in high school and in university\nNot necessarily accept that it's important that anybody up reconfirmation for Supreme Court seat before the Senate Judiciary committee be completely truthful\nSo oddly the underlying conduct whether he drank or drink to excess in high school might not be all that relevant but whether he was honest with the Senate Judiciary committee about his drinking habits I think is relevant\nAnd then they're also the references to the year book that was prevented that remarks that were sent about ... at the time and that he said we're references to drinking when in fact others and said no they were references to sexual activity and some of it quite\nQuite awful about what they might have done I wanted to do to some women so whether he did or didn't do any of those things that what matters or not that he may have misrepresented what that book was saying\nWell to be clear somebody on there\nAnds or buts about that on the other hand if it had to do only with drinking I use that term only cautiously it's still very important that he'd be honest about it before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIf however the underlying conduct is um the way he treated women whether he sexually assaulted or abused them in some way that matters a lot and that's why you want a full FBI investigation to the extent we can find out we need to find out\nAll right we'll be launching Mr Rosenberg I appreciate speaking with you thank you\nCarol thank you for having me on the show and thank you for giving me a chance to talk about the FBI\nCan cause I like\nChuck Rosenberg is a former senior CIA official we reached him at his office in Washington DC [noise]\nGive me\nGive me your guy\nIs nuts\nHe got us MCA\nAs you've heard by now that is the new name for the renegotiated version of NAFTA and that abbreviations awkwardness has many people annoyed for in the case of the Financial Times writer Alan Beatty\nNearly furious media exploded on Twitter trying to stop people from referring to the U.S MCA as an acronym because he says it cannot be pronounced as a word\nWe reached howling bt in Brussels\nAllen us NCAA doesn't really role after time doesn't\nIt doesn't seem to care about language as well as trade deals are kind of disappointing 'cause there was such a thing as a single word you know you could have dumped into slogans like after we done has to that kind of thing and not just ripped and if they're part of yet another abbreviation that you comment he said well\nOkay but you've taken one step further you don't you're not just kind of disappointed you're mad because why because people are using it\nI'm imagining how people using it I'm also not because people say a name when they mean abbreviations and you know an accident and you can say NAFTA is an accident\nBut doesn't that you said this is a hill that you're willing to die on\nAbsolutely absurd why [laughter]\nWell I tell you why I've covered shade for more than ten years okay when I started a as a journalist when I started covering site I realize this is the subject so complicated that they'd be ... started running into fall that says the fall that basically all the stuff I've covered it run into three left his marriage on edge for that and so keeping in your head\nAll these enormous obese patients when you came across one that you could actually say that was actually a pop the acronym you really want to sort of hold on to it I'm a third of the fact that this has gone on disappeared and there'll be certainly seems to be out of angry about it I just find it very disappointing\nNow of course people are arguing that in fact you can turn it into an acronym you could say was ... or ... or something of that nature right I mean it's not all is not lost on\nThe other things as a valid shortage that's the problem of our school system on snowfalls I'm\nJust saying twice three vowels in this there's quite a bit since it was not going to look at you going to\nPut that in the inconvenient and tries to either end you see what you really needed some kind of out in the middle which is what people invented say either he or in a in the middle so suddenly as you just said it was ... as a loose some car or something like this one other thing I've noticed which is unbelievably deceitful I mean if people just switched to conference around\nUm and so people are kind of got what we can say it was more like you you could say it was like well yeah however that just endless tributes wrong because it's the constant during the wrong over\nOkay here's some way to get their next a next is vowing here since there's us does to ladders Canada the aid to ladders and actually the only has one letters really put and actually put the neck in there and he put the ...\nInduced you'd have ... ... I mean that would be three vowels three countries everyone gets their fair share the six letters and everyone has has their two others\nThat will be absolutely great if that flooded named it I Would invite you to address your thanks to the White House in Washington DC but you know they didn't do that and why they called why they didn't do that I can understand that\nYou could also switch it around right some suggesting that we could call it the I think Canada Mexico us and clean and safe seat a and you ask them to be can be if you didn't French\nBuys you that I think it would be perfect that would be absolutely put the news because I won't let you know the touch of existential\nSo you have ... you can actually put ... into this existential angst and candies both the same thing right\nAbsolutely I mean I remember the opening he's done a great novels was I'm not a die today was it yesterday I called in and she just she she didn't care\nI'm I'm you could say that they could just say exactly the same ... and start studying what was it yesterday I Can't remember [laughter] I mean\nThat would be that would be really I'd I'd have gone for is is that had been when they come up with I Would have gone through it it's just sort of the time and live a ...\nBut what's what's missing obviously besides next about is the words free trade and trade isn't even in the world trade isn't in here it's free trade open trade managed a no reference to trade\nAnd so that it doesn't it's we don't even know what kind of agreement to says this non acronym pile of letters doesn't tell us anything does it\nI hate to say 'cause she has legs is not really what time it down but I'm the idea of shade tree trade and so there's not an so discredited you have to even this about trade new dance even say what's it about um and so you know you have an agreement you can't you can safely and it doesn't say go to the doctor just long enough to level\nAnd just for we're noticing today as we were booking interviews and we were riding riding on the board NAFTA we just keep using NAFTA all our all of our interview questions all of our internal documents were just calling it NAFTA do you think that people will seek released keep calling it NAFTA despite this new name\nAnd I think it's an eight ... after a week which is not the Trump White house should make ... cents or ... or the ... and after but yet I think a lot easier but she's been in ... to ... to the place and not enough", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "02"}
