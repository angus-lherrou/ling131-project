understanding of how economies can grow staying in play back from a different point of view right so\nI always hate to ask this question but in a nutshell can you describe your work\nA lot of economics is about stuff you know like more wheat or more corn from you know the the planes and I'm In that world you're always facing trade off you know it's that tradeoff thing\nA have a tour of the

is an important a very important country in the beach and it's an economic power\nUm it's no more important country for a for Muslims it's time to Islam to science\nSo it will be I'm a very major

I Would say is you know not to have a method is process um the sister sister ship gal again are taught that course at ... said\nUm forgiveness is slight quitting cigarettes sometimes you have to do it over and over again so it's just you know it's it is a process and uh she was just so great in presenting things in such a way that anybody\nCould could accept them and explaining the new ones to some of the differences between condoning and forgiving and other things that people\nOften confused and ultimately forgiveness is and for the person being forgiven as for the person who's doing this for different and it changed my outlook on life in general\nOn my relations with people especially people close to me and uh you know it's still or\nIt certainly there it's very fair to say and here I I think it's safe to say that a ... interview Michael's words changed ...\n[noise] uh yeah they did I I just got a Muslim just listening to do it again and um [noise]\nI I mean it's funny just listening to it in today's times uh twelve years later and and realizing that that message is still more important than ever I'm not the time I was listening to Michael and as I was listening to this interview I [laughter]\nI just wasn't expecting the way that it was going to unfold and the reaction that he was describing and as you know when I found out later in the interview that people call them a coward and had shot at him I said\nI said hang on a second [laughter] in the the the message that this man is saying is that the most courageous brave choice I've ever heard somebody ever make [laughter] and it felt like the antidote to this\nEscalating hatred that was was happening in the world and just listening to it again today I'm just like it's still the answer [laughter]\nIt still remains the answer it still remains more important than ever so can you\nDo you remember the details the situation in which you listen to to Michael in this interview\nI was I was driving along in my car and and a Canadian musician spent a lot of time driving across the cat and a lot of time with the CDC and and I would always listen to that that happens and\nAnd you know just one of those things that's on and you're listening to it and you're taking it in but it's one of those interviews that I just kind of zeroed in on ads I clued into what was being said and and to me the part that I was very moved you know just by Michael's reaction in of itself I was very unexpected reaction\nBut what really kind of joke to me into action was was the fact that\nYou know like I said that people shot at him and and and called him a coward and just put him through\nEven more held and then I ... I don't have a son I don't know what it's like to lose one let alone are under the circumstances that Michael last Nick\nI'm so when I found out that that people were doing that to him I just said\nThat to me is just just unconscionable I Need to do something about that and and I need to somehow amplifies message and and yet the you know the context of it was you know ... or ... with this target and they were like hey we got 'em and gay victory um you know mission accomplished that kind of lingo and you know they were using\nA I mean I I I I don't want to speak for Mike on this but they were using Nick can murdered or collie as as\nSo I'm just going to read the the course you know we're going to hear it later on so people know they're not going to miss that\nSo I guess I'm going to have to try and forgiveness because men you know that's all that I got left my boy did not deserve this but neither do the rest I guess I'm going to have to try forgiveness how did those words continue\nThose words came to me right away [laughter] um I think I pulled over and wrote down those words and then as is often the case for me was with writing I I kind of have the initial thing and then I knew I needed to be with that because sometimes the the sort of surface reaction is is not deep enough and I I immediately just\nCared about it so deeply and I and I knew that I was going to be singing and Michael's voice so I wanted to\nDo it properly um it wasn't just about channeling my own feelings about it I really wanted to amplify his voice that was the goal so I wrote those words down and then I actually\nEnded up seeking out to a copy of the interview that you guys had done and I I transcribed it I'm just so I could kind of practice putting words together in the way that Michael put words together and really then just kind of work from there and very carefully put it together\nAnd Michael ... when you first heard that from what was your reaction\nOf ours are reserve or calm\nOr or a turtle whatever crime that um in light of all the negative reactions that I had that someone would hire him for such an understanding of what our men and these are crying during serve\nA generous and there's respect ... may still does every time I ...\n[noise] the two of you became friends didn't you get the door [laughter] what what is the friendship based on where you're just a moment you didn't you did you find you took a too deep replace\nA lute who was a Knicks Knicks best friend organized to a concert and they created a scholarship in Nick's name called burger polluted [laughter]\nAnd they ah invited me down to come perform at a concert and so I went down to west Chester Pennsylvania and I I stayed in a guest room at leaks house where he told me that Nick would have spent much time and um [noise]\nI played this concert and uh I stood on stage and in my view or next friends and family and teachers and Michael and um\nAnd I got to play the song and my whole body shaking just thinking about that moment and how touched I felt to be able to do that in and contribute in that way and then several years in a row I went down in center died and\nAnd then Michael and I were also invited to keep a symposium on forgiveness at a at a college in Philadelphia in two thousand twelve and we got to spend even more time together then I remember going for a long walk together in a park and just just so enjoying our time together\nBut it's I I Believe a generation different since that mean you would be closer to dictate\nAh yeah yeah I'm In my mid thirties so um I I guess about things that could have been is that right Michael Vick were thirty or forty okay so pretty clerks are great down there yeah [noise]\nI'm sticking with a singer songwriter Peter ... who wrote a song called forgiveness and inspired by an interview on as it happens with Michael Byrd I\nImagined down near the line from Norfolk, Virginia as someone who forgave his son's killer in Iraq and uh I I I think we need to hear this on I think at this point I'm going to ask you to be playing Frisbee and it's absolutely\n\nHe asked me to explain it to devastating nothing to say um\nSome things that happen and once they do never go away\n[noise]\nThey tell you that this life there and then you know I think that's why I Will not snow as far as this thing", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "09"}
