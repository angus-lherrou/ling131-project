training did the driver had\nNothing in twenty sixteen when city council meeting to decide on what regulations there should be for a retro drivers what they ended up doing was sort of getting rid of safety training for\nNot just rush hour drivers for taxi drivers as well they lower the bar for everyone it was just like an incredibly requesting students decision or directly what's next step I picked because this tribe or adults and could have passed a the most basic safety safety test he was just\nSo I'm confident uh she had no business transferring the public at all so I'm more looking for is just some bare minimum of safety training some city Chuck just to see that someone actually has a competent and safe driver before they're allowed to pick up members of the public\nBecause when you call it Hoover you don't it's it's a complete stranger who's coming to pick you up you don't know how to accomplish that they are\nThey're earlier this month Hoover candidate that that they think

I took him out in the car that you could practice and he was so\nDifferent cautious he was he was driving so slowly distracting as near as I was like hello like to relax and uh for someone so ... so a

can never really liked mascots and we're clear that they weren't going to have a mascot\nIt they always say that the negativity was going to come first um and I think the reason why it worked was they they embrace that they knew what was coming and then when it came they embrace it and had fun with it in that flip the switch\nNow I'm pretty as many people have pointed out is not exactly pretty um [noise] what's that tension on the way I mean you know I'm I'm intrigued by your first comment that you you were anticipating a negative reaction so was this somehow kind of if you put up something

has has has been very slow to act\nI'm there hasn't been as much public criticism towards him about women do you think he gets the issue of of why women should be included in in the Catholic Church and given leadership positions\nMany of us are calling for equality and are\nNot satisfied by the slow progress that his papacy to bring women into you know substantial leadership position mhm but do you think he gets it you know I I really hope that he is able to meet with men who are a call to be praised as the pastor I Know that he you know would respond to them\nHope I guess what I'm trying to ask you is do you think that Pope Francis is a Catholic leader who can grasp uh why it's necessary in two thousand Eighteen to fully include women um I guess I'll have to see so\nFar he hasn't made any moves to include women in substantial voting to stand or made tremendous steps towards women in the position\nI mean five years down the line and I are are you know tired of waiting and but I I I
