cold\nAnd when I when the ladder fell my leg got caught and one of the rungs ladder so it broke and it was my left leg that broke and so when I hit the water or the water kept my legs from like um kept it really cold and stuff so I didn't feel it\nAnd um and then I was like you know I went into survival mode\nYou were down there how long before someone who has\nThree and a half hours in the freezing cold waters yeah this is like hypothermia territory yeah yeah\nSo you are okay with the cold and you could ...\nI I'm I asked they were like well do you need anything I'm like yeah I'm I'm like I said I'm like I don't have a shirt on um something like half naked can you certainly down a blanket her shirt or something and they did but then the blanket got hot on the top of the ladder
