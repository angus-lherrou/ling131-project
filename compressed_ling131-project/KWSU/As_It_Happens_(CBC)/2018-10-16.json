they did this deal how this deal is going to affect them right\nAbsolutely and Lawrence will want to stay for it so he was made to stay and um he was getting quite cranky at the end of it because one young mother unproductive ripped into him and told them don't sign this deal in Lawrence ... the editor and said I'm going to sign this deal\nSo well I was being a bit of a problem or not white and he

acknowledge the apology did he accept your apology\nOh wow I've never heard from Lawrence are where the alarm falls on a problem in the front or almost rather altered yeah it'd be in the front lawn for further on those terrible agriculture do you think he's got enough problems related\nI bet you did go on and it's not it didn't you you didn't stop there you said that ah you said he should tender his resignation and come home to ... and then you said please don't be remembered as the jerk that destroyed the dairy industry\nSo now you tell them he's going to be a jerk if he doesn't resign\nFall

jerk\nFall outlaw what's over those are like oh\nThere's one other thing about uh your relationship with as it happens you're you ah\nDo just write letters to the editor you sent a selfie with your cows we got that just last month and you're adding to our fiftieth anniversary and being on the air we asked people to send us where they listen to the show and you wrote on your tweet never miss\nAs it happens it's been on in the milking parlor all my life meet my boy Oliver and twenty cows all becoming informed how are the cows feel about hearing you on as it happens tonight\nOh store\nWell I Hope I Am\nWell I I don't think it should count on that at all rattled but you don't\nWash above [laughter] yo yo ma ma and all that all headed off all of a lot of work on them like\nYou sure at All right thanks a lot rather talk to you take care bye no\nPart of the study as much as possible\nAnd I know the CIA funded study and they did some polling\nOr even better when they drive when they're under the influence of what do you make of that\n[noise] it's interesting because in in our study what we did ask them at different times ... also how the south about their driving safety and the majority of our participant I'm didn't feel that they would be safe drivers and even after five hours\nThe they have some self awareness ability and that's interesting when we're thinking about maybe going through with uh some self awareness campaigns\nSo you didn't have those one in five young to know the other more no but also there they were they're aware that there is a test and so those are probably being more reflective ... on their lives gate\nYeah it might be the case you're right uh that they may be more reflective because they're in a study about driving and and the use of candidates so\nAgain I'm thinking forward in terms of public awareness campaigns and if we can if they can be targeted to subsidize a Republican and the young drivers I think that's an interesting way one interesting way to go\nBut given your research given what you found out what what would what would you advise and the way of trying to teach young people about marijuana and driving\nI think that that bought the ... messages that if you are under the influence of Kennedy's if you smoke\nOr inhaling you shouldn't be driving and you should wait long enough period of time before a dry resuming you're driving in our case even after five hours or their capacity was telling parents so\nUh you need to get a weight to significant amount of time before taking 'em to wield again\nYou were looking at Eighteen to twenty four year old and then you know you were interested in knowing how senior citizens who might be interested in marijuana for medicinal reasons as well as recreational I mean that are you looking to do similar studies like this\nI there are many studied needed but there are other groups that we didn't look at in our study so as you were mentioning a\nOlder I'm drivers who are using a candidates for medicinal reason a daily users of Kennedy's um these are all different groups and I don't know that we can extrapolate our results to these other groups where the impact\nOr the influence of Kennedy's me having different effect\nAll right well very very interesting information during this historical weeks so\nProfessor is about ... from the school of physical and occupational therapy at McGill University we reached her in Montreal\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[laughter]\n... long is struggling to sell something that once seemed like a no brainer Mr long is Justin Trudeau the minister of inter governmental affairs he took on the job this summer as what was once widespread support for liberals carbon pricing plan\nBegan to implode and the Trudeau government has put the plan at the center of a commitment to combat climate change\nBut Ontario Manitoba scotch one and the odds are all now oppose we reached inter governmental affairs miniature Dominic ... in Ottawa\nMinister to that you had a broad presents us support for your carbon pricing plan was ambitious than they are on side now you have premiums would be ... lining up to fight to even to take you to court what went wrong\nBut so Carol from our perspective um we have been consistent with Canadians uh and with our international and global partners to Canada\nMust take urgent action to face the real challenges of climate change we campaigned on that in twenty Fifteen as you noted are referred to in twenty sixteen the provinces a ball signed a framework agreement which book about a number of measures\nAnd some provincial elections have created circumstances where different governments are now saying that they want to take a different approach we've also said publicly that our provincial election doesn't actually constitute a climate change bland and\nGrow Boston serious action so we're continuing towards the commitment we made around for example putting a price on pollution making polluters pay\nBack to what you just said because you said that they're taking a different tack\nYou have ... years and opinions Ontario ah they want to be premier of Alberta who quite possibly will be new premier\nWho I not opposing you would take me different tax they are campaigning by fighting the carbon tax they are putting a rallying come and fight the carbon tax they're raising funds\nFor their campaigns on the backs them saying we're going to tear up this carbon tax idea so it's not just a little bit of push back you have a full scale wind coming to argue\n[laughter] so ah again if some conservative leaders are conservative ... want to run campaigns on particular issues they can explain to their citizens and be accountable for those campaign decisions I don't\nOr purport to understand or or speak for the campaign strategy of different conservative leaders across the country but if conservative leaders and in this case Andrew sheer federally does not have any semblance Ernie coherent\nPlans to meet the challenges of climate change or telling Canadians we do and and provincial premier can organize rallies if they want and say\nWhat they want it those partisan rallies what we're focused on a is bringing\nForward a very clear and robust plan to tackle the serious challenge of climate change which Canadians see in their daily lives is very real we saw like heroin New Brunswick with a historic floods last spring the wildfires in British Columbia the tornados that hit auto up\nAnd get you know a few weeks ago so Canadians notice Israel and they expect their government to take coherent and concerted action\nThan we have said that we will we are prepared to do that and with the case of promises that decide not to be partners we have a federal plan including a price on pollution which will come into effect on January first\nAnd we will then be in a position to give the money back to Canadians in those jurisdictions where we apply to federal plan because provincial leaders have decided not to take their obligations seriously\nI guess I'm asking is that some of these ... years are actually campaigning on fighting the carbon tax or calling it the job killing taxes you know and they're being successful doing that isn't entirely their fault that people are buying into it that or isn't that the fact that possibly you're a liberal government the federal government has failed\nKilling taxes that was a phrase Mr Harper used to use all the time in the house of commons I remember that when we were sitting in the corner in third place he used to accuse the liberals have having all these job killing tax secret plans\nAnd Canadians took us from from third place to first place with a majority government and implementing a price on pollution and coming up with a robust serious plan\nThat deals with the real challenge of climate change is a commitment we made the Canadians and it's something that our government\nIs very serious about uh about putting in place and as I say I think we need to be careful if there were Thirteen premier of provinces and territories across the country\nJust because one or two or three find a megaphone and go to a rally we shouldn't cross infect other jurisdictions that are working constructively and positively with us on a on these issues\nBut it's not just that you knew that you've got for clean is again you you got Ontario this got one prince Edward island plants now Manitoba I buy in Palestine just a month ago destined to dad was celebrating him in the conservatives who gets it\nAnd then you've got Alberto again and then you could take over the next that's not just a few years more than half the Canadian population\nBut again I been Jason Kidd he has to be careful not to assume the job or premier until he wins it in an elections\nMr Palestine\nBut again that would be a good question for Mr ... because he decides to change his plan or where to draw planned that he had shared with us that included putting a price on pollution\nIf he decides to sort of flip flopper change his approach I don't think that Manitoba buttons um who have seen first hand also the very real effects of climate change in previous years", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "Pullman", "day": "16"}
