the whole war or the\nWell I've been to John ... could happen to anyone else and therefore the whole world should get to know that to face of the Saudi regime\nI don't need to tell you what happened to Jamal ... he was murdered killed in a consulate possibly tortured and dismembered has not not rattled you a little\nIt just it just the auto fighting but uh\nThis is what we should we we should is expected them to start with you and it just on them and they they have it today and could loving people from abroad and lay out a\nKitten executing people in Saudi Arabia for their own opinions therefore the only difference with this incident\nIt it just happened in um international star chart ski and comes to that and it's good that intermission I teach and that's why we're at the soldiers even admit you what they have done\nOr the beginning the in the wrong buttons has the right to the whole war when he says there are ... countries ... has left that comes to that's why the meal or what happened to him and he told you will by your story on that end of it\nThat had these kinds of things I Want to ask you about that because the prime minister said he prevented from offering details but that there would be penalties in the billions if you cancel the contract what's your understanding of what the true price would be\nDon't know I have never been given any access to the contract um but um he knows what is in that contract and I think that people should also recall that there's only a year left in the contract so the question is how many vehicles are still to be shipped\nWhat is the nature of the vehicles were not even sure that they're all labs\nAnd the fact that she knows yes terms or confidential but she knows on Monday he said it was going to be a billion dollars on Wednesday he said oh well a ... billion dollars a was just a figure of speech and now he's saying possible penalties in the billions a\nPlural [noise] so um it's very very unclear\nArmed trade treaties [laughter]\nWe have an obligation not to sell to human rights defenders and the world is going to come after us and and make us live up to ... at the same time\nThese workers much be protected and I want to see a transition I Want to see something in black and white that's not confidential from this prime minister in regard to how he is going to protect these workers and make sure that they have the ability to support their families\nIf there's only a year ago and only so many of them left some of these armored vehicles to deliver what makes you so confident it's worth paying that price them to billions and penalties\nWhat price would you pay on twelve million lives called me and people are expected to perish in the next year because of this war that the Saudis are waging we have to stand up and say uh this is wrong\nNow earlier this year though you weren't calling for those export permit to be canceled you wanted them to be do slow down ... how did your mind changed on that\nWell I'm In terms of um what what was going on I think that there needed to be clarity and it's interesting\nYou talk to you know what was going on in Yemen\nYet what was going on in Yemen and there have been reports over the last a while and speaking with um with representatives from General Dynamics they kept assuring that they had close contact that they actually went and inspected what was going on in Saudi Arabia\nAnd they were sure that there wasn't anything on toward a but clearly a that is I guess more hopeful than a than a than true show\nWell can I just that's just so is it not somewhat naive to believe that when you're shipping these armored vehicles to whatever country that they will always be used for making purposes\nI think it depends on who your customer is and in this case it's a very unreliable customer if we were to find a customers among our NATO allies those who absolutely do not commit to a human rights offenses\nThen we could feel a lot better in terms of of how those vehicles were being used and I want to come back to what I said initially these are probably the best vehicles in the world in terms of peace keeping and keeping peace keepers safe and that uh\nThis is something we could be proud of thank you very much for speaking with me minutes Matheson oh my pleasure take good care and thank you for the opportunity to thank you Bye bye\nI re map as soon as

media one of his tweet said quote a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news unquote [noise]\nOne of the pipe bombs was of course address to CNN and this morning CNN reporter Abby Philip asked to White House press secretary Sarah Sanders\nWhy the president had described the Democrats as quote evil in the past and whether those comments have so division here's that exchange\nRose I hate the word that records on your network a number of times not only did the ... the president that many people that work in an administrator absolutely day in day out there is a negative tonight for the media attention around this president is negative despite historic I\nJob creation despite the fact that our economy is beginning to hide the fact that trade deals that everybody that couldn't be made have been made by the fact that the president is trying to solve law and order at our border and protected the three other Americans out from the east coast to the west coast of north and south he that continue to focus only on the negative\nVery first thing your network did we come out and accused the president of being responsible for that is not okay the first thing should have been condemned the violence\nWas White House press secretary Sarah Sanders answering questions from the media this morning\n\nYesterday afternoon Curtis about he took his first breath of fresh air in over fourteen hours each help described whimsical scientist has spent those fourteen hours sealed in a homemade airtight to ... bio dome on Vancouver Island\nBecause well because\nWe reached Mr ... in Corning British Colombia\nMr Balanchine what is that like to take that first breath of fresh air after fourteen hours enclosed in a plastic wrapped cube\nTrying to say it was pretty fantastic up until then you're really sick and breathing in our regular fresh atmosphere was it was great [noise]\nSo tell us why didn't you shut yourself up in an airtight container\nSo I Do science experiments on my YouTube channel just\nIn order to raise awareness about basic science concept and I think that people really don't understand the climate change because they don't even understand what the IRS made out of and you know it's not their fault but I'm\nTrying to do projects like this one so this one I see myself in a box to raise awareness about the basic science concepts surrounding climate change\nOkay so let's talk about the actual ... down that you constructed and how big is that\nTen feet by ten feet by ten feet so it holds thirty thousand leaders of air which sounds like a lot but really isn't\nAnd and what did you have in there with you if you heard about\n... and the health monitoring equipment and I had a hammock to sleep in a bunch of food about eighty leaders of water and the bucket\nI Would think that would be necessary [laughter] what kind of plants did you have in there with you\nI had a pretty big variety of plants I had some sunflowers and some corn and beans and I had several white cedar trees in there with me diversity is important and an ecosystem\nWhere are you eating any of the plant\nYou know it was eating all dried food because they couldn't cook in their ah because cookie intimate fossil fuels which are would be toxic to me in their\n... and no no I'm no booklet dar or none of none of your favorite records or anything like that\nNo I was actually pretty busy on my phone because I did have life I so I spent pretty much the whole time on Twitter and uh yeah that was that was more exciting than I thought it would be\nSo when I opened the notice it said that we have indication that you have low and you need to sell this document out\nIf you do not show this form out within thirty days we will then move you to be an act of ...\nNow ... click the whole lot of Bell's in my head because you cannot place anyone on the inactive roles unless they have not voted\nAnd at least two federal cycles we had just voted so there was no way they could put us on the inactive was we were being sent that knows illegally we mold within the same county\nAnd setting up count on staff and you challenge and how did you challenge it\nActually because I was oh distressed about I took a picture of it I put it on Twitter\nOr the ACLU shot they contacted me after that they could represent me in a case and I I agree and I'm so thankful for that and we challenged secretary of state ... who's our chief election officer as well as my county\nACLU decided to settle I wanted to take this to court but I was faced with those dilemma\nOf there were a hundred and fifty nine thousand who are in the same circumstances ally when we were sort of in a limbo in terms of the loop be allowed to vote so in order for myself and the other hundred and fifty nine thousand to be allowed to vote I agreed to take the settlement\nBut I Am not happy with the outcome because Brian ... we've seen no punishment\nRight and Brian Kemp as you say is Georgia secretary of state and the Republican candidate for governor he strongly denies that he's attempting to suppress the vote in any way what's your response to him\nMy response to him would be let's have a conversation because there are questions about my case that's simply do not sit the rhetoric that he would like us to believe I was not in an active role that\nBut I mean to know why was targeted because the only thing I can think of I Am black I Am\nAffected by this are and like you black or poor people what memories does that evoke for you and for many black people in Georgia\nOf for me that was so personal you know I made\nCivil rights baby um I grew up during the most turbulent times about history and I have a connection through my own family I mean everyone who was African American in this country we have a connection to the fight\nSince you don't want me to vote you do not see me and it's not one person one vote it's no person no vote\nDo you think the perception that you have and many other people black people uh especially that votes are being depressed that that hurts the legitimacy of elections in the United states\nOh absolutely I'm a big fan of the Democratic process if anything\nShould be nonpartisan that should be passed over throughout the country not just Georgia this has become a partition battle and there's under touch any message that we as Americans can say to anybody else we have no right telling any other country\nYou know we're going to bring democracy cheer shorts when we cannot do this year my husband is on he said veteran my daughter's a veteran I've had people fight for this country\nPut their lives on the line and firms don't you turn around and come
