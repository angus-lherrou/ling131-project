I'm referring to to to that in ... surrounding that in the negotiations surrounding the new uh a U.S MCAA deal I I Believe that this deal I Know for a fact\nThis deal could have been done a long time ago\nI Know it could have been done with Canada having a bigger and better voice at the table I was concerned from the beginning that Mexico would go behind Canada's back and negotiate a deal and of course they did do that and then Canada was forced to the eleventh hour to move in and agree to terms that quite frankly that Mexico negotiated\nAnd so I don't know how to do is a bigger and better voice that you should have been to the table\nWhile I think there should have been to a a negotiator at the table who have had you know ... years of experience in trade law and in in negotiations not someone who uh who who came into the job without that experience that's plain and simple it only makes sense that you put someone in with the most ... most experience to do that job\nWhat are some of the things that you have heard that you know that that he found quite alarming that us media commentators have been saying this week\nWell one of things that come up with the idea that he was an extremist or an Islamist and at some point people even say so sympathetic to ...\nAnd uh I think that was really a terrible exaggeration he had some sympathy for the Muslim Brotherhood there's no question about that that was something I disagreed with him about a quite a lot but the idea that he was an extremist or that he was a a not a journalist but an activist\nOr even more than an activist a conspiratorial person a conspirator it was all I think it is disturbing because I think a lot of it is quite inaccurate and very exaggerated\nI decided that just basically to the Muslim Brotherhood charge because they're they're just different there's varying degrees of radicalism within that organization where was he on the spectrum\nWas some version of a fellow\nGo scene and I think he was sympathetic to Muslim Brotherhood parties in the sense that I Would think he was basically one of these people and and there are lots of them\nWho is basically a liberal but whose sees the Brotherhood as a core part of our democracy it stopped my point of view but it's not a ... an illegitimate eccentric or extreme point of view it's a legitimate perspective\nAnd one of the things that started to float around and was retreating die than other than Donald Trump junior and it was a photo and it took a shanty with Osama bin Laden that rattling around Afghanistan in Seattle just urging somehow in El ... sympathized said what what's the story behind that well\nThat is that is a really great example of how disgusting this has become because\nAt no point in his life was ... and all he does sympathizer or a believer in violence or terrorism he did begin his career as many journalists young journalists are both Arabs and Americans that at the time to covering the war in Afghanistan\nAnd as a as a young Saudi journalist he was able to get in with this new breed of people who at the time we called our ass guns or or you know sort of Arab part of the majority\nAre and then eventually some of them more tuned to becoming a hide the fact that he was covering them partly makes him a sympathizer and the great irony of course is that these people got going and they were in Afghanistan and doing what they were doing because the United states was encouraging them to do it\nAny arms that they had came from the United states and essentially involved in an American covert war\nSo what's behind this he can eat you raise the question why several times why is because there are people who knows that the background to distance to discredit set so why why are they doing it\nI think that the whole point here and it's really disgusting is to try to mitigate the sense of outrage about what's happened to ... an end to kind of say in every round about way\nThat this isn't all that bad because he was either not a journalist but an activist or even a spirit or and he was not a liberal he was an Islamic state or even an extremist and the terrorists or something you know those are the kind of progression of absurdity that you get\nAnd anywhere you go in this direction I think he was intended to make people feel less alarmed less horrified less angry and to recast as less of an outrage\nCool pinion and that would have been before he was killed or a long time after the cases are resolved right now the only thing we can be gained by this frankly is to try to imply that it's not that big a deal and I find that horrible\nI Wonder who who the target is because the same time we have seen a Donald Trump said that journalists at the enemy the people he praised politician for having a ... a journalist so obviously there is no love lost their so what was it was the intended target for this\nI think the intended audience is people on the right of the American spectrum or others who are primed to thanks very badly about the Muslim Brotherhood may be supportive of Israel people on the Christian right intent secularists which you could put me in that last kept but still\nThe point is that I think that there's an idea that America should use being misrepresented being cast as a better person and he was which is ridiculous but I think that's the idea and that people who really learn what he actually thought\nWe'll thinking again about how bad this was that age it really infuriating and they're not all lives like any good\nConspiratorial urban legend there's a grain of truth in parts of it but uh I think the only thing that can be gained right now by getting into it is to make people care less about the fact that he's gone missing and probably dead\nDoes this indicate though that how much they are worried about this story and about the impact that a lot of people worried about how big an impact is the time\nI Would imagine that they don't want the United states to overreact and certainly there are pro Israel voices who do not want the United states to become\nToo strange from Saudi Arabia I Want to keep the heat on Iran and want to make sure that this doesn't mess that up and I actually think that's a very important project but I I think that these are two different matters you know nothing should justify people's sense of outrage about this a heinous atrocities\nThere will be solving this diner to I think\nYou're very welcome Hussein Amish has known Jamal ... for more than Fifteen Years he works at the Arab Gulf states

interesting would you agree with that\n[noise] oh we would like to really call on all our use of the conflict to make sure that is a situation where children can be safe at home or at school or in public places\nThat ... you know we we've been covering this story for more than two years almost four years now\nAnd at each time we revisit these the people like yourself it's worse and the world knows that the the international conferences know that the word is out the pictures of these children at it are are freely available so what does it take\nTo actually get to the political will the international political will to end this war what would it take\nVery right I have spent more than two years in Yemen and I've only seen the situation get was with every passing day and it is sad that that is so much suffering happening\nAnd the world is building a blind eye the parties to the conflict must work to reach an image a political solution\nAnd all those who have influence on the parties to the conflict must do their best to make sure that the suffering of children in Yemen ... will stop so\nWhy do you think the world doesn't moved and what is now the biggest humanitarian crisis in the world\nIt is really high time that the global community pays attention to this crisis\nIt is important to also understand that the impacts of this crisis will go long into the future as of this will affect future generations what is happening to children in Yemen today as many of them use their lives as many of them are deprived of that basic right\nSo it does heightened time that the world notices this crisis and pays attention and it shows that bought these to the conflict reach a negotiated\nAppreciate speaking with you tonight thank you thank you so much by Dr ... the deputy

unstable peace of humans scaffolding a useless waste of carbon sheep sasquatch and a sent to an animal among literally hundreds of other insults none of which I can say on the radio\nSo put aside the fact that senator Donnelly openly claims he's quote not into a fair fight\nAnd that all his acts jokes are really not quite as cutting edge he seems to think\nBecause the fact is by mimicking eight parity deliberately or otherwise he risks becoming one someone trying to establish he is a man of character he has the settlers didn't said that he is a man of caricature [noise]\nIf he was still
