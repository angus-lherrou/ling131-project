McDonald sixteen times\nHe said he was afraid of the Seventeen year old because he was holding a knife but when footage of the incident was finally released\nVan Dyke storey fell apart because for one thing even after the Seventeen year old had fallen to the street the officer continued to shoot him [noise] well today a jury found Jason Van Dyke guilty of second degree murder in the shooting of liquid McDonald\nIs the first time in nearly fifty years at a Chicago police officer has been convicted for an on duty shooting\nAfter that verdict people outside the courthouse celebrated enchanted justice for ...\nOutside when the verdict came down\nBut we will relieve that he was found guilty on a second degree murder as well as each count of aggravated battery I'm mad that he wasn't you know convicted of officer and misconduct because of course he still has an appeal\nBut we're really bad a statement was made today\nTo officers all across the country is that you can continue being a judge jury and executioner\n... when you say relieves did you think it would go the other way\nWhile you know what you if you look in America when\nOfficers go on trial they always get off the majority I'll get off you know you rarely see officers actually getting convicted [noise] so it was do we expect that you know we we were expecting a not guilty verdict who expected him to go home expecting them to put on another\nA police uniform [noise] I'm In the end of the day we are glad that that did not happen\nWhen you say that there there have been I guess I'm thinking about what happened and to a police officer in Dallas who was sentenced to prison in the summer for murder and\nAh there have been some other cases that Oklahoma New York city so you think is the tide tuning or are these cases that I didn't to changing because you've been around a lot of the shootings that didn't know this way\nNo I don't know about trying to we got a lot of work that they're okay we can't stop now we've got to make sure that the criminal justice system works we gotta make sure that we have good state's attorney said good attorney general sense um\nPeople that uh will make up the criminal justice system to be fair you know we need\nA judge's set a diverse you know we don't have made a black or Hispanic judges and the and the cook county and and as a Cook County court you know we have to make sure the criminal the criminal justice system is made up of\nPeople who\nCare to do what's right and until we have that then we don't have anything um we just have small when along the way but we we kinda got lucky\nWhen do you think it was about the evidence they convinced the jury\nWhile you know I think that you know the fact that no other officer to stars a weapon and he got out of his car with them six seconds and he was already firing round the fact that he lived on the stand\nAnd acted like the wind was coming towards him play 'cause park showing no remorse really acted like everything\nIt's a multi helped as well so I mean I think that he did horrible on the stand and the state to turn to rip them apart so I Want to give the state's attorney um\nBanks are bad and uh you know I appreciate the great work that they have done it because I think that they've done a good job [noise] um and they looked at the end the jury looked at all of that evidence and looked at a\n... Jason Van Dyke testimony which now is that we're hearing that a few jury said that that was why they decided he was guilty or maybe it wasn't good for him to take the stand\nHis testimony was ... was that way to defend his guilt that does the video itself can you describe the video and the effect it had on his years in in the ... and like likelihood\nVideo I mean if you look at the video and you see\nYou see someone that shot fall to the ground and you see air smoke are more bullets\nAnd I think the video is very ... I think the jury thought so as well is that why would you keep shooting I think if he didn't shoot the Koran as many times as possible you could have got off the shot and shot him one time\nHe possibly could have gotten off if I had a very a small charge 'em but I think it was the fact that he kept shooting those sixteen bullets why would you keep shooting yeah\nHe was defense which he wasn't a threat in the first place we shouldn't have shot him and the first place because it wasn't a threat but even when you shoot shot him why would you keep shooting [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "Pullman", "day": "06"}
