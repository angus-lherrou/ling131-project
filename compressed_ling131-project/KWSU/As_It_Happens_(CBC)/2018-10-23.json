thinking that they're ... committed a good cook by that they said they had been in dispute and and that these guys died and cut themselves but to pieces\nThat housing will probably look more or less the same but the way we run it will be very different it won't be based on on a you know making profit that means we can offer lower rent and then those buildings still make revenue so then we can use that extra revenue to put it into social housing which would be kind of welfare rate housing\nWhich be also desperately need because the number of homeless center city has doubled since two thousand five\nOkay now you've also said you'll triple the empty home tax why do you think that will be effective\nWell the previous council did bring in a one percent tax on empty homes and we know it's starting to fill units that were\nJust purely being speculated upon really empty condos essentially are they are starting to fill up now is as the owners try to ah you know avoid the tax but we wanted to accelerate this as well and actually we're finding now that some speculators are selling their condos to folks that want to live and\nOkay now into the race with really very tight\nUh your main rival can Sam has not even conceded and assuming he doesn't require a every county I'll be presiding over not just a divided counseling but a divided city I mean how how are you going to push forward with these housing policies without consensus on council are or in the city more broadly\nWell or as an MP for seven years I actually managed to\nKind of the unsinkable as I got to measure path through the house of commons even though it was opposed by the sitting majority Harper government which was to bring electronic petitioning to Canada so I have experience working across the aisle others this kind of joke that I was to both the popular MP and all parties but my own [laughter]\nBecause I Would work so often across the aisle so I'm very familiar with how to do that uh [noise]\nYou know I was ah I I wrote a book with Michael Charles last year a who's a conservative MP and was awful arrested a with a lives with me trying to stop the country Morgan pipeline so\nI have worked across party lines often as an MP and I know I can do that in city council I've already had some great conversations with counselors\nAnd not really paying attention to what party they were elected with\nAn estimated two hundred and sixty five people have died from overdoses in Vancouver already this year your predecessor Gregor Robert and called for the decriminalization of some drugs enforced tastes imply that is making available clean drugs that aren't paying ten what will you do to address the opioid epidemic\nWell I I Know a greater was on the right path the problem is he didn't have a provincial or federal government at least under the Harper regime that was all responsive to specific requests from the city so I think I've said that I Would strike an emergency task force with a health care professionals in the first line responders to give us immediate steps that we can take\nAnd then it's my job to help go and get that implemented so that would be to for example talk to the federal government about getting specific exemptions from the criminal code to talk to the provincial government about some specific health care funding and to really focus on what I've been advised is the best step forward is is a substitution programs\nAnd new ways of uh distributing these substitute drugs\nJust one last question a voter turnout with thirty nine percent that one down from last election what are you going to do to make people feel like it's actually worth showing up to vote\nWell we have the worst electoral system in the world here it's called an at large system it was an import from the United states\nBased on race in in dozens and dozens of US cities\nSo I've said that this will be the last time we uh we used this type of system you can't believe the ballot it's literally it falls off the edge of the table that so long because everybody is included on it we don't have award system like you'd have in Toronto or or Montreal\nAnd so we have to change this for ... for the electric to understand what's going on I think they're as\nClose to two hundred names on the ballot that without really much information about who to vote for so this does have an impact on participation and we have to change it it was the area specialty for me as an academic at Simon Fraser university so this is what I'll be working with the province to get the changes here\nOkay Mr Stewart ... thanks very much and thank you very much for your call\nKennedy's Stewart is the mayor elect in Vancouver and after we recorded that interview mayoral candidate can Sam did

can you describe some of them to me\nThere are some are better genetic cows or other kinds of we celebrating dot com and so we just take him to cool spots\nWhere we have the professional photographer in our area and ah it's kind of how we do our marketing doing these scenic shot just to kind of attract more attention to our firemen cows\nTo form of advertising absolutely so can you describe some of them to me\nThe last ones we are we're at a wood islands concert Ireland during the where the ferry connects pie I Know Scotia and uh we tried to get a picture with the car with a fair in the background\nWhite House and it was a really hot day that there was one of the hottest days in the summer so the cows kind of overeating on us so we decided to take her into the into the ocean\nI guess and uh the cooler often the photographer saw this amazing a shot and she screamed hold the calorie air and she ran into the water with her camera and uh she took that amazing shots at getting a lot of attention now\nThere is also one super models that there is also one in ... the provincial legislature what why there\nAre it's well it's a it's a trademark of printing island in Charlotte town and it just showed up on Saturday mornings so we just went and took the picture and it turned out really good friends around the full\nOf beautiful spot so we've tried to cover the island and um see pictures so\nNow when you're taking the the photographs of the cows don't like what kind of reaction is that a religious people around\nUh they love it uh we usually do it during ... tourist season so there's always a people snapping pictures and asking us what we're doing and then they ... they just admire it and I asked her\nIf they could set the cattle and stuff like that so yeah it's kind of it's pretty neat reaction\nWe've done sunrise shots and the beach in the morning and uh we've walked by a couple of sleeping on the beach and they kind of woke up with a\nPretty big surprise was pretty neat stuff that was much more instead of a romantic shot [laughter]\nYeah that was the sunrise it turned out really nice\nOut here so it's sort of challenges a digital photography for having taking pictures I mean you know you're not exactly as you say working with top model\n[laughter] to keep the cows attention is pretty hard because there's a lot of things going on which there are there out of their comfort zone or when they're on the east and to\nYou but most of them are show ... so they're very well trained and a Halter broken and everything but it's just to uh\nYou know you get them to look at the right direction she loves to get through years pop pop the head and stuff like that she's she's amazing Vicki Fletcher she's she's been doing it for twenty\nIn the world what prompted you to do that\nWe've been doing it for Twenty years um people have done it before and you\nRead magazines out there that we tried to get the cover of for a show that's how it started I Believe and uh so now we just kind of do it for fun every year and a couple of times here will\nWork out on a trailer and we'll go for drives everywhere we go we're going to\nHave you ever thought of doing a cow calendar\nCalendars or I don't know if anybody by scholars anymore but I think we'll do a coffee table book is kind of what we're thinking of doing for\nRight now this is coming when Canadian dairy farmers are 'em upside to an angry about the new trade deal with the United states and Mexico how do you feel about what's happening\nI think Justin Trudeau is going to have to buy a lot of coffee table books\nI had not recalled\nI'm to the incidence he mentioned so one was the incident that I had written about in the ... which was um it was a ... I was groped in the back of the car there were two other people there\nUm and the other two were not anything I had remembered one was another groping which had happened at a at a dance and the other was um [noise] she had said he had kind of\nA close the door and a bathroom while we were in their together and would not let me out until I kissed him which he said I did\nSo I wrote him back and said you know I I don't remember these things I Believe you\nBut I don't remember them and I felt it was really important and kind of ironic if you think about it that I felt I needed to say to him I Believe you\nKnow in the course of the me too movement which is just a bit over a year old now we've seen many men apologized after being public plenty of it and for you what was it like having this experience of someone apologizing without having been named her shamed arm in some ways sort of forced into it\nYeah so so there are two things about his apology one was um and this really did hit me the fact that she did not have to do this I mean he could have and I wrote this in the ... the follow up piece that I that I wrote he could have read the piece recognized himself and thought I Wonder what's for dinner tonight\nYou know and and he could have been quite confident that I Would move on with my life as I have for the past Thirty years and not you know really talk about it anymore and he didn't have to fess up and also the kind of tone and content of his apology was\nIt was exceptional it was\nComplete vulnerability he did not say you know I did this thing but I and I I was just a kid or I didn't know any better or that's just how it was back then he said I did these things he listed them\nIn the ... years I've always wanted to reach out to you and apologize and he just said I'm Sorry\nYeah well and obviously he there was a level of trust with you and for him to be able to do that on some level I mean one of the things that struck me um in in reading your column about that since you don't say whether or not you're accepted his apology\nThat the the the last line in in in your call and and when you receive you're talking about receiving the apology and you're you're right and that is something I can guarantee I won't forget [noise]\nUm why did you choose not to let us know when and of course I'm curious do you accept his apology\nYeah so I I Do accept that I Do accept it and I think that's a big way forward\nTerms of the me too movement I don't think all women need to need to let on and off the hook for their actions and\nI I don't believe that however I think there is a lot of there's a lot of power that women have in freeing men who are able to come to the point that this man was able to county which is to say to\nRecognize a wrong to address the wrong be making making apologizing okay I think is a really powerful thing\nLeslie thank you so much for talking with me today\nThanks for having lunch or\nWe reached Leslie low in Halifax is low is a columnist with the ... and\nIt was one small step for a marathon man and a big leap for the Canadian men's record time\nWhen camel Evans cross the finish line at the trauma of water from marathon yesterday he not only completed his first marathon he smashed or record that had been on the books for forty three years\nVisceral Evans time two hours nine minutes twenty five seconds was forty four seconds faster than the Canadian men's previous record\nAfter recovering from a serious foot injury and this morning camel Evans spoke with Matt Galloway hosts the metro morning CBC Toronto about the record performance\nAh I'm I'm a little bit for sure especially uh just\nThe early turnaround are leaving this morning but I'm looking forward to a bit of a break here and I'm sure I'll feel great after a couple of weeks\nGoing into this race this is your first marathon you had had a great career before on this point but a marathon is completely different um what were your expectations\nI knew I was a very fit and uh I thought\nIf things went well like it a gotten a good time maybe get close to that record but it's like you said the marathon is a different beast and they're just so many things can affect it outside of your control and especially being my first one I I just it was very very unknown to me\nWhy did you want to go from running shorter distances to running the marathon\nI think it's a natural transition for a lot of a distant athlete's foot myself running the five ... on the track\nBut for me I had a very serious surgery on my left ankle in middle of twenty sixteen and um I actually had some difficulty doing track where it goes from that point on just handling the corners of track\nAnd so it was just sort of a natural fit that I could to uh the workouts that the marathon required a little bit easier it was just easier on my body as a result I just ah really took to the training and as a continued on I I Love the corporation and I'm ... now\nIn that recovery Amy you ... you mentioned serious injury um do you run for a long period of time were you concerned that there was a point that maybe you wouldn't be able to run at all\nI don't think I ever faced that but I think that was very serious concern\nWith the surgery I mean you can never do you want to come back from something serious like that back can't be an option but I I had serious doubts at different points in my recovery of boat whether I wanted to continue to do this you know it's very hard road to come back from\nThis record drone drains record stood for forty three years and people have gotten close to the records they've almost beat in the record and then because of the marathon and the fact that it's a long reason anything can happen some things have happened and it's falling apart at what point in the race yesterday or did you start to think seriously that you might have it in your science\nThe reality is I didn't know exactly how close I was into probably the last few kilometers\nPoint it was like anything could still happen are completely blow it so but yeah by that point I was definitely just enjoying and taking it and\nThat was a runner now marathoner can Lebanon's speaking with and she was he turned his men Galloway this morning yesterday Mr lemons broke the forty two year old Canadian men's record low running his very first marathon in Toronto\nThat decades old record was set by Jerome drinking at the ... marathon in Japan in Nineteen Seventy fine\nThe following year after he won that marathon for a third time Mr Dayton spoke with CBC morning side hosts Harry Brown in matching cooked about what it took to win\nA it was a sunny clear day which is a bit unusual normally when I've been there in the past have been rainy or cloudy or or similar type of weather\nYeah I saw a picture were you wearing sunglasses death or life yet\n[laughter] pretty unusual too isn't it\nWell I my either early on usually sensitive to sunlight so when they found out I have to work ...\nWhat are you doing in Honolulu [laughter] taking into the sun and now\nYou started out she ran for about cutting to the report I got here un for about five kilometers in the pack a day and and what are you studying up in your own mind what your pace would be at that stage\nUh yeah my my plan was to run it up as hard as possible uh well not find out but a while on the five minute come out of from the beginning of the\nFirst time they give you time my every five kilometers mark for the first five kilometers which took you to warm up like let the system warmer Bradley had been also do find out from the time to what kind of picture on I was about ... seconds behind that a first marker\nSo I put in a harder effort for the next five kilometers but I ended up with the same time which indicated to me right away that it was not going to be a very attractive marathon and I think the reason for that because I hadn't been able to do and I\nWorked at a at around twenty eight kilometers I started to feel really good myself and then I started to push through to the point a plan for both emotional and physical and does that get harder there and keep out at the longest",
