neighbors to the south or just wrapping up and snuggle up next to the bird on that crowded table is likely to be green bean casserole\nCanceled preparing your same for Thanksgiving just simple dimensions green bean casserole mixed together one can handle cleanup mushrooms\nSo I thought gosh black pepper and some green beans and a couple of friendships French fries one and a half court capital holiday [noise]\nBig cats around like three hundred and fifty for twenty five minute terrorists since they're not actually be French fries and you try to be in for five more minutes we have this green these scientists\nThe green bean casserole the key ingredient of which is a company's cream of mushroom soup [noise]\nThey claimed that it will be serving twenty million American homes this Thanksgiving but this year there will be added poignancy to the dish because of the recipes creator has died at the age of Ninety two\nDarkest Riley Waze supervisor at the camels Test Kitchen when she invented green bean casserole in Nineteen fifty five [noise] long as the food folklore as to who has looked at the enduring popularity on this particular casserole we reached her in Bowling Green Ohio\nProfessor long hounded door kids Riley come to invent the green bean casserole\nChandeliers workers Riley was trying to come up with suggestions for how people could use a product that Campbell since was already producing so she came up with the idea of using the ... at the white sauce [noise]\nPeople were already making casual types of things so it was just a matter of you in the canned food instead of making it from scratch\nAnd was it always intended to be a Thanksgiving dish\nOn you know I don't I don't think so and then it was strictly news for everyday meals as well as ... what a family gatherings in general so ... is not only the thing getting here\n[noise] now I as a kid I had a lot of frozen green beans and cream of mushroom soup but never to gather a what what does what does the green bean casserole tastes like\nA ... as a green beans next done with that too [laughter] so yeah it's a and I think if people didn't call it a casserole they just think of it is green beans with white sauce do you like get lost in small quantities [laughter]\nAnd there are variations in the heat and very Asia and then you can do it very upscale\nSomeone described the original recipe on Twitter as tasting like wet cigarettes would you agree\nNo it's not that bad [laughter] so\nIf people don't like their food mixed together they're not going to like cats are a little of any type than a casserole are kinda stereotyped as being something that health wise and then the last ... they became very popular in the nineteenth\nAll right now the only has a handful of ingredients and it involves less cooking and more combining of the ingredients just recipe got to be considered iconic when really it's not much of a recipe\nIt doesn't require any calling Harry training at all which is part of the reason many people dismiss it as not being real cooking but it's also part of the reason that it became so popular it's something that anyone can make out and\nYou're guaranteed to have an edible out there on\nUm it might not be as tasty as some people would like but for people who don't have a lot of money to experiment or they have extensive ingredients or to take risks with making something very elaborate and then it doesn't work and they have to throw it out we bean casserole always works\nRight it's hard to think that a recipe like this would be a hit today ... with all of these food programs and sort of a ... color narrowing obsession why do you think the green bean casserole was such a hit in mid century America\nIf you keep in mind that the Nineteen fifties was following on in the wake of World War two there was a sense of everyone wanted to unify it didn't want to have exotic or things that were too expensive to to Bahrain this was a dish that cut across\nAll socio economic levels so if you wanted to make it add things that were very expensive you could you know but the basic ingredients were very inexpensive you know to say this is a very democratic\nType of dash I'm as American foreign us which is what people in the Nineteen fifties wanted\nAnd and it became a tradition and it was one that is still popular today a particularly around Thanksgiving isn't mainly missed altered do think\nI Would say in in some places it is not stalls are they cause\nBecause that's something that you know the mothers and grandmothers from the Nineteen fifties were making and then it just became part of family tradition um I think in in the mid west that it represents the industrialization industrialized agriculture that characterizes the region\nOn a lot of the food processing factories are in this area you know so when people say eat local you know then\nLocal [laughter] usually what we didn't even know if it is part of the local scenery and it's part of people's occupation is part of the landscape\nDo you think it's important that people know about darkest Riley that she was the one who came up with a recipe\nIt's always nice for people to get recognition but I think it's important for people to realize that that are invented for commercial reasons can become something that is personally meaningful and it can be part of family tradition mhm and it can be part of a regional tradition\nWill you be making the green bean casserole is Thanksgiving\n[noise] um we usually make a ... version [laughter] and they get from scratch so [laughter]\nYou know what substituting ... what do you when\nAnd more and more of the story came out that you wanted to ... why she was the person that she was\nHome was run by the sisters of bombs to curl which is a complex organization and your mother lived some Ninety two I mean I just two years ago did she ever get an apology for what happened to her\n... when when the story came out the first thing that the bums accords did was to hire a very expensive ... so called Terry prone\nAnd in response to a French documentary filmmaker who I\nCould possibly they story be true of seven hundred Ninety six babies\nLasting effect take time having problems response was to knock the women and children she knocked my mother\nWith direct path to mention that the email is ... is in the public demand it talks about that no bones found in the west of Ireland there are no math grade yeah in the west of Ireland\nIt's just a load of old farming bones you know there was no apology\nNow they've agreed to contribute to and a half million year old a three and a half million Canadian dollars for the costs of the excavation how do you feel about that\nThat that the ... is one of the wealthiest oranges they are one of the biggest health care providers in Ireland on the government estimates that the cost of the excavation will be between five million I'm thirty million\nI'm the bumps the costs think it's okay to pay\nLess than a call so\nNo I don't think that's good enough they um the state or responsible for what happened to to stay in the states should pay equally\nNow the remains are supposedly going to be given quote a respectful burial do you think your sister is ... is among the bones of the babies there\nWe're very cynical because they in twenty twelve there was a report by the hate to say that between two mother and baby home on ... ... babies with traffic\n... de Wilde that they needed to excavate they needed to identify\nI'm we finally to be told yes there is that even the Ninety six babies in those tapes but at the babies being identified because I Believe that night they said is it that the the five year old woman living her life the last maybe Canada maybe America\nWho I've no idea it straight away she literally comes from [noise]\nIf you do find her remains in the graveyard what would you like to see happen\nWhen my mother died two years ago we never
