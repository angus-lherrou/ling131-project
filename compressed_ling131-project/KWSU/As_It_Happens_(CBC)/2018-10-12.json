group that has launched a rescue ship under an Italian flag in the Mediterranean we reached him in Durham North Carolina and we have more on this story on our Web page CBC dot CA slash age [noise]\nBad\nIt was referred to as the hardest test you've never heard of ... worked for years before they take it they often fail on their first try and on the second and third\nNow twenty three wind experts who passed the masters similarly exam this fall have lost their designation the examples given by the court of master ... the group has stripped the titles because it discovered someone leaked information about the ones on the tasting exam the court has that little else about the cheating scandal [noise]\nCourtney she was only the wine journalist who worked as a ... and some of New York's top restaurants we reached her in New York\nCutting you first of all what does it mean to ... to get this title as mass testimony\nIt's probably the most lauded achievement that you could hide in the ... ... people who become master somebody had worked for years and years ... ethical\nAnd then to really get people you have been talking last last is what what did they say these\nIt's still in a lot of shock um and they're really surprised because something like this has never happened before and especially considering that twenty three of the twenty four\nMaster some way to pass this year had work to pass this tasting portion it's usually the most difficult piece of the master ... to pass\nSo it's really just been devastating not only for them but for the entire white beauty\nAnd the exam is majority of the rigors oh three parts of it which is I guess or is a knowledge based part there is a practical parts and then there is the most difficult part which is that the tasting portion of the exam just described for people what it entails\n[noise] yeah absolutely and that's just only ... itself is the highest of four levels that you can achieve within the quarter master ... so you have to pass your introductory certified and advance exam which can take several years to pass\nSo by the time that you get to see her master's only exam first you have to pass Erie a separate gay and then on a later date\nYou have both a practical exam a service exam which also includes questions that you may be given on the floor as ... as well as the tasting exam which is six winds that you must blind taste in twenty five\nTwenty five minutes six wines you're blindfolded or you're you're you're you can't see what you're doing and you have to identify what\n[noise] so you're not blindfolded you can see the winds in front of you it's usually three light\nAnd three red but you must go through each of the wind systematically assess the site the aromas and the ... of the line and then based on what you're tasting you must come to a conclusion on where the wind is from what the great variety is and what vintage the wine is from as well\nWhen you consider the they say that most people blindfolded can't tell the difference between white wine and red wine is really extraordinary without to know\nYeah absolutely\nAnd so this is part of the exam versus the part that has been called into question what exactly happened\nSo we really don't know the quarter master suddenly America's has not released too much information on what specifically happen all we've been told is that a current master ... released information that was pertinent to the tasting flights\nOf the exam so we don't know if that was before during or after the exam because the cats\nIdentity that the wind if they just gave them some clues as to what might be on the exam we really don't know and they have not release any additional information about that\nWhen they cancelled the exam results of the taste portion or the whole exam\nJust the tasting portion and they uh invalidate\nThe results for everybody so that means is that everyone who took the tasting portion of the exam whether they passed or failed now have the opportunity to reset the exam\nWhat did the people who did the exam what did they go through to get to the point where they were doing this test\nI mean it is a huge time and financial investment to study for the masters on my exam but particularly the tasting portion of the exam because you have to taste a lot of wind in order to be able\nTo pass this exam I Know that in the film the ... film that came out a few years ago\nSome estimated that they spent as much as twenty thousand dollars\nOn wind to taste throughout the year before their exam\nAnd the person who is suspected of having given this confidential information to those taking the tests ... wherever he or she went through to get there it's just a huge risk lead to a lot that's been last year I Would imagine\nObsolete when I've spoken to other master ... for the piece that I wrote in seven fifty daily they really\nWere boggled at why somebody would want to cheat the system because it is such a high honor why would they then watch undercut the name by giving someone else information that allows them to cheat the exam\nYou know when we're trying to get someone to talk to us about there's people refused to do an interview ... or send to discern we're talking with you agreed does that surprise you that so many people don't want to even discuss is\n[noise] it doesn't surprise me that those who had gained the title of master ...\nAnd now we're having taken away from them it doesn't surprise me that they don't want to talk at at this point because I think for many the emotions are still raw and they also so badly want to keep this title that they want to think before they say anything publicly because one day they may be members\nIn this organization for me I feel confident speaking about it both as a former ... and also because I have\nSouth and one of them that you're getting a student you who you quoted in the article one of the ... who lost their certificate or this person said to you I Know this is not the intent but I feel like a Marsha I'm embarrassed that I did nothing wrong\nI Want to find a different industry to work and now I Want to be over that's quite an extreme a decision that they would actually leave the profession do understand that sentiment\nI certainly understand that it's heartbreaking for the park and they've worked for many years and the day or so proud although it's only about a month\nNo that's a lot of lip service that they do a very good at it when the liberal government came into power prime minister Justin Trudeau said the most important relationship that he wants to have is with the first nations well\nThat's nothing but left the service and the biggest as a that a liberal government has a give us a nothing but lip service to\nThe elections coming soon they're going to come back and are trying to get support from a first nations tempted her first nations are are going to stronger and get together and and not support a liberal\nGovernment and a relationship right now is a it's a it's damage as ... well describe your work needs to be done on on on a part of a the federal government whoever's in power\nWhat is it you want them to do it and this is not just in this case that let's say in the development of below the poverty level in Alabama that what you are you trying to stop them from developing in or or what what level do you want to see an end in an intervention\nWe want to be part of a of this uh\nThe development we want to be part so that is manageable that they don't have the green light to start to destroy our line and and destroyed a fish habitat and our waterways or not we we we want to have a say in what goes on and\nThrough our rights that are supposed to be protected\nBy the federal government to make sure that we have something to go forward with for for many years to come and we've never been heard we've uh you know the two thousand and five case was a minister uh\nSee the costs are department trying to take up lines ... and then we won that the Supreme Court so you think that this one sort of an easier to make for for a Supreme Court\nSo uh I feel that uh the Supreme Court judges or didn't want to make that decision based on whether to get a backlash from a from the rest of Canada and the federal government doesn't matter what what's what's a party is in power\nThey've always kept a the general public in a dark they don't let them know that they're part of the treaty and that uh they're benefiting more from the tree you didn't know the frustrations or\nHave to get the beginning right he goes from here I see you got the Supreme Court ruling on their side national cheese da di ... in saying that where it takes years into the cartels and over again that this is just going to be lots of court cases lot ... as as we'll hear lots of consultation\nJust wait to see what happens because uh I don't think we we have any faith any court system in in this country anymore and uh\nYou know things are going to change and a half in really a don't speak for the nation's I'm very saddened at the national achieve\nWould be worked closely with uh I Know to try to push a there are enough to gender to basically erode our treaty rich so uh I I have no uh I have no faith in the system today\nAnd says you saying the sleeping giant lakes yes teeth could re thank
