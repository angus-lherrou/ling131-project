Matthew ... is a journalist to cover the rise of outdoor ... we reached Matthew weakens in New York\nNow you know there had been so many failed attempt to assassinate general Abdul magic how come this one was successful how did the assassination take place\nFor the details are still a little unclear but it appears to be um something has happened many other high profile assassinations of where there was an infiltrate or the initial information is being one of the governor's bodyguard actually carried out the attack\nAnd this winter and he was shot and heading to a helicopter he was with its members of the U.S military\nExactly this is a high level meeting with the top us general in Afghanistan General Austin Scott Miller\nA he was apparently out of harm's but outdoor I like the police people killed as was the um spicy or the profit of them I mean and it's unclear what's happened with the governors all my waist up who but a ... at least been injured if not killed as well\nAnd so if we say it is also dead and some are saying he's but he we we haven't had that confirmed and now the only time you just mentioned Abdul Rashid this is the leadership of Kandahar and went down in one fell swoop\nThe ads a devastating blow up the Afghan government and its shore to make the already dire security situation in the south considerably worse\nBut the Taliban and said they've claimed responsibility and they say their target was you know ... rounds quiet is that why was he their target [noise]\nProbably been the number one is how targeted the Taliban or for many years\nTheory was that if you pay people a higher wage they'll buy your product so why why should the government to why don't you do it\nWell a lot of us are in fact on the ... the question came up and some of the some of the seals spoke today with the queen spark were foreign ... minimum wage I I'm One of them some of them thought the abyss income would be better but let's look at the advantages of a basic income\nOver a minimum wage and not seeing that we should not increase minimum wage I think we should but the risk income would be more universal so people caregivers are entrepreneurs people doing community service work people during the gig economy work quote all benefit from the rest of the minimum wage which only applies to a an arrow sector of employment\nSo what's going on with the economy is so it's not that robots will come\nTo take your job or what what it's not like what happened to my dad an uncle who lost their jobs in Ontario manufacturing sector it today so today what's happening is\nAnd the local high paying work and all the experts I mentioned looking at the future of automation are saying that's going to get a lot worse so I think we need to look at ...\nAs an economic issue not a social assistance issue it's a way to grow the economy create jobs make low paying work actually work for everyone so they can compete on a global level and they can actually find find work that suits suits them\nKind of person and it's like you're in your own family you know when when you when you write this rather\nYeah I mean I I have a quite a few stories they intersect with me I mean I grew up in a household that had a hot domestic violence I Wish my mom had the means to leave and I think if she had to be thinking maybe she would we actually see that in in the seventies\nIt the base can come in the U.S almost passed under Richard Nixon\nIt passed in the house the Nixon was going to sign it into law except it some of the experiments running at the time in the U.S and Canada show to an end significant increase in the divorce rate\nAmong married couples who have basic income because women were able to leave abusive households\nThen frankly I think that's a good thing we also see not happened in the trials in Africa and Kenya right now a report of a greater marital harmony or we we've seen in the trials in India for instance women in the villages are taking off their head pieces like dressing more liberally and telling that the researchers that The Elders and the village can't control them any more\nSo when I think we can come as deeply emancipated for women but for everyone because imagine if anyone imagine if you as the listener\nKnew that you would never start if you have this this money coming in and use no shame or on the money this is if we everyone gets a if it's universal the wave roads and and and police protection at hospitals are universal there is no shame and using that money\nTo to stop ticking take a breather figure to think of your life and think of what you want to do next uh imagine the confidence of self reliance the the ambition and we can we can along the entrepreneurship who can release if everyone can take a long term perspective on their lives\nWill be watching to see if the Ontario cabinet responds thinking of that and it's the mantle speaking thank you thank you very much\n... organized the campaign CEOs for basic income we reached him in Toronto\nAnd we received a statement from Ontario ministry of children community in social services it reads in part quote the government for the people has committed to a one hundred day review of social assistance and poverty reduction strategies in Ontario Tibet to assist the one in seven people in the province who are living in poverty\nPlan is expected on November eight twenty eight team unquote\nWhat about a year to go before the next federal election many conservatives are on a push to introduce or reintroduce I guess their leader to Canadians and that means that you are going to be seeing and hearing a lot more of Andrew sheer on this weekend\nSunday Edition we'll be hearing a wide ranging discussion between Mr Sharon Michael and right\nInterview covers a lot of ground here's a patch which in which Michael asks the conservative leader about the disappearance and apparent murder of Saudi journalist ... ...\n... most concerning uh international issue at the moment facing Canada got it would trace you of prime minister of course is the the murders a butchery of Sharell ... I'm In the Saudi consulate in\nIn its them will be fewer prime minister how would you respond or would you cancel any arms deals we have with Saudi Arabia\nWell you know I have to uh I have to be caught the fact that I don't have the same level some briefings that the liberals have in the primary strategies aware of much more to the story than I Am to security and intelligence briefings and things like that\nI Believe though that this incident should be a wakeup call uh about uh the government in Saudi Arabia and about it's it's um [noise]\nUh it's the role it's playing in the world\nI'm I've been reading a lot in this recently and uh it is very disturbing and when you look at what the Saudi Government has has has done in this case the the cover up to follow that\nI ... this is alarming everyone should be concerned about this it that the idea that had happened to you know in another country not not in Canada or not to again\nAt ... the Saudi Government plays a very significant role in geopolitics uh there are a lot of our concerns about the sanctioning of of a terrorist groups and and and where the money flows a lot of that has come through\nA entities within within that country and I think that this ... we all need to get together as as as western democracies liberal democracy I shouldn't say western because in fact struck she's all around the world from freedom loving nations should all come together and say we've got a big problem here if we cannot allow a government to act with impunity\nLater Andrew shears conversation with Michael end right which will be on the Sunday Edition this weekend you can hear the full interview on Sunday [noise]\n\n\n\nIn the festivities in Toronto park yesterday there was one character who stood out tall hairy creature that bore a striking resemblance to poke through the BLM character from the long running TV oh children's program poker outdoor [noise]\nBut it was four twenty on legalization day in Canada so the creature was not poker room at all it was going through the creation of mark Scott who used to play poker roulette special promotional events we reached Scott in Toronto\nNot for those who didn't get a chance to see him letters took a look like\nWell ... would be a play on the iconic poker room which I created a parody of and is a character who will talk about responsible drug use now that Canada has legalized candidates\nFor recreational use there can be more discussion about responsible altered states\nHigh and so that again to the description Doug looks like poker for people who have not seen poker who don't have kids what is Tucker who look like\nWe'll poke who is a poker dotted kangaroo from a show called oak it outdoor\nVery popular with everyone who has kids knows about ... ... and it was about ... they didn't know about token down so this is that this is what you you were ... and you I took ...\nYes I was the um ... out of route land for TV oh and they're affiliated agencies and I got to meet the queen as poker rue I'm Colin Powell came to bring a program called America's Promise with a little red wagon as their symbol\nAnd I'm ... twenty fifth anniversary Saturday Night at the movies I I got to be part of that\nThough is that now we never got the hang of life is really odd hearing it now\nWell yes because poker room or in most of the time until Nineteen Ninety six when he came out of their land talking was a sort of emergency and when I was told to talk I was given the instruction to be kind of like Julia Child\nAnd yes mostly insinuate it like this Merce did in their day\nRight now 'cause we didn't imagine ... ah smoking a giant split with\nNo and that would be the evolution of the next generation where token route and rainbow Lou signal ... who is death and do signing and ... who is a special needs character\nSo this was a project that I've evolved the character from in into an Internet program for eight to thirty year olds\nHow do people react here at the center for twenty has today's is that his runners big rally yeah and um you were there as token I think we just mentioned you were smoking a giant novels these splints and how do people react here\nWill the giants splits as it were is probably the symbol that lets people know that it's poker room and\nI'm I have learned through the media that there were investigations into leaks of cabinet secrets surrounding the new Trudeau cabinet and their decisions\nAnd that apparently some cabinet documents were leaked but charges were not brought for breach of trust against some other civil servants it appears that there was a targeted campaign against admiral Norman\nHe is the one facing trial no one else is even though the investigation revealed there were several leaks around liberal decisions on on ship building he deserves\nAs any Canadian would do a full answer in defense writes both under section seven and eleven of the charter it you know the paternal government talks a lot of a sunny ways and transparency\nThey have the ability to ensure that all documents released we don't care what's in them\nThat will be determined by a court so that he can get a fair hearing\nAnd I know this story was originally published by CBC News journalist at that time has James had more who went to work for a defense minister ... ... just weeks after that story was published is that what you're referring to\nThat's part of the intrigued with this story ... ... you know Mr cut more who reported on defense issues and had served briefly in the armed forces I Believe\nWas aware of of some of these discussions then went and worked internally I Know he wouldn't have been at the cabinet meetings what we're driving at his word there are any discussions involving a\nMr Bryson Mr Trudeau other members of the cabinet with respect to this contract where they advancing concerns that they'd heard from interested parties all of this deserves transparency I think ah\nWhen someone's reputation and literally there's liberty is on the line we should air in favor of making sure his charter rights are respected\nVice admiral Norman is that these ended by Murray had them in very very good defense lawyer with him at the taste for access or is it possible that this political interference doing it's just a particular defense lawyer trying to clean down into ... case against declined\nThere's no question he has very capable council and in fact Mr Goodell said today in the house that our system works when things are left in the hands of defense counsel the trouble is the liberal governments are tying the hands of defense counsel by not providing documents that are central to the case if\nSorry you have to release those documents to see if indeed trust or minutes or cabinet memos were leaked the government can't have it both ways they basically ran\nA very respected senior officer out at the military on a rail I respect the fact he's standing up for his reputation he wants to return to duty if the liberals are prepared to release these documents they should ensure that the the charges are dropped because it's the first\nOne of the day we will be following this time Mr O'Toole thank you\nThank you very much or no deal is a conservative MP we reached him in Ottawa\nOoh ooh what or who knew\nPeople who [noise] [noise]

suffered representing the charming Lee named mo valley\nHad a little trouble following be heavily accented words of his colleague David Linden who represents Glasgow east in Scotland\n... just because I'm from speaking to a number to call these that that I got my face so fiercely including it all going to say about North Korea for people with disabilities can I get one more minute walk is being

of Brooklyn New York Sweden and photograph yesterday with the following demand cold I Need to know why you'd team has been erected on the roof across from my\nOffice so did we so we reached him champagne in Brooklyn tonight when did you first see there's beauty and\nAh well I actually start notice jak on Monday evening I was actually leaving my office to have a bit of a tough talk with a colleague and I brought up the window and thought well that's very ominous\nJust describe what you saw where where is that located in well what does it look like well\nMy office has two very large windows ad like that kind of faces the windows I can\nSee this other route from there but I Can't directly a where the the it was so I kind of stood up and without a very particular angle so yeah it

like a rope connected to a metal blade\nThe roof platform it's got kind of a um\nGradually sloping thing where I suppose the heads rolled she from the um yeah I mean I don't\nThink I've actually seen against him in person before but looking at it from just across the little rover on looks real to me\nNow is there a bucket or anything to catch the heads\nNo I well there it's kind of by the lid on the roof ... um so I Can't see over there but it doesn't look like there's anything below it or like around it there's not a you know there's no other a prop around it from what I can say\nSo heads rolled they'll just roll off the side of the building\nThat was like I think there's been a little less so they would just kind of role and collect on the roof I suppose I mean there could be had there and I'm just not able to see them right now and you don't know\n... and so and but no people you've not seen any people dead or alive on this roof\nOn I\n...
