she says is man's spreading justice or an overreaction broadly most people felt it fell into one of those two categories\nBut actually it belongs to a third category according to an e anti disinformation website this video was staged and it is Kremlin propaganda Nikolai Nikola ... is a reporter and a video producer with mashable\nDot com it's first of all what kind of on line reaction and comments has this video provoked\nFirst of all before people figure it out of there was a fake video it received quite a substantial coverage in terms of western media everybody was jumping on the bandwagon of a you know it's a woman in Russia\nActually at a preparation for the call you I just opened Google and I and I wrote viral spreading video I just wanted which ... which article that are going to be first and actually you can still see\nThat the majority of the articles in the Google Search or remain the the video that don't know that it's it's actually a state of staged protests are are fake process so that's actually quite as\nThis was a fake story that this man spreading saying was staged\nWhen I first watched it was really strange that the female blogger in individual the female blogger that's talking about this and that staging this a protest\nHas been known in Russia to do this in the past\nBut unlike this particular video she has\nBrought a serious issue is like a you know ups courting and other\nForms of you know sexual assault that women in Russia tend to faith and what what struck me about this video is that the tone was very differently and it was almost the grass isn't the way that she was approaching so called men spreading a people on on the subway and it it just seemed a little bit off in how she was trying to prove a point about an\nIssue like men sprinting which was on an entirely different ballpark to ups courting ones the the article on the eve this information came out that the the evidence that they give\nFor being fake that he was actually published by a an outlet that's owned by Russia Today which is a you know a media outlet that directly owned by the Kremlin or the outlet it's called into now which used to be a show on our website which now its own sort of vertical\nAnd it's quite popular on Facebook\nAnd that's where the the video that when most viral was posted and that's that video actually still is on line or there are other versions of the video that were posted on YouTube or have not been taken down but the original video or Facebook video is actually still on Facebook and I think at the time that I checked it had like six million views [laughter]\nI wasn't do part of the debunking that uh the men who are in it because if people haven't seen the video\nMen are sitting man's spanning on a subway still legs are part she's next to them or standing above them she pours this liquid into their lap say look startled looks at how did we come to know that seems were actors who are paid\nThere's there is an online magazine in ... in St Petersburg called ... and uh they\nPosted some interviews with one of the men who appeared in the video who said that he was actually paid and particularly other other testimonies of people of men in the video were posted online on social media thing uh you know the day appeared in the video and they were\nA couple of paid actors and I think ... posts was you know you you come in for a job with welfare continue and you leave with money in your pocket [noise]\nUm and then what will you know once once to sort of the investigation got a little bit different turned out that potentially get this video was filmed by um by a studio that that are known to have worked with our team\nWhy would this be of interest to the Kremlin propaganda why what what's why why it just seems like a ... not a large issue for the state government why why would they they've helped to fund some and\nIt's it's one of it it's it's sort of like\nOne of many uh issue said they tried to sort of like\nFor debate and and and sort of their anger and the reason why we're talking about it's just they got caught and that's the thing that I think it's different now than\nLet's say two or three years ago and what the video was basically trying to do it is trying to show how a woman is you know is going too far she's being aggressive in in sort of protecting our so called you know in in quotation marks or\nHer feminist sort of philosophy and and the only goal is to is to store I'm On the feminist sentimentality in in ... and people around the world particularly people in the west but it's also you know once this goes back to Russia you know it allows politicians\nFor example to it's a talking point where they can go back and then sort of\nStarts to pour it into more conservative parts of the country I think there was one politician one ah from from putting his party who said really nasty things about this uh\nActivists in about ten minutes and journals so it allows them to to actually bring back certain points about how important is to keep\nA conservative society and to how we shouldn't be like misled by liberal or by a radical liberal sort of ideas like ... and things like that\nWhen you said that that when you checked on line they just turn now even found that to some sites from seed to know that it's fake but do you think it's more the case that they don't care that they're not talking about mainstream media but do you think that there isn't it a point now where it doesn't even matter if it's too as long as it effective\nYes um I think I think\nSo I don't know if it well I don't know if the desired effect is actually achieved I Know that the the article that to you this from ... ah I added a comment that had fourteen thousand like a it's sort of proof that people are are getting kind of enraged\nBy the by the staging act and that it that it potentially had started some anti feminist a sentiment but I\nTo be honest I think we shouldn't place too much\nEmphasis on on these kinds of attempts at propaganda they they are they are plentiful and they exist across confident in in in in Europe and in in the U.S I don't think\nThere are are sort of like a started to worry too much about these kinds of a temperature that that the the ...\nIt is a sort of a hit or miss rather than a or a central central I sort of a strategy All right we'll leave it there Nicaragua thank you\nThank you go in the glove is a reporter and our video producer with mashable dot com or we reached him in London, UK we have more on this story on our website CBC dot CA slash a I H\n\n\n\n\nStacey Kennedy spit into a tube and mailed it off to a DNA testing website and when the results return she was beyond garb smacked yes she found out she was British Irish and

away\nWe reached D.C Kennedy in Ottawa\nStacey when you were growing up did you have any idea that you had more family members out there\nI had absolutely no idea they wish to my brother and I growing up I didn't even have an inkling no idea whatsoever\nWhy did you decide to submit your DNA to this Janine allergy that said\nWell I wanted to know my heritage I'm I suspect it I had some ancestors came from Ireland and I kind of wanted some confirmation and two years ago they sent me my results of where my ancestors came from\nAnd that was the end of that for a while\nBut you got more than you bargained for I didn't you\nCaught a lot more than I bargained for I got a notification just a couple of months ago that I had a family member that I had no idea even exist that's\nNot what did you think when you got that notification\nOh never shown any thoughts going through my head basically I was in shock I was done um I felt almost nauseous was there a mistake could this be a mistake but DNA doesn't lie I mean DNA is DNA so\nI figured I actually have\nTo ... set a close family member and I got her name when I logged into ancestry DNA about her name and I was curious because I had no idea who this girl was that was supposedly a close family member\nAnd I decided to send a message through the ancestry website because as I said I had her name but I didn't know who she was and I reached out to her and said pretty much a who are you and she took off from there\nHad to be done the same thing where she reaching out to you\nI reached out to her first she had just got her result and ah she responded right away we were just in instant communication right from the get\nGo you release some of your your message is back and forth and just saying I just saying Hi across the way and then she answers or you answer I don't want to say I'm starting to wonder if I have another half sibling there\nTo catch people like your father or any way they can and this is a this is their job where do you say to them\n[noise] I understand that maybe they can do the same thing in the they do to my father on somebody the FBI is looking\nFor or some guy or a bus or a car or cream in Iraq or you know I understand that of course we wanna we wanna I better a country you know\nBut I don't understand\nWhy didn't the poor my father who has a a petition already I I I don't understand that it's it's not fair it's not fair I don't like\nThese you know I'm I'm so so sad because I Know I Love the people over there who has\nCream in a wreck cars they stay on the street they're working like nothing happened and my father doesn't have any game in Iraq or not even a parking ticket\nAt the same time you mentioned that he has this petition and plays that she's married to your mother who has become a US citizen they had filed for US citizenship for him US citizenship and immigration said they received the application they confirmed that\nBut that didn't seem to affect the people they ice police in Ohio they said they're going to deport him anyways\nYeah they they they really rule I I have the the email that they central to um\nTo our lawyer they relive rule\nWhat will happen with your stepfather in Argentina he hasn't been there's an Eighteen years what\nWill have an Eighteen years and you have no idea how\nBy is my country you have no idea is really really bad\nAnd we're really

features so because it comes out of psychological research\n... face is first of all back slanted that means that it's slanted towards the lift rather than Iraq\nWhich is unusual and then on top of that we've gotten gaps in all of the lessons and those gaps are there to basically trigger memory by one of our brains impulse which of course to Brazil's shakes his old I'm Broken goals are diagnosed\nThen you found it to be true\nYes so said this this phone he's he's really unlike any other form of a design because it's not really looking at a pure clarity on what it's really wanting to do to actually slowed down the conventional rating encroached there\nAnd so that's how I can do that so it begins to do that by preventing it taught phase which is unfamiliar so that's the ... you know he's just saying that and it slows us down because their brain will spend the time trying to kind of almost sold the puzzle if you if you if you want to think of it like that\nAnd that slows the breathing down on that triggers memories and that's why this has been designed as a high last taught face for the promotion of memory\nWhat did you find out what did they discover when they actually tested this on students\nWere tested across a bet four hundred are much a university students that's the way by and they were given all sorts of tests ranging from test that would just sit in the

with ...\n... how much did memory improves voice sounds thing at a time\nWhen we send them and it was a fairly moderate increase I Believe that the recall with something like about fifty percent using our real I'm using cents to get into it was closer to sixty percent so you know it's certainly I'm fairly mild outcome at this stage but that's it's fairly early research\nI mean you mentioned about
