it sneak around have\nNo idea what it's like I'm sure to come out of the closet 'cause it's it it it's just a relief whereas before I Would be very circumspect and only talk to my friends who I knew\nAnd uh but now it makes it all the difference of the world because anybody who says to me who drove ... well you know\nIt's two thousand and Eighteen this should have all been done fifty years ago when Eliot Trudeau you know he should have said I'm going to legalize cannabis watch may\nAre populations I'm In the study area which I had done in the seventies but also we were very fortunate to have publicly available data from the very day long term ecological research program and\nMany many field biologist had contributed to that database of\nBird abundances ... says all over the past Thirty years so we we looked at those and they told the story of the upper levels of the food Web there wasn't de to decline significant decline and birds in the frogs\nAnd or in parallel with the decline in their food\n[noise] it it just I guess they knew where to register how how consequential you researchers that scientists who have read it were responding to what you are in shock that this is around the world an extremely disturbing a research report did she has\nReally ... and ... ... ... and we've seen this everywhere we're seeing declines of all kinds of\nAnimals and and ... the food chain why is it so much more significant in spite of Puerto Rico\nWell that's a great question yeah I'd like insects are declining globally um frogs\nHave been crashing and going extinct for the past Fifteen to Twenty years that's thought to be primarily a fungus infection but the consequences I think are so somewhat unexpected\nOf our study in that if it's replicated and we'd need more data keep telling\nEveryone that but it's true on these are complex systems we just did a little kid or rain forest um their indicators and in Mexico and the tropical dry forests that Andres and I studied before\nThat a similar declines insects as occurring but we need more data um so the implications however are truly frightening because this has been overlooked central a phenomenon that has profound implications for the future of tropical rain forest\nIf the insects are found to be decreasing and other tropical forests and we are getting the effects on the food Web that we noticed in Puerto Rico than that is a major major another major negative\nComponent for the future of by a diversity and the preservation of of systems um I think it was unexpected it's a it's a rather\nSex and then like that's just been true I think they just take it for granted if the tropics they're warm they're doing fine maybe logging I'm In some cases now pesticides would have an effect but not that kind of\nExtreme collapse\nWhy why why do you think is happening in ... yes\nWell ten years ago actually colleagues of our our as a ... um they predicted that tropical insects would be exquisitely sensitive to increases\nIn temperature and that was counter intuitive for many biologists including myself because you'd think outweigh the second the they evolve and hot arguments how they got it\nAffected by a couple of degrees of warning but they showed that\n... it was like a very narrow range of thermal tolerance\nFor that was their predictions as born out in many laboratory experience pheromones but Andre ... and I went down to Puerto Rico to see if it was truly happening in the tropical rainforests and as far as we can tell the story chewy predictions have been born out\nBad and it's just devastating to have this News I'm glad you went there and back this research and I appreciate you times ... thank you both thank you so much to take care\nBrad lister is a biologist with the

it is in the victim impact statement on O'Donnell refer to it specifically in her\nIndication whatsoever of remorse and uh other than you know I think some self pity that we saw today that there was nothing that we saw were ... ...\nYeah it reached out to the family to say I'm Sorry and that he's remorseful when he talked about was she knows that what he did was wrong and it was terrible but that's something different than reaching out to the family and apologizing to them directly\nMr dancing was also asked for his impressions of Mr Bernardo statement before the parole board\nI thought that he was the exhibit age to be Frank I'm his explanations about justification [noise] uh\nAnd uh his self esteem I don't think that he had an appreciation\nThat he wasn't helping himself [noise]\nUm but as I said and I mean this sincerely I thought the parole board members were was very well prepared and and had fed had really done their research and understood the file and asked important question to bring out some of his response was so [noise] you know we really do applaud the parole board for that [noise] um [noise]\nSomeone like popping out of talks about well what what my book by trigger is is a is low self esteem and we just take that by itself in light of hits his history [noise]\nThere isn't an expert in the world of psychiatry and psychology that wouldn't tell you is that his explanations where for proof positive that he represented us very serious threat to public safety and even more so for the border they did do reaffirmed the dangerous defender
