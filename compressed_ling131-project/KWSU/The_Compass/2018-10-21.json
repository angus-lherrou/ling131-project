was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen the common was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy with students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in class and what we're seeing on the news I suppose banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching it and in some sense struggling trying to understand\nWould come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe not learning in our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economic tosses a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimension to the crisis and Christmas where the good kind of catalyst because\nAt Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics and you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be taught courses which seemed to weigh a financial crisis was actually raging all around them for him to many out of touch the professional have become Wendy colon is the most widely used university textbooks\nIn retrospect she admits these books must stop subjects that we should really important in terms of understanding the crash\nThings as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had spent a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks which we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy side or the one published in\nTwo thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system and I just it was very typical is the way I'm not corrected all mix was taught in universities around the world\nAnd has not changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think it was true or not just about that of many other\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate and go on to steal the financial systems in which we all depend if they get bad advice can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration felt by students and the teachers around the world has given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others are building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionate about\nAnd so I have to put my own hand up here I chair the core charity [noise]\nBut will it different curriculum being [noise]\nIn finance so many other areas the person to pay the piper cooled to\nBankers and politicians\nAnd that's a multi comics professor at Stanford University the U.S [noise]\nShe's frustrated by economists taking refuge in theory and saying what people want to hear well turning a blind eye the bond even criminal behavior by by two can freshman financial stability\nThere is definitely a problem it is very very shocking they remain really fantastic cut in the sense of how they explored the system but in the end ignoring the biggest elephants in the room and all the flooding incentives and all that deception and fraud and all the excessive\nEndangerment that's entirely unnecessary it's just taken is given it's just what they expect the system does she think this was changed following the crisis\nWhat you hear is the more I doubt you know very shockingly you know stuff happens then you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big crisis just wakes you up because you notice it and then he's like oh you know we really had terrible regulations before\nLet's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best can be prevented stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economist could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joe Stiglitz it\nComes down to the continued reliance record numbers on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right he dates this went back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nWere blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers\nThough blind believed that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens as been at the center of my say conservative economics seems Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood\nThat wasn't true I think it'd be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices\nBut somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith the conservatives I'd miss used his ideas even more astounding was the fact that the ...\nThe accident economics explained why markets often don't work the reason that this will hand often seemed invisible wasn't it wasn't there\nThe notion of an invisible hand and supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys themselves things in the self interest in Prince freely without government intervention everyone will be better off\nSo Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for economics by tend to find some other ways in which The Simpsons about perfect markets so flawed the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple it's just that somebody knows something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad\nBehavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation others didn't\nThe factors that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes at any doctor needed their students the markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country [noise]\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem at the heart of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were signs only works\nIf you imagine all humans are the same responding in the same way and ... contributions to the economy can be counted [noise] journalist country muscles book who cooked Adam Smith spinner August the traditional economic theories and methods only makes sense if you imagined humanity\nBe self centered so unlike humans as to be almost a different species in fact some economists have given the species or name\n... economic us\nEconomic it doesn't have any feelings at least they failings and not relevant to his economic decision making heat that sort of rational calculating brain that it always acting additive staff and chest and all of a set of characteristics characteristics that we have been told to view as a male\nAnd even more of it is sort of all the characteristics that economic sketch to great lengths trying to excluded from these models like emotion family the faulty feeling compassion out trade them and all of the things that we have been told that these are not economically round event is not anything that we need to studying economics\nThe crash a lot of people are saying this great good\nPhilosophy and this valley\nNow right idea of what human beings are it's not good we need to bring the other values back in we can't solve our economic problems without the courage to\nThe house with all that make that human and failed economic models in economic theory that is actually based on that\nI agree with Katrin but assuming that people are simply rational ... key die mentions of what makes us human that this was an important reason white Columbus fail to see the crisis coming they do not understand who Bruce collusion and\nTrading testosterone that makes bankers appear to be on steroids even when they not\nMarket during his rights to highlight the bread the factors that influence decisions she's expecting too much of economics we need any discipline to incorporate all aspects of human behavior\nThe growing depth and breadth of knowledge requires more specialized nation but to understand how to tackle real world problems more into this marriage is required\nThe financial crisis happened in my view not because the tools didn't exist in economics to understand what was happening but because the wrong tools were used\nAnd challenging questions were not being honest to individuals in institutions inside and outside the economics discipline the reason for the financial crisis maybe not that economists don't
