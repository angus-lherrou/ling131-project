damage in different parts of the world [noise] and boys actually seen so far is small very small record to well the risk\nFor example a bigger I recommend Sandy the almost wrecked New York in two thousand twelve kind of be ruled out\nWith most financial centers near coasts expected ocean rising great storms will be severely destabilizing climate change should be a global priority for many reasons box in the short term in my view\nA pandemic is the most likely cause of the next financial crisis\nAnd one that will work for the ill prepared for Peter ... the director of the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine discovered Ebola and it's a leading global experts on pandemics I asked him about the risks they pose\nA pandemic could trigger a global recession it all depends how big it is of course and where it's will hit and we know that the Spanish flu a hundred years ago I'm Regina global GDP by about five percent three trillion in these days\nWe know that in Hong Kong a very short lived epidemic of stars really hit the GDP by about close to three percent but it's also an increase by to hundreds base point in the country risks premium so that's another problem\nSo according to the size of the epidemic we're talking about the damage in terms of trillions nothing billions\n[noise]\nFailure to think beyond finance is the first lesson that has yet to be loved the second is that management\nWhich transcends national borders [noise]\n\nIn the u._k. before separation of investments in retail banks has addressed the number but not all the sources of risk so John Vickers of colleagues Oxford University shed the independent commission lump banking sets up by the u._k. government following the crisis I asked him whether this has made banking safe for\nOne reason why Britain had a particularly bad crisis was that we have these gigantic institutions doing ordinary high street banking which we all depend on small businesses depend on day today and all full of global investment banking and I got into trouble on on the loose front\nThen the second heading was how to make the banks more resilient in the sense of being able to absorb losses if we're more likely when the next crisis hits we recommended a kind of separation cooled ring fencing so this is the idea\nThat the only high street banking retail banking current accounts I dropped but it's cool things which we all as individuals and small businesses depends on which a government can't let full life without title calamity\nThat those activities in major banks\nShould be an ... a self standing powder the bank separated from the global investment banking commodities trading derivatives exposure to other kinds of financial institution and all those other things it shifts the dial it increases the odds that you wouldn't imperil domestic banking from a global crisis\nAnd if nonetheless there is some jeopardy so that it puts you in a much better position to do with that crisis\nIn the u._k. despite the adoption of a number of so Jones recommendations banking has become concentrated in fewer hands in the u._k. as in the U.S taxpayers' money was used to bail out the banks and too sweet in terms of the merger with bigger banks\nThe result was that the surviving banks could even bigger and competition was reduced the big banks are not too big to fail and if they collapsed they would bring down the whole system\nListen plight the government's which means the taxpayers have given them an implicit guarantee of survival here's another ... of the bankers' new clothes\nThe size of the largest banks certainly grow that will tell you that they did the favor swallowing the weaker institution but there's really nothing natural do nothing efficient about besides and complexity of these institutions\nPrivileged existence where they keep getting funding despite being sold risky insult pay their too many privileges of too many subsidies that's coming on with the status of being sort of that to begin dominant and so all the counter parties want to deal with you because they know you can't default on your loan\nI also where the measures to prevent them mixed financial crisis and improve matches and made them was\nI think that he has made things worse and even though it may have been their first response you know quick solution it really ended up with a system ten years later that's pretty scary and distorts the economy about competition and about and just about anything\nFor growing complexity into dependency of the banking system was facilitated by revolutionary technological changes such as growing computer power which allowed physics and math graduates to build financial products\nWhich the top buses let alone the regulators politicians and customers do not understand\nFar from reducing an offsetting risk innovations we're raising and spreading it\nI think we were told that all these innovations and that word you know used around Silicon Valley where I Am a lot innovation was kind of a great thing that it would allow you know more efficient funding it would spread the risk ever more efficiently around the world\nAnd instead it was really a lot of financial innovation is really about clever ways to hide or asks and clever ways to avoid taxes and clever ways to do things that are not necessarily as for for society so yeah at some level you you want it functioning financial system and the financial system can do wonderful things\nBut out of control it it's really dangerous and I think that a lot of energy was spent in justifying things that

my paper and it's because fundamentally what happened in two thousand age\nIs we realized that the system was predicated on trusting these very large and powerful intermediaries and windows to resell the entire system fails with it that collapse indicated not only that the system itself has\nSome critical design flaw that got I think the ball going in terms of thinking about what a system might

good\nBut the financial crisis highlighted the extent to which technology can be both a friend for technological change can bring great benefits but it also can be a source of mayhem which amplifies risk\nThe same technologies which would allow me to communicate this program with listeners around the world and for you to disseminated through social media could be used for example by people on
