continuing conversation to begin a philosophers corner at Stanford [noise]\nThat's where it can work he teaches he goes to the committee meetings and all sorts of things\nAnd I just hang around and do a lot [laughter]\nYou been doing ... does does today we're thinking about white privilege and racial injustice well the U.S led to\nRead it it has a long and sorry history when it comes to racial injustice it also has a long history of favor gonna needs concerns and narratives of of white people or those are the people of color but how are these two things white privilege and racial injustice related that's our question for this week\nWell Philadelphia's John don't it don't you think I mean just think about how many times we had to witness the tragedy of unarmed black men and boys little boys getting shot and killed over practically nothing all white people just aren't subject to this kind of crap\nAnd imagine if they were allowed to do you think the uproar would be well ... you get no disagreement from me on those facts can but do you have a point yes I Do have a point to\nEliminate white privilege and which is the unequal treatment of lights and people of color and racial injustice just goes away white privilege is racial injustice well I mean I'm just not convinced that the rapid mistreatment of blacks is an instance\nWe're philosophers that start from the beginning of what exactly do you mean\nBy white criminal I mean the fact that white enjoy so many honored advantages relative to others not just in the criminal justice system but in just about any fear of life you can name John So you think the fact\nOf whites are much more likely to be treated with respect by cops is a sign of honor and white privilege\nWell what did they do to deserve that privileged to be born in light you know racist society yeah I Do\nKnow they were born doesn't everybody black white brown anything in between\nDeserve to be treated with respect just because they're born of course they do what are they being born is all anyone ever has to do to deserve respect so it's not a privilege right well what are you trying to say I'm not sure what you're trying to say that you're misconstrue in two different things related but different\nViolations of black rights\nAnd protection of white privilege and I don't get it look I grant you that cops too often trample the rights of black people that's not to say that they don't trample the rights of flight sometimes to or that they often treat everybody just as they should be treated\nBut violations of black rights are routine and are done with far\nA ... with ... with impunity uh and and when whites are mistreated they're usually isn't doing well you're just pulling my point no I'm refuting your point the problem isn't it the cops are wrong\nTo respect the rights of whites the point is that are wrong to disrespect the rights of black wait a minute how are you denying that there's such a thing as white privilege no not at all\nBut I'm saying that having your rights respect it is not an example of white ...\nLook can you order eliminate racial injustice\nDon't focus on white privilege right closing the country clubs or a a won't help much focus on securing the too often trampled rights of people of color\nOkay I I kind of see your point I mean it's not like I Want the cops that go around violating everybody is right I Want to do that yeah no we don't want to get equal treatment by getting everybody's rights for him so I'm I'm really glad of that yeah but but look white privilege\nPerks are belonging to the country club\nBut but uh uh I'm a\nWhite supremacy there's a lot more serious I got just a fact of\nLife that you're making a nice some nice distinction rather dig more deeply more deeply into them they're important distinctions but right now I'm going to remind our audience you're listening to philosophy talk and today we're thinking about white privilege and racial injustice is eliminating white privilege\nThe key to achieving racial justice or is it really a matter of securing the rights of blacks doesn't really matter whether we use the language a privilege or the language of rights to describe our racial situation can't we just try to fix it and forget about Samantha debates\nPrivileged writes injustice plus your calls and emails when philosophy talk continues [noise]\nGoing to get our monthly e newsletter by testing that word philosophy to to do eight to eight current with upcoming episode content other philosophy on that\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nThat little town that I'm thinking about the risks every block and got a ... living now\nWhat was said\nWhy do you All right do you live\nFlying drugs [noise] to get back get back\nAn hour and I'm Wondering why they're law happen on the news all mind\nWhy what they what they mean if\nYou why do we are I gave you lose things around when as you\nIt by the by\nFood is a really a privilege to be white it All right or is there a deeper wrong to right I'm John Perry this is a lot to be talked to a program that questions everything\nIncluding your poetry but not your intelligence I'm Ken Taylor and we're thinking about white privilege and racial injustice in the key to achieving racial justice eliminating white privilege or is it advancing black right or to those amounted to the same thing\nOur guest is Naomi is Zach from the University of Oregon a author of a white privilege and black rights\nSo now I mean I think we can all agree on the existence of a certain phenomena Scott various dimensions black people are often treated with less respect\nAll that everybody can agree about that phenomena but practically speaking I Wonder why doesn't matter whether we describe this phenomenon in terms of white privilege or black right what does it matter practically speaking\nFrom matters because there's been an erosion due to a couple or or more a U.S Supreme Court rulings of a constitutional rights so the Fourth Amendment is supposed to give us all a protection against unreasonable search and seizure and the fourteenth amendment\nIt's supposed to give everyone equal protection under the law now these amendments are seem to have been violated in these recent high profile cases and\nUh uh the violators the killers are are not punish you know there are they not indicted or else they're not convicted or how much\nAre you saying that if we I mean okay that's all sounds right to me but are you sending legal yeah you're right it sounds like you're suggesting and I'm just trying to make clear whether or not\nYou sound like you're suggesting if we adopt this discourse of white privilege instead of the discourse of of of of violations of black right we're going to be blind to exactly what's wrong what's gone wrong in a situation\nThat's right you know the problem with it ... it was white privilege is not the realities of whites are better off I mean that is a problem but that's not what I'm disputing I'm just saying the discourse of white privilege especially when white people engage in this this course\nIt is kind of ... you know what it's like it's like it's like food he's talking about how wonderful their meal is in response to hearing about world hunger [laughter]\nWell so you're saying gee that sounds that sounds like a pretty darn ing can I say the word damaging a a A N ... indictment of it just goes to fight for and it also sounds like you think\nIt is mostly white people you think ... gauge and the discourse of of of of of white privilege and and but I Know for some reason why\nIt may not be for self serving reason it just may be oblivious or oblivious reasons oblivion\nUm I I ... I think one has to at this point to be a little delicate in indistinguishable who's saying what a about what and it's very different of black people talked about see how to better off and talk about white privilege\nThen if white people in answer to\nThat from otherwise well meaning white people that's what I'm trying to ... I I make a little intervention or concerning\n... Sunday oh me philosophically speaking from Plato's Republic two roles\nTheory of justice philosophers who think about justice tend to go off to thinking about an ideal society\nNow I guess in an ideal society we certainly wouldn't be trampling the rights of blacks but we also wouldn't have at least undeserved privileges for individual rights and know privileges for\nFor people because of their race but it is focusing on an ideal society an ideal justice leading us to kind of Bush to problems one of which is much more grave and serious than the other together [noise]\nWell yeah and then you self centered if we hadn't ideally just society we wouldn't have these discrepancies but we don't and if you actually look real history not the history of philosophy but real history [noise]\nPeople don't care about justice what they care about is injustice so\nYou see that today you know the black lives matter movement is that what didn't come out of a\nPhilosophy clubs wanting to perfect the chandelier of ideal adjusted feeling in the universe I'm hearing that came that came from it and the passion that reaction to the blood on the street you\nSay you have quite a way with words I have to tell you that I Love your way with with what I Want to ask you a question I Want to ask you a question though about white ... I mean I Will get back to the ideal versus a you know non ideal justice but I Want to I Want to focus on white people just for a little bit\nBecause there are lots of white people who will uh I don't like to generalize but there are lots of white people who will acknowledge white privilege I may\nThey take it to be a sign of their bona fides as an ally to a marginalized people that they are willing to acknowledge their white privilege\nThere are others who moving knife vehemently deny a white privilege they well they will turn to their own individual for it to an effort and blah blah blah so I mean it's a complicated thing and how I Wonder\nWhether the you think that those who deny white privilege or those who who are willing to acknowledge white privilege or any way morally different are they birds of a feather or the two sides of the same going or what\nWas political um it's political and I ...\nAnd they'll do more than just acknowledged it their privilege they may actually do some research or support some clauses that lead to legal reforms um and then there are whites who are sort of appalled who are comfortable who like to think of themselves as nice people\nAnd they suddenly become aware that their privileged because they're white and their response to social injustice\nIs to talk about how nice their privileges are\nAnd I think that's useless I think that energy could be much better directed and then in political terms are there are a number of whites who are under educated or who believe that all the ills that befall minorities are their own faults\nAnd die therefore they are in contrast or as hard working white people deserve all the good things that happened to them and they have no privileges that this is just like a slick Khan created by\nWhat happened to Wiley [noise]\nAnyway not\nCatch my eye and my God I\nDon't think so\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] south [noise]\nSay a song called formation which she's saying at the super bowl\nAccording to Saturday Night live white people all over America were shocked to find out that beyond say was black or at any rate a person of color some people thought the performance was too focused on race and identity politics\nWith white singer have the privilege of avoiding that kind of criticism by John Perry this is philosophy talk the program that questions everything except your intelligence time Ken Taylor I guess is down the attack from the University of Oregon and we're thinking about white privilege\nAnd black rights so Naomi or we want to get a a little bit a practical here but let me give you a kind of a a different example into sort we've been using if I I I'm\nKind of old and my started leaving us let's say if it ever existed this long in the past if I Try to go to a hot club I'll be turned down a ... by the guy at the door\nI feel bad about that I'll think young people have all these privileges they can they can read stuff and nine pointing fonts they can go to good clubs\nBut then if I beat up by the police for complaining I Would feel much more serious problem was there you know my rights had been violated where is in the earlier case may be just there was kind of an unfairness involved a little less serious now\nHow should philosophers ah think about these things are you\nBasis for the difference for the distinctions we've made for things that are outrageous violations of justice and things that are just kind of sad facts about our society how should we get started doing that\nWell I think there is a priority for a agree just violations of justice if you're if you're talking if you're looking at the whole social political picture on the other hand if you're if you're a specialist in social philosophy and media studies or\nYou might not care that much and that's fine that's just not what you're working on but if you're looking at the society if you're looking at what's happening in contemporary times I think we have certain things that need to come first\nSo as as a practical example a lot of people think about how how should we think how do you think of affirmative action or in this context of privilege versus violation of rights\nSomebody some people would think of affirmative action as breaking down barriers of white privilege right rather than I mean there's no nobody has a right to be admitted to there's not that the people in people's rights are being violated but certain structures of privilege are being broken down [noise]\nYeah from the ashes interesting in that case I I think that one one of the results of white advantage you could call white privileges that if people are in a position of power they're going to use it for people they know so if you can uh\nUh admit uh students or or hire a other faculty you're going to go to to people like you to children are friends to two people you already know and if you're white it's likely be on the white people affirmative action\nAnd that's called cronyism now affirmative action is a way of of a breaking into that and and creating more opportunities it's not\nIt's not just creating opportunities for people of color are for women it's it's creating opportunities in the structure it's it ain't going into that structure of cronyism\nWhich is lined up with white privilege so\nThat sounds like so you think there it sounds it means that improving justice is if you cronyism as anti justice\nA ton of distributing well I mean this is a kind of distribution of thing cronyism right who to distribute the club memberships to it's kind of ... that sounds on a so it sounds like even though you think a kind of justice is better served by the language of the pursuit of a kind of justice is better served\nBreaking down systems of privilege breaking down these distribution of systems is also a part of justice is is that right\nYes yeah there are different different forms of justices immediate justice you do not want the police to be able to come up to you or your children and shoot them on site that's extremely unjust I mean that's an emergency or\nA situation of injustice but you know there are wider a structural forms of social justice you what you want if we if we have a democracy for her to continue to work on having a democracy\nYou want everybody to have a a reasonable opportunity for the good fan one of the ways that that can happen\nIs to break into systems that are closed because of tradition or because of racial hierarchy and affirmative action is a way of doing\nThat okay that's that's good Charles from Montclair is on the line welcome to philosophies on Charles\nYes I have a different take on this and I think it's more a matter of clout that if you are rich in America at all parts of the establishment who've gone to ... you get treated differently than if you're a poor white or black coal for anything\nYou put in the middle class and to give you an illustration of former President George W book brought into Harvard Business school the coal you'll see difficult to get into the pounding down with a C student took Mario no you know could I Do this or do you do this\nBut the same thing you think General Petraeus\nI might have been able to earn a senior Gail us\nBell I could have to do that in Berkeley\nYet but that was a long time ago it would be pretty hard to replicate George Bush's success don't advise young people coming up to rely on family connections to get them into Yale or however it doesn't work well let\nMe give you a different ... for the general Petraeus\nYou know he was caught handing his mistress secrets okay and so he pays a hundred thousand dollar fine and and now he's employed ... might go to the facts and making ... salary\nWhereas the whistle blower found people who have later was put to sleep for the rest of his life by I'll find government now is that going to different\nThanks for the call a Charles I'm going to turn this over and ask a you know what I mean what she thinks\nShe class ... itself\nAfrican American a professor at Harvard or have\nHad that incident a few years ago where he was stopped after returning trying to get into his own house who's got into an altercation with police was arrested [noise]\nUm [noise] a President Obama has been treated with incredible disrespect or which after a while one can only conclude has a racial component it it it's not it's not class so yeah sure class\nAnd and you know classes not um [noise] one model is a matter of income I mean it has to culture has to do is um networks of social capital education\nClass and money ap classes important but it's not the whole story because um that have been studies on every level of class whites are better off than blacks on every socioeconomic yeah\nI Want to take you back to the distinction you made at the top but I I like but I Want to target it a little more uh you you distinguish white privilege or as a system of perks from white supremacy as an ideology and all that and uh I get your distinction I think it's an important distinction\nUh but I Want to push you a little bit because I was recently reading some stuff of Cornell west\nAnd he diagnosed as a problem with a President Obama by saying President Obama refuses to address the fact\nHe's too good afraid to address the fact that the U.S is still a white supremacist society it's not legally so I mean the laws are at the same but the root problem in the U.S is is white supremacy ... if you look at a critical things you see it everywhere\nNo wanting Cornell says I assume you think Cornel West is wrong or do you think he's right ... I liked your distinction but tell me why you're right and he's ...\nI Am Cornel West is is is is great rhetoric titian okay so so in general\nAre especially when bad things happen from the standpoint of people of color it feels like the word philosophy is like to use this phenomenon algae phenomena logically it's a white supremacist society but it's very important to realize it's not a white supremacist system", "show_name": "Innovation Hub", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "14"}
