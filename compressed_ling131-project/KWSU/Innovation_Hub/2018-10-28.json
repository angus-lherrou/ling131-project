I just I mean again I don't share his votes but he was pretty good at adjusting means to end but so this is a lot of digging I'll remind you this this philosophy chalk it we're coming to use them\nAnd our next segment we're going to take a deeper look at the nature ... is it the only guy the true and the good if they're even always one thing that's reasonable to do or believe in the first place or or does it depend on where we spent\n... the nature of reason along with questions from our live at reasonable audience which is a lot to be talking to get your news [noise]\n\nI'm a\nBig\nBang bang bang bang bang bang man\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nCan now be any\nTime you know [noise]\nYou just do the right\n[noise] [noise]\n...\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nAustin and Adam showman this this philosophy talk I'm Josh slanted\nAnd I'm ... I guess is Steven Pinker and we're asking whether reason tense save us\nCan reason only tell us how to achieve our ultimate aims are kind of also tell us what ultimate aims are worth adopting join the conversation I raising your hand and then Mike from ...\nSafe so look philosophers have talked about the nature of reasons for a long long time way Aristotle Plato or\nNone of that's been was scientific and was like upper story and into it if I Want you to put your cognitive scientist had on [noise] I'm from the perspective of cognitive science how should we think of of reason in this in the twenty first century is it like\nSingle capacity but Descartes right with Plato right is it a bundle of distinct capacities tell us the most astounding thing that's covered in science is\nThe ... discovered about reason\nThere's systematic discrepancies between reasoning that is how the human mind proceeds left to its own devices and resign and the sense of our best understanding of what follows from what for a long list of discrepancies between how we think and how we ought to think\nTo live like the normative uh ... how we ought to think what counts as good as friends lost his rebel and that stuff that norms of rationality right and you're saying the striking thing to come and scientists discovered is that we don't live up to those norms a brain is not an zine to live up to them and\nI'm ... now of course it can't be the case that were incapable of rationality otherwise we'd never be able to make the argument that people are systematically irrational right because we wouldn't have a benchmark rationality against which to compare the human\nWho make that argument people that you know what they are and [laughter] I mean you're the world right now I'm Talking to scientists you bought that argument what about the ordinary or\nWere you you argue it would be incoherent unless we had a standard of what rationality was you could say people are irrational because there'd be no such thing as rationality\nAnd we wouldn't be able to have a conversation in the first place or a conversation about anything else for that matter you wouldn't be able to have this program if there wasn't a standard of rationality that you are exercising\nThings I ... I mean I agree and it seems like the question then is okay how do we get from one Seattle how do we get from our flawed everyday reasoning process is to this more normative standards of reason\nYeah and that's where the norms and institutions have reason I come in principles like a free speech like open debate like the uh avoidance of fallacies like arguing ad hominem or Adrienne from the historical order\nUh from the world all the things that aren't terribly natural twice but once they've implemented them we've seen that collectively they make a smarter than any one of us as individual\nThat's what I was gonna say collectively cause some stuff you were talking about required kind of collective structures but my vision\nRight is a good Pasadena and me in my brain I open my eyes I focus I see the clock on each or help to see the clock but I'm a new job if you have a clock 'cause I Need the concept that I get that\nBut my hearing doesn't require your aid I mean tell us reason is unlike capacity in my brain why do I need the help of all you guys to ah stay on track\nWell in fact one of the fundamental on discovery for philosophy is that I that naive realism just opening your eyes and seeing the world as it is is false that Ari about their sexual illusions and just as there are cases what our eyes to see that there are cases where our minds to say\nYou've got to show where your eyes to see you pull out at a yardstick you um use better methods of a ... in the same thing for logical\nWell but there's something there was a capacity in my brain for vision is a capacity in my brain for audition for scientific things up right from the sensory motor coordination that in by brain but and it just kind of runs that there are illusions and like that but is there a capacity in my brain\nCause all this stuff you're talking about about corruption and the norms that doesn't seem like it's just in my brain it somehow in on the chili electoral votes\nRight can I mean so I mean I think the norms institution for some really important to deep one right to collectively we can achieve much more\nAh in in the demand originally kinda vigilant but you know you recount him in one way to recount is to say oh my God\nWe're all system on were all just blindly distinguished but you do you make of dancing monitors that sits right on so that it has a has a thinks means just a woman just sort of our our automatic kind of your risk stick a very flawed way as a person the data from the world but\nWe also have system too which is our reasoning where we can we can actually reflect on and say oh well boy or destroy my drink looks bad\nBut I guess maybe it isn't actually going to find a way to you know I I tend to agree with Steve that even as an individual level or not doomed because we've got our system too soon as I mean I I mean do\nYou like doesn't seem to be that there are people who don't like the system one system to distinction but are you what it was actually just like\nYeah I I I think it captures something about cognition and I would just add that the system to works not just because we can put on thinking caps and sit back and reflect and and um punter slowly\nThe Senate's fourth or fifth empirical claim were called on to do I get out of has to do experiments to consult data so that was the social institutions that our system to a recruits in the first place and insists on applying that makes for them to affect us\nSo if I were to try to ask well what actually is this capacity for reasons it's partly in our psychology\nBut it's partly somehow distributed in our collective wives together because you're like\nYou are like an instrument for your like part of my communist system 'cause I could it's like a mill says you know anybody who just that that was his own side of the\nBig issue in the ... doesn't know the issue or I Can't remember if you don't even know that it's used as an ... or so so I Need the other person right and somehow it something about my mind\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nMm\n[noise]\n\nRandomly uh\n\n\n[noise]\nI don't know\nThink [noise]\n...\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] I actually\nEnjoy our live musical Tiffany often an Adam Sean I'm just glad the and this is philosophy program the questions every\nStep to your intelligence I can tell you there were asking whether we can say a which is the hardest\nRationally going about it it doesn't necessarily add up to a rational collective decision I think this is one of the heart problems with the twenty first century so what do you think\nIf there we we obviously can't optimize everything I everyone's preferences our or even any criterion by rich everyone's preferences can be simultaneously yeah optimize their hand you can't dispute whether or not rationality and progress knowledge\nAs possible of course it's possible we vote limited smallpox we Center for someone to the moon we invented the Internet and the smartphone and died but I think the timing is\nDoes it have improved things haven't optimize that's right\nBut still take the problem like global warming which is a collective action problem\nRight which I Can't just come up I suppose I could have the killer technology that's out there but that's you know if the tipping point gets too long ago to make people it's often used that technology and all this stuff\nLike that we've got these collective action films and the difference between now and before is that we have impacts on a global scale but we don't really have global institutions or at least not adequate global institution that toward NATO's off so I don't know I think we could be headed for like deep disaster even if we're all a individually for kind of\nLike an adult I just to try to make it worse [laughter] I mean I I'm a big fan of reason as you are\nBut I have a worry in this particular ... um that you know the worry would be well you know young only on the case you were talking about there isn't really a tension\nBetween um the kind of progress comes out of these in life and values and institutions but here it seems as though the program depend upon technological advancement that is causing climate change\nAnd so here it seems like we were having that there's a real problem for the ... we can't just say well let's let's sort of sick enlightenment values on it that's sick progress on it because for me to the very thing that's been causing the problem in the first\n[noise] well I Know because it's causing the potential for disaster that that's not progress I mean I think we could we would all agree well but the thing about a recent as I can always step back and I said the problem is that the application of reason in the past has caused so far\nAnd so we can I indeed frame the technological question as given that we have improved our fiscal standard of living so far the costs of environment how do we change that trade offs and we can enjoy the same benefit an energy capture of moving people around heating homeschooling homes making ...\nThat is ... ... what was the thing is I'm not making a ... will succeed I'm challenging the idea that there's some inherent reason that we cannot yeah but I don't think you and then going back to the collective active right problem\nOnce again I'm not but they make a prediction that ... that I Know that we're going to solve it maybe ... maybe that will be disaster however I don't think it's a problem it is the principal we cannot solve it\nBecause we know the collective action problems I have been solved on a global scale\nTrue global institutions again there's no I'm not guaranteeing this will hire but there is a pathway by which everyone agrees to a sacrifice like the ... like a like a power ... let's get some or a letter to the root of it there's not a guarantee that will take it just there's no in principle reason that we can agree about that one of them to lobby Dr ...\nAli I'm from Iran um I think it's a little bit unfair to judge or reason with advances in technology ... is something that's reasonable kind of the foundation but uh you know\nHow does the reason major happier like sending man to the moon is it something valuable you know\nThere's two parts of one of them is are there can be things that make us better off but don't necessarily make us happier\nBut in general the answer is we we have gotten happier on average a majority of countries to which we have data over the decades all levels of happiness showed that it is a majority of those countries happiness has increased then states by the way he's not one of them [laughter] but I'm a joy eighty eighty seven percent of countries for which we do have to show that they have gotten\nHappier I should have a yeah I said well I think about this question is um Horatio freezing her ready for science record for progress but you know what about in China\nRight so this is something I think a lot about my work about that you know as the the reach of science expands so the the space for entrapment diminishes\nAnd your book in Charlotte shows up such things like ... which is a beam it's but it's also like Sprite ... some fairy godmother isn't you know and it's love and it's ours and things like that\nAnd so I I Want us to kind of rephrase that happiness question this way you know isn't doesn't happiness also depend on ... and where's the where's the it was they scrunch I'm just gonna shrinking shrinking shrinking so\nIntended by science we're not I don't even know what I mean chanted by by love and by art the spray and ferries you can keep up to travel [laughter] they were metaphorical yeah this is I I was in ... in their late ... now I Know there is I Know there's a few that well we've eliminated famine and we've\nThe war for most of the planet [laughter] yeah I saw\nYou know what I really don't know about [laughter] you know about a hit on a\nTreadmill you know you get more and more stuff and you say well there's that older is [laughter] I mean that's part of it it made it what is the point what is the purpose what is my life for what do I give my life over too\nWell you know I really don't think that eliminating disease and starvation and poverty in wars as all that boarding and meeting [laughter]\n... even if you don't a segment war true and it turns out he said no it's not true test the studies show that people are not happier after winning the lottery that veterans are to the wrong thing I'm really\nHappy that I [laughter] I Know [laughter]\nEven if that were true living to ... the age of eight is better than living to the end that's already okay that's a that's a good question I but I I Do agree that we need to have a more heroic narrative of the fact that we are a limited in child mortality and we are reducing war\nHow you can restore the sense of purpose nobility in Hiroshima and excitement to things like world peace and\nSay cheating the United nations sustainable development goals and maybe that doesn't get the blood [laughter] I\nPretty quick if properly advanced in friends\nOkay so the what I Want to do something that we do from time to time here and philosophy talk gonna make you czar of rationality [laughter] have these ... hours and you get to change whatever institutions whatever laws whatever practices educational friend whatever you like nobody can resist it so\nYour task is to make reason govern our lives more and passion and prejudice and bias left\nSo what are you going to do in your day as a\n... I guess a force people to defend their beliefs against or people who criticize them\nI think John Stuart mill in other words I I don't think they start ah and I would um\nAdvanced enormous both in education and an intellectual discourse in general", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Innovation Hub", "city": "Pullman", "day": "28"}
