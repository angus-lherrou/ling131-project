I mean to me that is true that is not writing as much as it is tortured\nGroup that there is another thing that would end up being sort of the best because you have all these weird over the voices reading all these storylines you put it together and it's just very pleasing patchwork\n\n[noise]\nLooking back to the program and this is philosophy dog and we're thinking about the new golden age of television I'm Ken Taylor and I'm\nJosh land what TV show that you watch the challenger assumption I make you think about the new ... ...\nEmail us ... comment that philosophy talked on or a jeep we may see through yours suggestions on our blog and\nWe're joined now by Katherine ... professor of philosophy at northern Arizona university and a contributor to game of Thrones and\nPhilosophy logic cuts deeper than storage Katie welcome to philosophy\nDrones but you published about game of Thrones are so what is it about the show that lens it to a philosophical analysis\n[noise] well I think that I'm particularly drawn to the different characters in game of Thrones and how they represent different um ethical issues or even at different ethical principles so in the publication that I had for game of Thrones and philosophy I talked about and Eris and her\nSort of encounters with the dos rocky and cultural relativism um I think in more recent seasons I'm I'm interested in um portrayals of um gender and race\nUm inability um that various of the different characters represent to like ... say um so I think it's really just like the rich character is that like lend themselves really well to a philosophical\nDiscussion I mean the issue of gender is fascinating because you know if you think about the way the show's evolved it starts out with most of the female characters being presented as basically passive victims are so it comes to their circumstances\nAnd by now we're living more or less than a guide All right you have all these powerful not necessarily always morally pure so the authors but you've got to figure out the nearest er during the ... you are a great joy REO to some extent but\nUh it's not something that's been of interest to UK cheapest sort of a gradual evolution of the ... over the seasons that we've seen\nYeah I have to say that one of the things that drew me to a game of Thrones\nIs the fact that there are like are so many rich female characters like I have you know grew up reading fantasy and watching fantasy movies where women are often lacking and in game of Thrones you have so many interesting female characters and that's not to say that like representations of gender always like\nI don't know praise but um it's really interesting how like we can take the narratives that sort of classic example she starts this is like you said passive character who just sort of you know a victim of circumstances where all these different in her life her brother um called robo um are just telling her what to do essentially\nAnd then we see her develop into an individual and the kind of moral decisions that she has to make later on and how she becomes a leader that people both love and respect without losing any kind of\nUm I guess like stereotypical femininity so like the nearest represents herself as a as a mother she's the mother to everyone so she's both like fully feminine and has some ethical and quality\nThat well in a dragon in centuries until my children were food [noise]\nDon't rocky hadn't crossed the [noise]\nLet me ask you a question about dinners sir you mean ... how many people had she burned with our dragons I don't know and be any by one right they had it coming can buy what right there she rule\nIn in in West rose I mean what's her what's her and she comes with a dragons in forest and she too many many many people with their army right so it I mean she does have a complicated ark and sometimes a her art looks like the evolution from um picked him to\nKind of liberating hero but then she makes all these mistakes he makes a terrible terrible deadly mistakes and then put what rights pushy claim any right to rule over the people of West rose ... to whom she basically said submit or die\nI don't know about that I don't know that that's classic femininity I that's something else that's the monster\nWell I think that um looked at a lot of lot of things and he said they're they're interesting so I think one thing it's like she always sees her people at in terms of just sort of like mother child relationship you know there's that scene which is highly problematic at the end of season three where everyone is calling her her my mother [noise]\nOne of the great things about game of Thrones is that you have a character like the nearest one the one hand is like super sympathetic character we really want to like hurt in season one\nAnd she has he's dragons and it's like mystical background and it's really cool and the other hand I'm like you mentioned what right does she have to go and like conquer all these cities um this is something I talk about with my my students when I when I'm teaching ethics like\nIs it OK in sort of white colonialist fashion to go and demolish these civilizations even in the name of like anti slavery\nBut does raise it I mean it's a question I think it feels like a general question the show which is the question of legitimacy\nHow does power if at all ... you have all these different models exactly up social organization you kind of loose affiliation the wild wings you all the way up to kind of a tyranny under Joffrey and even if a tiny little bit of democracy or the wall so what is there any positive mobile here's\nThe question of legitimacy in ruling is really on especially interesting with the ... so it's the same thing with a lot of things where it's like they kind of electric who is going to be the best rules\nThe west coast um seven kingdoms and on the one hand we think the wild things are bad because they kill Stark's and and you know John's against them or whatever um but then also with with John's arc we see oh those are actually like really interesting people and maybe this is a better style of government than white where we're seeing elsewhere\nSo I I think game of Thrones make that kind of an open question about what sorts of\nEncounters with otherness are um things that we can accept and things that we can't so like\nWhen we encounter other groups of people maybe there are certain practices that we should say like okay you know maybe you eat\nYou know horse hearts and that's part of your religion fine that's cool [laughter] but if like rape and pillage is part of your um your cultural practice maybe we should draw the line there and it's not entirely clear where that line is and it seems like it bends throughout the show\nBut I think that's also true with with life in general so I don't think any with arms is like giving us any answers but it is raising these questions that are for interesting\nLed leads me to cut costs are consequences question if the world is really messed up is it bad to be good because you know next dog is a good terrible world and you might think that if you compromise a little bit and just being a little bit corrupt in the long run things would have worked out\nBut yeah yeah there's a scene where I'm friendly brass and you know goes up to the net and it's like hey what we need to do Robert is dead we need to you know capture Thursday and take her children\nWe must cut Joe free away from his mother across the\nProtector of the ... he hopes the king holds the kingdom [noise] moments like your sister of a moment for\nFor the robot dog troops like some folks who are [noise]\nYour mind like yes I had to take that deal it's a good deal\nBut you know I don't know I think that's a that's challenging because you I think like OK well would that really work out is it okay for net to sort of stick with his values I mean obviously it's bad for him he ends up compromising a little bit because he lives in order to save his children so maybe that's like some\nKind of middle ground I don't know um I think that the ... many of the stark women represent a different kind of morality so you have catlin um who seems you know she isn't this kind of consequences list or the onto logical thinker if we were to peg catlin in a sort of moral theory she would be\nA carrot assess which he really cares about her family and what's close to her\nUm Enron I mean maybe ... is sort of similar [laughter] and this in a sense that she's fighting for like her family I don't know\nThe beginning I had this beautiful story in my mind like generic is becoming their rightful ruler us here in by her side um I wasn't really into her getting married I kinda liked the idea of her just being on her own\nI don't know I I think that she's going to like sacrifice herself I think that'd be the best arcs for her um and I think maybe most of the characters well but I I honestly have no idea I I just might be surprised I Want it to end like hamlet with carnage everywhere [noise]\nBut even at the end of hamlet there's like a couple of people who were like oh you know like they're going to be like oh my goodness\nOkay guinea pigs a laboratory to think you know it's fine [noise]\nGonna teach us some lessons it's going to allow us to discover things about ourselves learn things grow maybe I'm In the way that that other people in the show I understand fiction within the show\nSo jury well thanks so much for helping us think through Westworld together today it's been fantastic having you back on the show\nAnd thank you Josh thank you Ken this was great [noise] Denver it's a lot different George Annenberg helping us make a deeply about the hit TV show what world you're listening to philosophy talking it's the new golden age\nOf television and our next segment will jump to listen to their favorite programs also talk to someone who is being of all things philosophical consulted on major TV show for lots of hers understand in our audience when a lot to be talking [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nLooking back I'm just an idea and this is philosophy tone the program the questions everything except your intelligence I'm Ken Taylor and we're thinking about some of the most philosophically compelling programs in the new golden age of television we're joined now by Pamela here on 'em me she's\nA professor of philosophy at UCLA and get this she has worked as philosophical consulted for the hit NBC show the good place Pamela welcome back to philosophy talk thank you so much so Pamela maybe it's\nI don't live in LA and Hollywood\nTV or movies or anything like that so how did that happen is that just that just something you uh LA philosophers do\nNot at this level um so it is a case that I often at once or twice a year or get a email from somebody who's interested in an idea that they have for a TV show or a movie and if I if I have time I usually um like to talk to them just 'cause it's fun and interesting\nSo I got an email I'm like this about what turned out from Mike sure who um I didn't know who he was but I said sure\nI Would be happy to and then um and then others are preparing for the\nMeeting I looked him up and I thought wow this this is the\nPerson from parks and recreation kind of a big yeah I'm so we met at a local coffee shop for and and just talked about his idea for um for maybe three hours which was extremely fun\nFun topic and then uh when when the show a came up for the second season they invited me back or they actually invited me to the studio to the writers' room and I\nGot to speak with the uh the entire room full of of writers which was which was also extremely fun\nSo tell us about the premise of the show and tell us a little bit more about how you help them a shape to show\nUs or the the premise of the show opens with Eleanor I'm who arrived at quote the good place I'm so she has died\nAnd she has met by Michael who is the architect of the good place and ah Michael explained to her that she has arrived at the good place and um and starts to show her around but a Eleanor knows that there's been a mistake because Eleanor knows that she was not a good person and so I'm really shouldn't be in a good place\nI honestly think I Would check out here by mistake because my mom called me Allen herself drops I don't know I mean he's just wrong about my overall quality level\nShe's hooked up as everybody is with her I suppose it's soul mate who is chi\nChi is a professor of ethics and moral philosophy when she introduced himself in that way on the show when I watched it I cracked up to a treaty as her soul mate and Eleanor convinces cheating to promise her that he won't\nTurn her end or reveals her secret but that ... that he will help her to become a better person so that she might stay in the good place to wait a minute\nGD he's a moral philosopher\nTo help her yeah so then things start going terribly wrong and the good place and Eleanor I'm has a suspicion that it's because of her presence I'm On the show takes off from that\nBut what makes sure was interested in when he was conceiving of the show and and I think the reason he um reached out to me was the um puzzles and difficulties about how to become a better person when you don't start with the motivation to be a good person and and so I had a\nA draft about that puzzle on my on my website and I and I believe he just came across that and then wanted to to talk to me about it\nThat's great that's a lovely question right it's not just a question about what the moral principles are of course how you to bootstrap yourself into any kind of moral sentiment\nThat's the real question and a Eleanor has had led a very problematic life and then none of them are good people there they're all problematic people here's my question though\nWhy in the afterlife why don't why not tell a story about people struggling to become good through their lives I mean what was the point of setting that is in the problematic afterlife\nIt's a great question my guess and I so I did not speak with Mike about that question but my guess is that he was very interested in having this points system and thinking about how much good a person had done in the course of their lives and comparing people\nWhen your time under we calculate the value of your life using are perfectly accurate measurements and\nOnly the people with a very high school the true cream of the crop come to come here to the good what happened with everyone else you out to work\nLater in the show um some contractual is philosopher show up and um and I like to think that was some bit of my influence to to get them thinking you know not just about I'm producing good doing good things are producing good outcomes but also\nUm you know several of Eleanor as a first flashbacks are ways in which she's a ... it's called the free rider where she's trying to never have to be the designated driver or what have you and especially now towards the end of season to\nThe importance of the quality of their relationships with one another and the importance of that to the original question of how it is that we become better people is really starting to come together so it was very pleased to see that I thought you might\nI mean now right because you know she even gets in there by mistake and then what kind of divinity as that but a great play with that very much but I but another does not really she's in a bad place by design nothing good places I mean I Know but we don't know that ... that was a spoiler that Julia but here's the thought that maybe\nI think every settled system where you can't judge a life\nUntil you have the whole life before you have the goodness of a life is only after it's done maybe that's part of the thought\nIt could be it could be um I think the idea was just that um we're used to thinking about judging a person's moral goodness from the standpoint of the eternal judge or from God or from religion and so that just gave a a real focus probably to to the question he wanted to consider\nThat makes sense plus it let them have flying shrimp than you know crazy things\n[laughter] so I wanted to ask you another question that's gonna depend on a a sport that's what again you know listeners close your ears for a second if you haven't caught a way out but\nI really I I Love the way in which a GED starts out the show as a kind of authority on moral behavior but little by little you start to realize that in fact all of his moral knowledge\nHasn't uh helps them to be a morally good person and in fact it seems as though at certain points it's actually being in the way because he thinks too much over analyzes see as experiences moral dumb pounding and and so in fact it all of this moral philosophy\nIsn't any good for us Marley so I I was really curious whether any of that uh you know is is it's part of your thinking or maybe part of your experience around muscle loss of\nA it was something that you talked about a with Mike or um or did he just pick it up by himself it's hard for me to remember all that we\nTalked about in that first meeting but I'm I'm imagine that I did um\nComplain about how difficult philosophers in general not just ethical philosophers fine decision making rent so that definitely is a scene and definitely is that correct same [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Innovation Hub", "city": "Pullman",
