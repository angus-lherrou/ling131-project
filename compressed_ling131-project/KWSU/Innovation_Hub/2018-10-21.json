A. L. W. San Francisco [noise]\nWe're continuing conversations a beginner philosophers corner at Stanford University that's working teaches philosophy and I did for about forty years and today\nWe're thinking about the ethics of international debt\nCan or something like two hundred trillion dollars of debt worldwide and that doesn't include the solar generator I bought from Amazon yesterday but the real problem is that there are twenty four nations in crisis 'cause they can't pay off their debts and a lot of the I mean some of these debtor nations are once rich nations like Greece\nOr Finland but a lot of them are poor developing nations where where the burden of debt is falling mostly on the poor and the disenfranchised all told John it's a massive tragedy of massive human tragedy\nWell so you and I can sit here and moan and well about the tragedy but as philosophers what do we have to add we're not bankers or politicians\nOur job is to analyze concepts not loan money well then let's start by doing that we do best let's analyze the concept of debt and maybe they don't get a similar interesting meant the Shelley well it doesn't seem like the most mysterious concept first you got a debtor who borrows money and uses it\nAnd promises to repay with interest is in there is a creditor who lends money loses the use of it but expects to be repaid with interest that seems a pretty good starred as far as it goes to thank you in the right circumstances can and\n... starting new businesses and it allows the lender to make a profit while simultaneously serving a broader social good with his money\nOr their money and not every time everywhere in history has that been thought to be true John I mean the Bible seems to condemn used every and Shakespeare famously declares that one shouldn't either of power or no or a lender beach I'm a well well did they get it wrong\nWell I Believe Shakespeare ended up penniless me but yeah I think there is just wrong and the right circumstances debt is a fair rational and effective means of making good things happen when you\nMake it sounds so simple to unplug but if we take it to the international debt case that it doesn't seem to me to work that way up at all I mean your analysis\nAssume that we at the same agent who takes out the loan then later as to either repaired or face the consequences of not repay but so it's that one agents rational calculations but you know someone happens in the case of international debt when countries take out loans not not at all\nYeah you're you're you're worried about international debt so you know some leader takes out a debt uses it gets very popular than generations later somebody has to repay that's a good\nPoint yeah and that is is it is one of the problem because the leaders you negotiated the low a loan and for whatever reason aren't necessarily the same as the lender less to make the decision to pay it back or not pay it back when you know the chickens finally come home to roost maybe decades later it can be a mess\nFor leaders come and go uh but nations endure conceptually it's the nation if the agent in these cases the agent to borrow or the repair is one thing to get the Sunday she\nWell I knew that's kind of what you have to say to make your analysis work done but that doesn't change the fact that the people who have to make is a fundamental fact that people have to make these really painful decisions\nTo impose austerity and they're popular so they can be ... that\nMay not be the same as the people who gleefully took out that that's the first place it's like if I took out debts to finance my gambling spree and then everything went awry are expected my son or even my grandchildren to repay the debts that would not be fair to them\nWe look at some possibilities in the next segment debt default and national despair and disaster plus your calls and emails when philosophy talk continues\nVelocity talks community of bankers is the place for deep discussion by becoming a partner in the community you can subscribe to our podcast read professional blogs and then create euro find out more about becoming a partner by visiting philosophy talk to a larger [noise]\n\nBird [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] I\nCan't see them when\nThey're not giving money to you and you're paying me back in\n\nA nice ah handy [noise]\n[noise]\nGiving money to others then expecting to get repaid\nWhether it's bill Joe or an entire nation that's our focus today I'm John Perry this is the last we talked for grandma questions everything except your intelligence I'm Ken Taylor\nAnd we're thinking about the ethics of international debt our guest is Julie Nelson author of economics for human so we want to get to like how to think about this that simple model that Jon\nTalked about and whether it's killed up and went through a model but I Want to ask about ground question first and then we'll dig into that one back up my background question is\nDoesn't or does the world need a regime of international lending and borrow any I mean the American economy couldn't run without borrowing lending could the world economy run without there being credited ...\nProbably not there probably is a need for some kind of system a what we hadn't ours is using the word system is kind of an exaggeration um it's pretty much chaos out there\nIt's chaos out there so we need a better system but it's not all that is I'm just trying to get the John said the world war two debts who was a good thing I mean\nThere there are there are ... that are responsible and and reasonable the the sort of fun you know good debt which is one small subset is a debt that is\nYeah well now they've increased are paying back the principal any interest isn't a problem if you use that that loan or to do something to delete a productive um that's not the case for a lot of the ah the international any time\nIs it makes sense to ask what what is the typical uh interest rate for a poor country to borrow a lot of money\n[noise] depends on who they are getting the loans from um right now on global interest rates are quite low so there's actually quite a lot of money floating around looking for some place to live there you know earn any interest at all or so a lot of poor countries have been I'm filling up on cheap\nOn lending his is now is because our Federal Reserve has the interest rates so low that just kind of right standard all over the world okay so there's a good time to borrow money if you're a poor country will fill you still have to pay it back I Want to go\nBack to John original thought so I ask him we're losing conceptual now who's as to what we philosophers do he writes in a normal person to person or person to institution transaction there's a lender above or you know I borrow money from you you lend money for me where each rational calculators were acting on our own self interest\nRight and economics has a lot to say about transactions between rational calculators acting on each acting on his or her own self interest I mean some people think that the entire foundation of economic theory but it just doesn't seem to me just scale of\nThe nation ... nations right it just doesn't it doesn't doesn't work at all\nWell in the in the receding nations here the person's signing on for the country at the whole it's usually some finance minister\nNow the finance minister it might be signing on to uh to get a loan that's going to find a project owned by his brother in law has not not an atypical I'm sort of situation a lot of cases and yet he was going to pay that back\nUm there's been a limits on on how much for\nMoney tends to move very really among among a country to the the profit if there are any from that could be in a Swiss bank account by the time now along comes to pay back so it's a lot of current pay that back then is\nWhat is it a lot of just one of the issues ... is one of the issues um and even if it's not corrupt it tends to be very uh non transparent on that as a people of the country rarely get any kind of a direct say or even know you know necessarily what their government is is putting an end for isn't\nWorth okay so Greece's debt crisis is it better or worse\nHave to be directly responses to the will of the people I Do think they have to be to some extent in the long term responsive to the will of the people that are or they have to\nHave to tell her to reinforce that says screw you people don't care what you're saying but democracies you think of as it would be built in mechanisms that make the government responses to the will of the people so is it worse for democracies as opposed to ... dictatorial states\nAt all [noise] well I think it can be very problematic for or or even for democracy is um there is a category sometimes people refer to odious debt I think you know a dictator borrows money and use it to a lot of the wrong people very hard to see that as in any way you know ethical up that people should have to pay it back [noise]\nUm it's not just as well to proceed on everything should be fine um what democracy is have a a leads a have wide ranges of any quality that people with more power less power a democracy can easily oppress minority right\nUm it's not like democracy is are you know cigarettes are all fair and equal you know even in democratic societies who pays and who you know profits from alone can be very\nIt's a fraught situation you're listening to philosophy talk we're talking about the ethics of international debt we'd love to have you join this conversation learned does your thoughts and will be forever indebted to you and Lisa from San Francisco's ... drug Lisa what's your comment or question for\nUs yes my comment is um well I my mother was Chilean and that the whole brain works that and the way the media has captured the issue of that I was saying that if the irresponsible countries and things like that are completely forgets that\nEconomic there's an economic terrorism also applied by these financial institutions against\nA emerging democracies the ones that that was the socialist democracies that happen in ... during the year and the government what he had his credit cut off by the world bank\nAnd in fact I'm for example John Perkins who was the chief economist at an international consulting firm where he worked to get by the world bank\nThe IMF U.S Treasury department he wrote a book called confessions of an economic hit man when he tells very specifically about how these financial institutions are actually ruined the country's economies the ones that they were saving money from um you know most in the post colonial or near colonial countries\nAnd by by ruining their national industry is making it impossible for them to even pay back loans to begin with two horses I think they\nThat are controlled by major powers in well\nThanks for the call is you know that's a lot better for two to respond to what ... what do you think ... I mean what are you in ... leader has a lot of thought there would be do whatever you want what\nI I had been talking about things from the get decided to recede in countries that that that very simple story that creditor lender contract ah also doesn't hold up very well from the a side giving allowance I also mentioned already mentioned down expert promotion has nothing to do is to you know the wellbeing of the country and not\nReally a lot about an expectation of being paid back and you think when countries loan money or multilateral institutions uh ... yeah lend money they want to get that interests back\nUh doesn't seem to be the case there seems to be as as the caller referred to a lot of um use of debt at the way the getting control over a country and being able to bully it frankly\nI'm so you I mean so you think I mean some people the people have mixed views about the IMF in it and the world bank some people really do think of those as sort of\nDidn't things in life history [noise] you can give them to their bed and fees [noise]\n\n\n\n\nWow everyone wants money everyone needs money but when nations have to borrow money often becomes a crippling debt\nI'm John Perry this is philosophy talk to a program that questions everything except your intelligence I'm going to I Want money with no interest or just ... author of economics for humans and we're thinking about the ethics of international debt\nOkay Julie here comes the opportunity of a lifetime we're going to make use ... for a day of the whole world all the economy and everything [noise]\nA drinker for however long it takes to get to do with the international debt crisis so what's the first thing you're going to do\nUh get I get to do several things right now right [laughter]\nThe first thing has to do with with the debt cancelation which is the thing that can be done uh immediately but but he's really a band aid for the longer run situation as long as there's an irresponsible lending going on and irresponsible borrowing or or borrowing ... being done under pressure\nUm the problem is going to continue to the other two things that need to happen is um [noise] one for the poor country to shift in the way that that age is given\nA right now a lot of you know seemingly humanitarian aid has given in terms of loans\nAs I said let alone have to be paid back with interest and not only that they'd be paid back usually in dollars or euros or whatever that the lending currency was and you're not going to get that kind of pay back all over you know from from a very basic health\nReferred to a few times that's that's that's you know better structure for the international financial system the way we don't have the wild west out there that there are orderly ways to settle you know essentially international bankruptcy without you know total lack of disorder and agrees case\nI think if you ask them a lot of Americans are making this poll up but I think it's true I think if you were to ask this is how philosophers do things a counterfactual polls I think if you were to ask most American whether foreign aid is\nLike charity just a gift or a lone I'm with interest I bet you most Americans think that foreign aid is again that's why they're so that's why they're so opposed to why are we giving so and so and so until all this foreign aid when we got all this problem but that's most foreign aid is mostly in the ... is that not through foreign aid is\nMostly what on how to fix in front of me but there there's a substantial chunks are in front of loans or um you know when it is a grant grant may be very much tied to um you know maybe in the form of weapons or other things\nAs the United nations or any of its agencies ever taken a stand against is completely what seems to me completely various idea\nOf of ah loaning money on the condition that to you by weapons [noise] ah on\nThat specific issue I'm not sure let me I'm going there had been some efforts at from the UN agencies to to try to get to some better financial structures on some ways out of a structure and renegotiation of sovereign debt\nI Want to know about the only thing I Want to have back up to what you said about inter irresponsible\nBorrowing on Monday Night because it that irresponsibility responsibilities kind of in the eye of the beholder suppose I'm a policymaker\nA decision maker and a high level and the government\nI I'm not like a banker who views are not necessarily like a banker who are ... who views the return on investment necessarily in monetary terms but I may I may realize you could come for Twenty years down the road there's going to be a problem with getting this money back but\nThat is for ... lending is for me an instrument of broader public policy I may get this guy on my side in the battle against the comedies or whatever and yeah you know I don't know if you're going to do with it and if I ever going to get it back going I may not get it back but it's worth it to me to get to\nTake to get him to do my political ...\nBroader policy aims that are not necessarily tied to adjust the economics of of of what are you gonna get the money back\nI Would argue that very large part of it I mean a very large chunks of mountains have you know real reasonable expectation that they could be paid back again they're going into things that are not going to have you know pay back in hard currency\nThey're going to export credits which is more about selling things from that that giving country than than helping or creating a productive capacity and they're receiving one where they were about um you know gaining control and being able to put in a various kinds of you know a neo liberal policies like the I Am\nSo if if the lender lending nations are thinking of that is that way as an instrument of policy rather than just a financial transaction let's let let's\nCall it then in ... it it's an instrument of control\nAnd then that's what it is it's not just mentioned in the pot policy it's an instrument of power that said if I can do this I can get the power over this country\nOr to make them do things my way so I don't know maybe ... percent and that would be a good yeah and you know maybe it's a corrupt country and I'm trying to clean things up or maybe I just want to open that country's markets you know to a bunch of them I don't want to private companies on by my cronies\nWho what I'm Wondering is so suppose I'm now suppose I'm a citizen and I'm thinking about my country in the world as a as a lender right and I'm thinking about money should I object\nBecause should I object to my country wanting to exercise its power to this\nIs the kind of subversive corrosive instrument or should I say on moral grounds because I stand with the party of humanity don't do that country I mean I'm not opposed to an international market that it's a free and fair market\nBut manipulate I'm just trying to figure out how I as a citizen should think about my country that does this stuff I Want you to help\nTell our leaders to not do this stuff [laughter] right I mean I think there is a real moral and ethical issue here um when we're talking about doing the kinds of a financial arrangements here that end up um really bullying and impoverishing or other a weaker countries\nSo Julian ... another debt crisis it's getting a lot of news lately and I would my ten grandchildren I think about it alive [laughter] is this student debt crisis on that that Bernie is going to take care of him and Hillary is not going to quite take care of so completely is burning\nAnd the Republicans are I guess going to pretty much ignored or does it have some\nSimilarities with the international debt crisis\nThe whole thing to do is pay back the debt because of you know it was entered into wrestling with good information all of that again breaks down um [noise]\nThe levels of debt that students are getting into now are are quite incredible um the idea that uh you know an Eighteen year old is going to be able to mortgage away their life you know we know the brain is not quite\nYou know fully formed at that age and you were telling people to you know that they have the right yeah that that they should do this\nAnd working at a university I Know that a lot of the um ah the kind of going to now oh yeah we can raise tuition and fees will just raise the financial aid packages buy what does that mean alone aspect to it becomes a way of expanding a universities expanding um you know administrators salaries\nAre all of these kinds of things I'm On the backs of students\n[noise] yeah so you know but I I'm of many minds about this stuff and I I mean I don't I still hear them any handed he kind of thing but I still don't think a debt is trending lending and borrowing is intrinsically bad and not Shakespeare got it wrong in the Bible\nI mean because it does take money from here and put it over there\nI don't know you don't actually go to the student debt was not a bad idea okay um it is true that if a college degree you know if you get some skills along the way and if the market is is favorable to you will increase your you're earning power\nAt a reasonable amount of debt for that is not a bad idea what we're getting into now is another one of these kind of you know bubbly crisis kinds of things where there's an extreme amount of lending\nAnd um that part about getting the skills and going into a market you know it's becoming weaker right now the quality of our education is going down and get it going up outrageous tipping at some point to where it's\nGoing to I mean some threats or some kind of desert clearly kind of stupid right debt to finance consumption mirror consumption says you ought to be careful about that right threat that that builds your capacity for productive activity that will return on investment I Will that will enable you to\nTo ... more than the interest you have to pay back that's a darn good thing or can be a direct thing that's the kind of debt that can be good right so the question how do we make a society a world can we well let's put it this way can we make us as a nation or a world in which the debt is regulated that way I mean is it possible", "show_name": "Innovation Hub", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "21"}
