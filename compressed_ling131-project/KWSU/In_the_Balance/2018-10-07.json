ocean as the board or and of course wind blowing around in circles turban\nHurricane Florence maybe a steam engine but it's one that's the size of a small country and it huddling across the Atlantic to the east coast\nThese tombs stops thousands of miles away in the Sahara Desert it's tiny disturbances in the flow of hothead streams west from that you may have come across the idea of the butterfly effect that the tiny nation of the butterfly flaps its wings in one part of the world creates massive consequences somewhere else\nIt's he's in popular culture the metaphor but from what the scientists it's morally true\nMeteorologists always talk about how butterfly flaps its wings in Omaha can make it ran in Beijing two weeks from now\nHurricanes in the U.S tend to start in a similar fashion with small disturbances in the ... coup waves\nAnd you get these waves that come across the car and Senegal about every four days\nAnd every one is ... could turn into something\nSo you got Seventy or eighty or those during the course of the time when it's possible to make a hurricane ten percent or a little more grow into hurricanes most of them don't live up to their potential\nThe other thing harkens need warms the will to that very particular recipe\nAn ocean surface where you have water that's twenty eight thirty Celsius going down fifty sixty meters huge amount of heat store does not water and that's what the hurricane Web so\nThese days the scientists in the U.S at least its own monitoring hurricanes which help scientists predict what's going to happen when a storm like Florence hits the coastline surely ... is the deputy director of knows hurricane research division and explains how the organization's mission has changed quite a bit\nStarted way back when with a project called project storm theory the purpose of that what's to stop hurricanes we thought that we could use silver iodide too if you will sprinkle it over the hurricane and maybe stop the conviction from happening\nThat doesn't necessarily work for us and so we got more involved with trying to improve the forecast by going over that started when people said\nOh a hurricane's coming is it just they tell by looking out the window\nSatellites and that was around the early Nineteen sixties and that gave us sort of a picture of what was to come to our coast but since then we've been improving the forecast what kinds of tools to use to track how can\nWe use as I mentioned satellites we use the aircraft to collect data overland we'd we launch radio sons bitter weather balloons\nWe have buoys out in the ocean we also use coastal radars so we use all those those things in a public improve of how we can monitor the hurricane I'm a motor they all doing they're gathering wind speed wind direction pressure\nA relative humidity all of those things and with all of that data that we can collect even the radar gives her sort of a reflectivity which is a signal of how strong or how deep news of thunder storms and hurricanes are\nAnd you've got on the table in front of us well it looks like a ... percent poster inside\nWhat is it it is a drop one son does a GPS drop one son and we drop about twenty five from the belly of the aircraft into the storm and so we sort of pepper the storm with aids instruments asking or their\nHorns Hurricane Florence making landfall who would\nKnow some of you might wonder how TV weather forecast this notion that much about how the woman's behaving\nOnly just seemed it was all done remotely but no uh no civic comes down to they drop suns send them to show you mentioned which have to be physically dropped out the plane into a storm we started the show on board just plain\nParts nearly two hundred miles north east of the storm center and\nIt's cold and guns I Know in name only ... off the Muppets and aside from cramped science it stops boiling meteorologist\nPower fed and Tony technicians Terry ... showed me how to release the drums\nBoth both straight out\nTo watch each song to power sheets through the storm into the sea measuring the weather at that particular point in the plane that checking to make sure everything's working\nOut into the drops on his grandmother's drops on\nBoard and they look for is all these and one drink greenish good\nEvery ten minutes Harry Dana print and one of these cemented and Kathleen ... into a machine\nAlready this year my one of the ocean will know that\nBBC ...\nThem to go and read the words I get\nA heads up on my ... my family\nAnd then it's time to launch the\nWho you are listening to the BBC Web service doing science where such on a plane I think we've its way through a hurricane why because this is crowded on the program that when he goes the extra mile or in this case forty five thousand feet to answer you will find queries [noise]\nWeather predictions are really important to help people on land prepared for the battering but listen to\nKelly wants to know if we can control weaken the stove\nWe heard earlier that to make a hurricane you need very particular conditions for one you need the ocean water to be more than twenty six degrees Celsius it might sound implausible but what if you could cook the seat to stop a superstorm\nBefore we came out to Florida we paid a visit to Stephen sofa and America is professor at the University of Edinburgh he told us that is exactly what he plans to date and he began by working out how much colder he'd need to make the sea to have an effect\nI think every engineering projects you stole ground bussing all the energy to take in the area for America to the Caribbean and multiply the bus or stimulus to ... to ... how much do we need to ... to buy 'em so two degrees or breeder central number\nTwo degrees might not sound like much but we talking a vast area here that don't even go to Steven mentioned imagine the entire United States so much to sixty me is it that much if you could talk for a fridge to cool it down it would take a huge amount of energy\nWhich follows terms ten to twenty ... years thinking about it is the ... of electrical generation in America comes out as are the six hundred times about\nSix hundred times the ...\nBut professor so tight lipped problem a different way why is the ocean woman the first place it takes a huge amount of energy to heat up that much water that comes from the sun shining down on the oceans\nAt noontime and read some others about Thirteen sixty waltz ... coming in to the top of the atmosphere so what we need to do is to reflect a tiny bits of this
