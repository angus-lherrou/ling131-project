need to kind of professors yesterday you did yeah\nI think like me and she printed a couple of them out of mom and your brother is\nA\n... yeah I just wonder if the United states [noise] comfortable which is you know on on a stick to it I think it's similar wishing it on somebody when you're not going to be able to change their life bring up something about supporting king about that\nBut would you want it so easy for me to just don't do that Rob ... to to not do that\nRachel mentor role in national thing to do and when you do and to not check 'em your what he's going to be changing something in your house to the nation and during that\nThanks to Sophie page on no thanks to my easily inclined to produce the mo for that to mean trick\nNow I'm going to go out on a limb and say that most of you wouldn't be too keen on stabbing does or cutting pictures of your loved ones either but it was a bit surprised by how strong ... version was even though I knew Russian either nothing would actually come of it I just couldn't bring myself to cut up the picture\nTo what's going on here how can something that we know isn't true still have an impact on the way we behave entered Jane rise and professor of behavioral science at Chicago universities Booth School of business and an expert in magical thinking my\nWay of thinking about this is that a lot of these superstitious intuitions and beliefs are really just a product of how our minds work and so this is just how people think about the world and we're not perfect when we try to think about the world\nSo where did he superstitious or choose to kind of belief come from do you think that we have them for some kind of evolutionary like reason\nThink that they are building on psychological process fees and those are functional and they exist for a reason I don't necessarily believe that the superstitious beliefs are\nHere for a reason so for example or always searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen we are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not\nSo even when things are random even when things are correlated we see them as actually being quarterly related that ends up leading to superstitious beliefs that is especially powerful in moments when you're experiencing uncertainty and tension and stress\nAnd so in those moments you're going to be desperate for anything that you can do to potentially control a scary environment right yeah that makes sense or another example is the way that she respects or sort of the rules of thumb that our mind will rely on so it's a a rule of thumb that way\nTo determine how likely are common it is so lots of times things that are recent or emotional or vivid come to mind very easily and so we think of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program in ... there was a bit in the museum about very do and um but producing over cruelly brought along some pictures of my son loved ones and I was off to forward like cutting them up or just she couldn't bring myself to do it oh just searching you with the outcome of anything but up next to them\nWhat you're describing now is building on a different ... which is known as either representative ... are sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of the lake now if you just drew a smiley face and said could you cut this that doesn't seem so problematic it's that it's the actual representation\nOf your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connection between two things that look so much alike and that is part of where the mood to believe comes from it's again building on basic building blocks of the way our minds work\nI'm sort of asking the question why do ordinary people have these beliefs even in pretty ordinary circumstances right they seem to show up and lots of places lots of the time\nAnd so that's why I've been very interested in seeing how a very basic kind of dual processed model can be used to understand superstition too which is the idea that there are two sort of sets of mental systems are in our mind one that operates\nVery quickly in automatically and doesn't require any cognitive resources\nOr sort of working memory load and and another that is slow and deliberate and does require are sort of attention and deliberate working memory\nAnd the fast process can kind of give rise to an intuition\nAnd the slower process can then come in and determine whether or not it makes sense and correct the air\nAnd what I suggest in my work is that when it comes to superstitions and magical thinking that that's not always the case sometimes that slow system recognizes the error recognizes that the intuition is wrong and then maintain that anyway\nTo illustrate how these two men two systems ... we're going to do a thought experiment I Want you to imagine this I have three of ... on the table and one of them you know which has some money in\nChosen okay good now you can keep people and for loop or you can swap it for the remaining to him but look what you guys will usually go for the two [laughter] no question here rationally what you should do\nBut a lot of people have the feeling well I chose that first one what we find that that it's not that people think that there are ... more likely to win but where this tempting fate believe comes is that people believe that if they were to trade it\nThen it would become more likely to win a this is where the magic comes and so\nThey're torn between an intuition where they shouldn't trade there aren't below and the rational knowledge that they should we find that a large minority of them I said around like forty percent of them will stick with one novel up\nWhile I'm like a really high number and so\nWhat you're saying there is that that kind of choice that between the intuition and and then the rational kind of oversight they kind of represent these two different systems in our brain and an sometimes the rational system will win out but other times we kind of I guess given for the first in Jewish and system just because\nJust because of some kind of a rational belief\nThat's right and that's what we refer to as acquiescence when they follow that\nIntuitive belief even while recognizing that it's not a rational thing to do what we do know is that the more powerful the intuition is the more likely you are to follow it do another thing to consider is the cost of ignoring your rational side or ignoring your intuition\nSo much ... than the idea of the costs I explain my experience with the new do so\nYou know the cost of ignoring my rational system is very small I mean maybe I sound like Saudi rational person on the radio but the cost of ignoring the intuition that I see this is going to be really positive I ... through a picture of a loved one that's the big cost so I'd rather avoid not do it\nYeah I think that's a perfect illustration the only thing that I Would add to that description there is to just say that the reason you're having an emotional reaction in the first place is because there is some sort of superstitious intuition underlying it\nI mean not even just to the extent that you're entertaining at as a possibility Jane writes in that\nAre
