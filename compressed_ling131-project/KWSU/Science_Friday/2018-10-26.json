[noise] I'm ... and you are listening to northwest public broadcasting\nI'm Ira Flatow might grow plastics\nYou know it seems like just yesterday that environmental scientists were raising the alarm about the tiny bits of plastic and face wash and now these tiny invisible polymer particle\nSheep to have worm their way into everything else on her our water or shellfish\nEven our beer perhaps there was only a matter of time before we found them in ourselves that's right we are full of micro plastics and you know explain more and try to but others like the subjects in science\nIs popular science senior editors Sophie Bush with\nHis best to have you back nice to be here so when we're when we go let's talk about this where exactly to the researchers find these micro plastic\nSo researchers um they had a group of eight subjects I'm from countries all over Europe and Asia and essentially had these subjects keep a food diary for a week and then at the end of the week they were they took it to sample from themselves and sent it to the researchers then then the researchers had the sun job picking through that\nThey were looking for ten different types of plastic and they found these these plastic types they've done nine of them and they were in all of the samples still samples so they'll write for our bodies yep we eat them and then we send about the other end [noise]\nOnly a matter of time right with all the micro plastics that are around\n... researchers that's on micro plastics and tap water in the er it's in seafood um because a lot of these plastic fragments get into the waterways and then ... them and we eat the fish\nOr the other thing is that all you know a lot of us drink water from plastic bottles or food out of plastic pick out containers are that's been wrapped in plastic and there's all sorts of chances for fragments to come off so the definition of a micro plastic is that it's smaller than\nFive millimeters but it can be much much smaller than that you know some of these fragments or on the nano meter scale\nAnd and we suspect that there's no harm coming from the\n... very difficult to tell you because it it's hard to sort of parsed out um you can't really feed people some people plastic samples and not be the other people plastic samples at this point it's just man not actively\nFeasible but um ... maybe they're just passengers harmlessly it's also possible that they could be accumulating\nAnd that um a lot of these plastics carry chemicals that they may reach into the human body so it it's I wouldn't tell people I Would say don't don't panic because it could be yes it could be harmless but it's very difficult to another of those of us\nSome good news though maybe eating organic vegetables is linked to less cancer [noise]\nThat's right a study in France they looked at seven almost Seventy thousand people they had them I answer a survey how often they had organic food and whether they had cancer\nAnd then the researchers followed up and five years to check and again on whether they had developed cancer and they also took a lot of other information such as how often they they drink or smoke\nOn whether how often eat fruits and veggies how much they exercise and also their income level what they found is with us a couple of specific types of cancer like non Hodgkin's lymphoma and post menopausal breast cancer people who eat organic did have less of the risk of developing the cancer\nToo so it wasn't actually tied to the vegetables themselves or could have been those kind of lifestyle you live if you eat organic vegetables it's\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow Halloween is right around the corner and when you think of this spooky holiday what comes to mind right goes ... and of course\nBlood him a

common along with miles\n[laughter] see very ah they're all the different connotation the by the Romans drank it Homer used it in the odyssey to allow the day to speak why there's so many almost mystical ideas about what [noise]\nI think because there's such a long time it wasn't really understood neo anything it was understood was that when you saw it was probably a very bad thing\nBecause it was usually followed by injury and death so obviously it was a really powerful substance [noise] um [noise]\nBut it wasn't really understood ferry while until the last hundred hundred and fifty years so it was given this power because if if it could\nKill you so easily when you left it then obviously if he drank it till he will homeless mother you can't get a bit of sheep's blood because she

a pipeline would be an artery and they're stuck with me ever since and I'm so happy to you you mentioned that because it really put it on the radar screen for me\nYeah I mean I just can't I Can't even remember how I came across a bit I was a much much happier pass and once I had I mean it's it's slightly eccentric shall we call it the film but it's it's just wonderful and\nIt's got it's got the poetry Scott Matheson it's got science has got everything and it's yeah I I it's very hard to describe though I mean once you've seen 'em\n... listening to his being compared to railroads which meant it yeah it's quite and indescribable filmed up really was looking up\nLike the early days of television quite indescribable and pretty good in some of the things that they did was talking about uh the taboos about blood you visited India where there's a man trying to break this taboo tell us about that [noise]\nThis is a guy called his show to name is Maria guy he's got a long time I'll\nName he's from South India and I'm a lot of Indians will know him better as pat man because there's been a Bollywood film about him about his story is extraordinary he was in a very poorly educated um young man and his wife came home one day\nHiding something behind her back and he ah he thought she was teasing and they had a bit of a tussle and she eventually\nUm showed him that she was carrying a bloody menstrual Iraq so a lot of Indian women use cloth they don't have ... they don't caught food sanitary pads conventional punish pets I've ... like millions of other Indian women on across the developing world was using cloth\nThere's nothing wrong with that if you can clean and I'm wash it Hi Jeannie clay but because of taboos that often doesn't happen\nAnyway ... I'm a shanty why she couldn't afford 'em commercial than she pads because he'd seen them in the market and she said well it's either a sandwich pad or milk and we need\nMilk and from that I'm\nGood because he's a bit of an extraordinary fellow um spent twelve years coming up with a low cost sanitary pads machine\nThat can be money they'll practice it can be afraid to pilot ... women are now four thousand of them all over 'em all over the world but the way he got to understanding he had to do a reverse engineering to understand what was in commercial than if you pass because he thought it was just ... yeah\nIn the form of um [noise] a a a goat plaza filled with a ... blood\nAnd I'm Sorry yeah there was a football field at ... slogan blood and he attached it to his clothing and had little pump and once around all day and every so often pumped it and so I tried to simulate the experience of a men's dressing woman and he learned a lot [laughter]\nBelow what if they did that [laughter] and and also\nBecause he lived in South India where it's hot he uh he was wearing white so which is pretty much everyone is nightmare no matter what sounds you pad advertising has told us over the years and so you know there was stains and leaks in east are a lot of times checking behind themselves like women do a lot and um\nHe eventually came understood what was inside pets and has revolutionized sun spots in India quite an amazing fellow\nAmazing so it's a very you know more men should try that out to make sure how to travel tribulations\nOf what women go ask him with football [laughter] I I think there's so many great little moments in your book on a little statistics that just jumps out let me go through a few of them\nYou have a staff that every three seconds someone received a blood transfusion wow ... ... you know the joke behind that is they ought to find that guy and stop him from\n[laughter] but it's I have in the states is that she every two seconds is that right yeah and uh I was given the breakdown of the biggest idle idle makes sense\nAh how how did this idea of banking blood first come about\nWell what I mean we haven't been this the system that we're all used to which is the mass donation and I'm supply transfusion of blood it's really not very old until it's about a hundred and Twenty years old and in the beginning I'm In the U.S in the u._k. they\nThey ... they started in pretty similar fashion that people who are selling that blood um\nThey have to put it that they could sell them on and so they did when I was even a union of blood cell of in New York\nAnd there are people who men usually who traveled around the country I'm selling that blood so they're with their own kind of blood market um but eventually in the Nineteen thirties uh adult to in Chicago called ... I'm\nTrying to organize things a bit better and he was\nConvinced that the best thing to do 'em ... blood as a commodity really so he thought that went in ...\nAnd I'm actually that transformed I'm In the Nineteen seventies in in the u._s. um the notion of paying full blood um died out and now a whole donate to actually illegal to sell your blood in the U.S but it's just it's just frowned upon and not done\nOne of the you know I when I was in college I knew lots of college students who were selling their blood for for money just you know for to have some spending cash\nWhere you can still do that but you you what you're doing is selling blood plasma and so you're selling the yellow stuff fifty five percent of liquid in your blood and um\nYeah you can do that the u._s. has got very very generous regulations that house and you can do that can do it twice a week if you want to know other countries on ... plasma\nDuring his do it every couple of weeks but um yeah you can and so the fifty dollars a pop selling a plasma to us so yeah it's a good income stream for other people\nAnd now you're right that that the U.S is seen as the old pack of plasma [laughter] like where it is a cartel of plasma well\nDoes that wasn't my phrase that came from somebody in the classroom or industry but it's it's certainly a global giant and and the selling off last night it's a tie Seventy percent of\nPlasma or a ... foot ... plasma products so what happens to ... it can\nEither be used for transfusions or it can be a refined them ... and become Mets medicinal products so um what the us does is it exports a lot of a plasma which has turned into plastic products around the world because it takes so much plasma to\nGet a single product on other countries just don't have enough of it right because we're not paying people to um donated twice a week probably\nNow we don't get that the blood comes from many different types but I never realized how many types of blood\nIt's science friday I'm Ira Flatow figure the breath through your nose short cut deep into your brain ... notice anything different other than maybe how the rooms smell [noise]\nRecent study suggests that breathing through your nose can be linked to improve memory\nAnd that's a new to hold on view mouth breather out there to untangle how olfaction is linked to deeper parts of the brain controlling emotion and memory is Christine is on the professor at Northwestern University Feinberg school of medicine doctors on and welcome to science friday\nHi thank you I'm happy to be here we're happy to have you so what is so special about breathing through your nose\nWell a nose breathing is special because it's how we smell and smell is a fascinating and really unique sensory system\nSo evolutionarily smell is our oldest sense it's also arguably the least understood of our sensory systems and there are several key aspects of smell that make it particularly interesting and that make nose breathing really different from mouth breathing so for one thing\nThat smell neurons which live up way up at the very top of our nasal cavities\nThey actually touch the air as it flows in and out of our noses\nOnly part of our central nervous system that makes direct contact with our ex terminal world\nAnd the way that this information get from these neurons inside of our noses\nInto the brain is different from all other sensory systems so all other sensory systems information relays through a structure called the thalamus before it reaches the cortex and higher order brain areas\nBut in the olfactory system information flows straight from the nose into the cortex and higher order brain areas as well without going through the thalamus um and what special is that the ... olfactory structures are located in a part of the brain called the Olympics system\nWhich is involved and emotion and fear learning and memory so this gives a faction of sort of privileged access to emotion and memory areas in the brain and and because a nose breathing is smelling\nNasal inhalation provide some sort of entry point by which breathing rhythm can modulate brain activity in these structures\nSo just the act of breathing through your nose was your nose also saying the air is coming in and they just passed away on me and point in your brain and say something interesting it was about to happen\nRight it yes actually it does so that the receptors inside of the nasal cavity\nOr not only responsive to chemicals because they're not only monitoring a the chemicals in our environment but they also are that can of receptors so they can detect the air flowing in and out of the\nThe nose yes [noise] um and we found that these natural respiratory rhythms just breathing even in the absence of any smell\nOf drives activity in olfactory areas but interestingly these these respiratory driven brain waves they don't stop there\nSo we found that they also propagate to do nearby limbic structures the the ones involved and emotion and memory so what this means is that as we breathe\nActivity across the Olympics system is rhythmically increasing and decreasing with inhale and exhale um and this pattern what we found is that it's only present when you're breathing through your nose so if you breathe through your mouth that rhythmic limbic activity goes away\nYou know a lot of uh\nYou remember from Thirty years ago right is is that a ... a real thing or a ... and I'm a well for me it's real but why is that something special tobacco juice sensory Oregon\nUh yeah you know the evidence is not clear that studies sort of conflicting on that\nUm a couple of studies have found that perhaps olfactory memories memories tend to be earlier I'm not necessarily stronger [noise] um but I Would say there's no clear consensus on on whether or not that's true\n... one of ... ... what about breathing through your mouth and not do anything for you I mean [noise] uh we we use as far as tasting food we've always been told that you smell the food through your nose and it helps your taste buds of taste what it what you're actually doing is there a connection there\nRight that is true that is a good point um and that's that's what's called retro nasal olfaction so when when we have food inside of our mouth\nI'm the era can get from our oral cavity into our nasal cavity but it flows and the backwards direction so it's going out word rather than in word um and it definitely impacts\nFlavors and and taste yes us\nTo talk about your study how were you able to study this I understand that you were able to test is within Iraq [noise]\nOh actually I'm no that's an and that's a very interesting point um we did not use that summer I because in the human brain the olfactory structures are actually located\nVery very deep almost in the center of the brain and making them very hard to reach noninvasive leave so we can't record from these areas from electrodes on the surface of the scalp\nAnd functional neuro imaging uh we cannot really measure\nUm brain oscillation with that technique so to do this study we worked in collaboration with brain surgeons who implant electrodes wires directly into these Olympic areas for patients who are undergoing brain surgery for epilepsy\nAnd this provides just a really rare opportunity to record this type of data\nFrom human olfactory Olympic structures\n[laughter] if it's all faction and memories are related to you see people with memory problems also having issues with smell [noise]\nThat that's a really good point\nShe declined um and well I think are\nThese findings that we're discussing or may not have direct implications for nerve degenerative disease I think um [noise]\nThe impact of of breathing on limbic activity certainly suggests potential new avenues and directions of research on on these diseases for example it you know it'd be interesting to know if these mechanisms may be altered in near a degenerative disease um and I I also think\nThat our data point to the possibility that neurodegenerative disease could result in all altered nasal breathing patterns I'm breathing is so easy to measure\nAnd it's something that we're looking into and in the lab so do um patients with different neurological disorders do they breathe differently do they have characteristic nasal breathing patterns\nAnd so that's something you know you're going to be following up we're right yes I Am doing any neurodegenerative disease in particular [noise]\nUh we're we're currently collecting breathing data from patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with Parkinson's disease to see if we can differentiate the two um states just by analyzing the shapes of their breeding waveform\nNormally the only and I'm going to just throw to talk of some really dumb [laughter] are I mean why do we need to breathe through our mouths if we have our noses and are we the only animals are breathing through our mouth\nYeah you know I I really I mean are there are a great question and I spent a lot of time thinking about that actually I\nI mean I think the answer probably goes far beyond just sort of immediate thought which is that if your nose is congested you have this alternate breathing route so that you can still get Aaron and still live in one that was vital fungal and um\nBut we're finding that it really drastically changes our brain activity so I think that\nThe full answer to that question really remains to be seen and I think it's a really interesting point I Know that\nUm well most mammals that that I can think of do\nPaint and parenting is is typically something that involves mouth breathing so dogs pant not only when they're hot but I think also when they're stressed uh cats as well and I think that's um something interesting about that because mouth breathing\nAnd that well we actually asked me intelligence question [laughter] that's what you'll come back\nWhen you have

I don't know what\nSpace exploration will uncover but I don't think it'll be explore a singer for the sake of exploration\nI think it will be more of the fact that it\nAllows us to see things\nMaybe we should have seen a long time ago\nIt hadn't been able to until now\nMm that's actor Ryan Gosling playing astronaut Neil Armstrong in the new movie first man he's talking about why he wants to be part of the Gemini missions astronaut crew\nWhich will later on down the lands in the first human to pet food set foot on the surface of the moon and we've gathered a solar panel of space nerds to\nFriendly maples and there was some areas in the film we want to hear from you if you if you could make a movie about space exploration\nWhat story would you want to town and is it a common stories we hear the famous ones\nWhat about some on famous people are famous stories\nThat could be from the space race or right now at any decade your life give us a call\nOur number is eight four forest tipping too for eight to five five eight four four tie talk you can also tweet us\n... fry let me introduce my guest Miriam Kramer a science editor at Nashville welcome to science friday hey thanks for having me and ... she is a human exploration mission and analysis lead at NASA's Johnson Space center in Houston Welcome to New York thank\nYou good afternoon nap\nAnd I seem to to ... he's a he's a history professor studying space exploration at Fordham University his most recent book is beyond earth to chronicle of deep space exploration nice to have you nice to be here [noise]\nSpoiler alerts [laughter] that's it we're deep diving into the movie and that means we'll be talking about the key plot points\nIncluding yes does Neal Armstrong make it safely back to the moon and back if you don't know that much [laughter] we'll get we're going to be giving that away so if you want to take part in a number eight full force having to for eight to five five\nOr you can also reach us at science friday I'm very much to start with the review thumbs up or thumbs down\nOh I loved it you know I'm In the tape for this movie I really liked the first man at actually I said that's a kind of surpassed my previous favorites based movie uh and and now in the top spot above Apollo Thirteen\nRally yeah pretty I pray yeah I really I really enjoyed it I thought that it was sort of the space movie that uh that we needed\nIn a lot of ways why what do you mean we needed Garfield good movies [laughter] and not so much more uh I really enjoy the tone of it like I I just wanted for a long time ah for there to be some kind of darker look at face history and I think that that's kind of\nGave it to us in a lot of different ways from like the ... not all of the ship to let it ever launching I thought I was you know I Would rent or you\nCan as it was ... you know get an idea how the rattling I'm which vibration that really was and\nIt like ... I felt that um and just also like looking at the portrayal of masculinity and\nAnd the truth when did you think\nAbout a personal level I really enjoyed it for me it's the first person aspect versus just sort of watching it from the outside you can really put yourself in the movie and you know most of us will never get to fly in space so getting to actually experience it in a way I was really a fun way to have that movie made\n[laughter] except for throughout the film we see Neal Armstrong as a dispassionate mhm reserved contained and that was all part of his engineering mindset here's an here's a clip\nSigning a summer job or is it a new bus tour with fellow wouldn't want to give his wife bragging rights [noise]\nNeal when you take anything a set of choices they were\nI think that's a real quote [laughter] do you ... you know right I did I did I I met him once I'm at a conference so I think you know the movie it really does justices character in a way by ... I liked the movie quite a bit it's a it's a flood movie but it's really great movie\nI really think this is a a movie that captures the other side of the right stuff so to speak to engineering technical backgrounds and the kind of commitment these guys needed to have beyond just be fighter drunks and\nAnd that kind of internal narrative internal I'm kind of story in this in this movie about what it took to be an astronaut\nI think really is communicated really effective which he has reserved as you went as you knew him well I didn't really I don't think any of that well but from what I understand he was very reserved but he was not I think as perhaps Dower is portrayed in the movie\nOr you had a sense of humor he was a funny guy but I Do think he had a lot of struggles in his life and as his biographer Jim Hansen has talked about a\nUm you know there were some serious problems struggles in his family life and also with his colleagues and ask for an office so you know I think it's a bit of both you was I think he was he was a bit of perhaps reticent but um but I think he was also a capable of just being kind of chilling out [laughter]\nYou know you didn't get that impression too much in the movie not so much in the movie but I think the movie was focused on those aspects of his career in life that required concentration and diligence\nYeah and there's your urine and you're an engineer did you feel like that was a fair portrayal of any engineer\nI engineers have a whole variety of personality so I think he saw a few different personalities that movie and if you look across a lot of movies do you see that there's an engineer and there is a very serious one they're the ones that are cheaper outgoing so it's certainly a fair portrayal because pretty much every personality type exists in engineering\nAnd one thing that struck me about this film was how jarring and ...\n... and it was just disorienting any time we saw people flying or did you is that realistic to you\nI think there was a lot of realistic aspects that you know people are feeling you have this on floating feeling but especially in the Gemini capsule the mercury there wasn't a lot of room\nThat you are really crammed in there the cockpit is right in your face the control panel so I think that with a very accurate portrayal all the switch engages are just right there so that and then of course the rocket ride up ... can be a very bumpy so that was certainly true\nLet's go to the phones Andrew in Sarasota, Florida welcome to science friday\nAndrew are you there oh\nHi Hi Saturday I think I got disconnected there for among [noise] um yeah I was saying it just since you happened to mention the Gemini program we hear a lot about mercury and we hear a lot about a but Apollo but I feel like the Gemini program is under served the first time\nMan stepped out into the void and Americans that space walks I think that's a story worth telling\nHey thanks for that call you know I have a lot of people don't realize you know in that scene in the movie where he can control the orbiting the rotation and he had the right stuff to pull out of that that's why he got the first seat you know to go landing on them oh\nYeah I think that's definitely one of the factors that kind of um [noise] made it much more visible and they asked for an office there were I mean there were other candidates for the job\nBut for sure the Gemini eight experience was a really key point I was a really dangerous missions and I was just looking up all life magazines from that month and it was widely reported that the time as a kind of really a kind of an amazing exciting moment in the space race\nA kind of success or failure in that sense but a ... a fantastic a moment captured really nicely in the movie\nAs the one person in the room who remembers that real in real time I can say that it was very very frightening um uh the the big emotional punch of the story was amused grief over the death of his daughter when she was just two years old and then the last with a fellow astronaut lead up to Apollo you know weapons Apollo one whatever [noise]\nAnd do you think these humans just wants to shape history has has played out and I see [noise] well\nI you know I mean these things or if I I think is also communicate in the movie the fighter pilots test pilots were very familiar with losses because they had been at um air force bases and there are many of their colleagues were I'm not making it back home from test flight so\nIn in many ways they were used to it but nobody's really used to last us like that and especially losing a child is something that nobody can really knowing this happened to them\nEffectively in the movie in a way that I thought it was really poignant and powerful ... you know we really don't usually see the personal side if an astronaut and a lot of films Apollo Thirteen we saw some of it but it was really the the heroes victory of getting back\nRight yeah for me I think a lot of the space on tend to be focused more on on sort of what the country is going through or that the national at an aspect of it and\nThe pride that the people bring to the country um but for me that refreshing part about that movie with that it was really about him it was really about Neal and his struggle and sort of how the name of that kind of hunting him and and that's something that I don't think that\nThe latest updates on Facebook\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking about Neal Armstrong as portrayed in the new movies per se man\nFrom a personal hardships the astronaut over claimed to be jarring dizzying processed astronaut training\nTo have that story led to all the missions and since that time for ... July night of Nineteen sixty nine are my guests are marry him Kramer science editor at a mashable ... human exploration mission analysis lead at NASA's\nJohnson Space center in Houston has been to ... a professor history professor studying space exploration at Fordham his most recent book is beyond earth the chronicle of these deep space exploration our number is eight for for seven to for\nEight to five five we have lots of tweets that came in and let's see what we get sued just a few of them tweet from Glen and says no one knows how much Russia pull up put the first spacecraft into orbit\nFor the first human we did this knowledge come from having to really get us into the space race I asked you at the beginning of the hour to tell us what kind of film you would like to see that hasn't been made it I think that's his visit effort explaining a film he would like to see what's going to the phones for another suggestion\nLet's go to Alan in Cleveland Hi ally welcome to science friday\n[laughter] I Love your show glad to be on the go ahead go ahead I'll yeah go ahead\nOh I Would love for some sort of biopic or something to be done about ... Carroll Janet than um you know there are very few African Americans and space exploration there if you went in\nAnd he was the first African American woman to go into space exploration and not only that she just seems like a like a really cool person outlook and then she'd done dancing and acting\nWith on Star Trek and she graduated high school at sixteen and um you know insurance that they are inspired by the civil rights and the thing I just feel like he's just all around to fill a multifaceted fascinating person to\nGet a movie about and I love to proceed adjusted the something about her\nYou're nodding very much in agreement\nOh yeah I made of incidents it's very cool I've I've met her a few times and it's just always a treat to talk to her about a knife and you tell us a little bit about our history\nUm I I think pretty much what what the college that is what I Know of her as a she's just like like a really interesting life filled with a lot of different things in science to the ... [noise]\nI made you haven't seen it yet are certainly a lot of a background um she flew one\nI think there will be amazing stories or um you know for life is amazing\nThat it is a treat from a tweet from apple says how about the early women astronaut to didn't fly\nOr perhaps what would happen would have happened if they did find something like an interesting topic and there are all these behind the scenes stories right\nNow there are I mean I think um that the mystery that Thirteen rate I so I I they're I Believe with the ... some kind of Netflix theories about about that and also some kind of documentary series that was regarded as\nYeah um [noise] and all the people who were in that control room and all the other places and you know [noise]\nAll kinds of all kinds of stories um interesting ah this this was a movie about the roads have astronaut certainly fifty years ago and it will be fifty years since the moon landing next summer which I'm having trouble getting my head around [laughter]\nAnd we also have Apollo Thirteen we have the right stuff why is Hollywood still talking about things that happen fifty years ago when so much has happened since when are you saying [noise]\nYeah I mean that's a good question I I think part of it is that you know Apollo landing on the moon that was that at the big stuff like that was the big stuff that human exploration has has done in the last\nSeveral years I mean that that shuttle and exciting and incredible but it wasn't as exciting and incredible as like actually going to the moon [laughter] um so I I think that it's it's a deep wells that people keep coming back to you because of that uh\nAnd that that like I think that there are plenty of stories to be told more in the here and now I mean I I think the robots should should get\nThere do you know that's what I mean we were talking about this I said they're all those robots we don't hear any stories about the trials and tribulations getting those robots yeah and there are other places\nAnd you know when we also hear about any stories of any other countries in his basement and there's so many other asked if there are so many countries up there\nRight now I mean there is a story to be told that the tweet about the Russians I think there'll be a an epic story to tell about their chief designer and uh they're they're older travails and difficulties and\nThe space dog like God there's many ways to make her into that story um but I Would say that it's not all looking back in the past if you look at movies like um gravity and the marsh and those are sort of maybe imagining a kind of\nAbout the interest in space in general but I like to believe we're not just looking back rules with imagined in the future\nIs your what do they talk about it now these days about [noise] ah\nSo what what are big project is actually trying to get back to the moon and so that's a bigger Ryan as the last programs and all of exploration systems ballot meant so you know really I think once we can start flying those flights are there will be a whole nother a crop of a story to be told\nAnd one of the things I'd like to see I don't think the general public really understands engineering at how all of these things take to develop so on a personal level I think it'd be great if if someone could figure out how to tell what it takes to actually get\nTo the flight ... for the astronaut to fly on it mhm bend in Mesa, Arizona welcome to science friday\n... thank thank you my name's Ben and uh yeah I I Would think it'd be interesting to make a film about what the challenger accident from an engineering standpoint um they the engineers actually tried to stop the launching a and unfortunately that did not happen\nUm and it and and the effect of them in ways that many people did though of course it affects it killed the crew but oh\nI think that many of the engineers have a story to tell us well\nThat's a good point yeah absolutely I mean that's a ... ah that that will be an amazing story but um I I think there is a plan to make a movie about the challenger mission um but focused on the school teacher Christa McAuliffe but I imagine these\nThe decisions made on the day and the ... the day before the launch which were critical will be depicted in some fashion in the movie which were all engineering decisions and uh\nI'm I'm and I'm sure movies you know a crucial to understanding the accident\nYou knew she was you mentioned the and Ryan mission that wants to get back to the moon is usually going to be easier because of the lessons we learned from Paul\nIn order to know are getting to the moon is just as hard\nToday that was in the Nineteen sixties\nI mean we know a little bit more we have an experience space of one to draw from a but actually going to the moon to the mission is going to be justice risky it's just it's hard to do um that amount of a prop we name when Neal said he wished for more ... I Wish for more prop every day as well\nUm so it's not any easier getting to the moon and it is risky I'm the second time around\nI remember after the ... the Apollo missions were cancelled there were three rockets leftover we only went to Seventeen years was to be twenty I remember going through she used in and seeing them lying on their side one lying and so I did a\nI've been home for you know it's nice to birds at a place in an effort who's the most ... it's in a building now and it's been restored I Know I Know that has been couldn't we just turn that put it back in the video was family building in fact I'm only\n... the avionics are quite out of date that we can control it anymore [laughter] when what's the schedule for that and do we have enough money and is it going to be going\nOut so we're working to uh twenty twenty flight for the first launch of SOS out and really the second lots of uh Ryan we launched in twenty fourteen for the first flight of her eye on 'em and that'll be an unproven flight we are going around the moon or to a different retrograde orbits literally been go way past and then what about Seventy thousand kilometers on the far side\nAnd that will be a long mission is really a shakedown all of the vehicle systems on ... and the Ryan before we put crew on the next flight ... were in progress we have enough money um and it's just a challenge getting their\nBack to the future yes indeed we do that or I Want to thank all of you are for ... for taking time to be able to say it's it's gonna be the fiftieth anniversary next year it's really amazing\nAnd we'll all be looking forward to seeing the mirror and Kramer science editor measurable\nNewton around see of human exploration mission analysis lead at NASA's Johnson Space center in Houston has troops would be a history professor studying space exploration at Fordham University here in the Bronx just his most recent book proud Bronx\nBeyond her at the chronicle of these deep space exploration a thank you all for taking time to be with us today\nThey used to [noise]\n\nWhat's your favorite Beatles song I Want to hold your hand in my life around science friday this is our favorite\n[noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Pullman", "day": "26"}
