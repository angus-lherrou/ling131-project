I had a complicated relationship with climate change it it's been ahead of the industry in acknowledging it's a problem\nThey've had researchers who helped author the IPC the report and yet they are also being sued for misleading people about the impact of fossil fuels ... years ago in in two thousand they took out ads in newspapers\nSaying that the science was not settled I mean should we be taking this seriously or is it just another\nYou know and make us look good sort of thing\nAlways the question isn't it I mean the thing to remember what Exxon is that they are an investor owned company so they do have to answer to their shareholders and they've been getting a lot of ...\nIn terms of their facilities and if they aren't out ahead on this they might get slapped with a carbon policy that they don't like that doesn't actually work in their favor and another way a carbon tax might actually benefit them is that it would target the dirtier fuels first things like coal which would clear some space for one of axons other products natural gas\nAnd of course the catches the things they want to exchange for getting the other environmental regulations rolled back Andy immunity from lawsuits I mean those are all things that benefit the company so yeah this could be viewed as an act of self interest overall\nScience friday I'm Ira Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section is not unusual but what is unusual is that a number of these actions happening all over the world listen to this worldwide rate\nHas nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent in the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se is by C section how\nA series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind this uptick what are the effects on mothers and babies and what did you ... can be done to decrease that number\nAnd that's what we're going to be talking about tea section rapes globally also what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner you get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number\nA poor for seven to for eight to five five you can tweet us ... size fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy is an author author on that lasted series he's also professor of midwife midwifery at the Yale School of nursing\nThank you for joining us today alec enemy\nThanking a tell us the Lancet series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rates can you give us some of the numbers have different regions that must have buried around the world [noise]\nWell it does and um what we found was that over sixty percent of countries over used the sections and twenty five percent under used the normal procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with on\nThe on sort of socio cultural acceptance of surgery as in Norman tests on thing to do part of it has to do is um insurance and um access\nAnd a and a large part of it has to do with um when they're not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first ... so it's it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm In a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean\nFor example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent and um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em too much too soon and too little too late so in the country's than overuse says area and they are probably intervene\nAfrica that don't have enough access probably are under using it about Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... and thought right so when you you think about one in three women in the United states having um has this area and we're way over\nWas talking about over by us there ... for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to ... you know the the interaction but but you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's and accepted norm is part of the culture in in Brazil\nMhm are there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the province [noise] exactly\nAnd again that has to do with access and a wealth education\nUm interestingly enough on women that are have greater education are more likely to have a civilian and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because on hand as his area and it's not a low risk\nUm surgery it is it's a major surgery and and things are\nThere are small but serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and still birth and preterm birth leader and which I'm subsequent pregnancies and that's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states where an increasing maternal mortality rate\nYou mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and\nWhy they're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is sit down and sometimes when a women really needed\nAnd I think it's important to stay at at the outside there are women who and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not\nOne that should be done for the majority of women\nI Want to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and why she sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be vice chair of quality and the department of obstetrics and gynecology yet\nOh let's let's talk about this [noise] but there's also this idea of of planned C sections right to do the do you have to approach this you have ... have you seen has been your experience it's\nQuite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to this he section epidemic in the ... and the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have a delivery biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver I'm In our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions are patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise and sit there and deliver right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing it's\n[noise] yeah uh soon certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who make a recommendation for instance area and I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible\nOn it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics that there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health and fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\nOn the progress during labor in terms of the cervical di ... is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on the brain deliver unit that might put some pressure on to make quicker decision to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision on as obstetricians to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that on patients and families do say yeah um and they ask questions but they generally do say yet\n... only what's your reaction to [noise]\nOh I Would completely agree with her that the culture of the unit where a woman is giving birth is very instrumental um there's a number of strategies we can do\nAnd you have to have the commitment to do the kind of care that's going to help her and her physiology two two best achieving ...\nLet's go to the phones let's go to northern Kentucky Lauren welcome to science friday\n[noise] Hi\nIra thank you for having your own good [noise]\nUm I actually had an emergency C section at thirty one leaf um and I was super cold for that for that [noise] um but when I got pregnant for it back in time\nI really wasn't given the option of it that occurred after section I kind of had to\nDo all of that um that I said I I I look at what they had to look at a rate what were the written for me and my future pregnancies and um it really was up to me it was\nLike my provider\nThat you want to have the time I was like oh sure I haven't read that but I was that get then the risks and benefits of those people to make a truly educated decision um and so I think that um I was able to\nActually plan and it rained heat and then I changed my mind at thirty six and I was really awesome with that and I was able to how to do that but I feel like there was a lot of them are nice and given to me by my provider I really had to search\nOkay in a lot of information what area of motion and it was really hard to find the facts\nAren't learning ... let me get let me get a really great great call let me get a quick reaction Tony look\nYou know I'm truth be told our mysteries should [laughter] but I'm One of three you back in the day everybody had to have one to such an after another and learn was sort of saying you know I didn't know that maybe I did manage to have that\nAccess to be back revenge from birth after to Jerry Anne is going to be is one of the critical interventions that we all as a health care community are going to have to embrace him me to embrace in terms of lowering the overall during delivery rate\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increasing the number of Steve sections and what that means for women's health\nMy guests are Dr highly Kennedy professor of mid were free at the Yale School of nursing director Tony going vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks on on the line and let's see we only uh gosh I Can't get everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how did the approach there compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWell it it it differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out that Debbie World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help\nHelp on us look at decreasing says ... and and one of the things that they have recommended is wet the u._k. does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nTricia too when it's when it's really needed in the Lancet also published a series on that we free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that midwifery was a a so seeded with improved outcomes increased including decreasing C sections\nAnd so one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states that study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of midway free across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um in reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and soon as you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest T section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent of births are attended by mid wise in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent of birds are attended by midwives and then they met that with outcomes and\nIf you look at Alabama Alabama has one of the worst in the tournament infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of bursts are attended by midwives so that's not a causation it is an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um when you have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery news and they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nA tornado and you work to drive down three down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do hear\n[noise] well first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and try to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications for their hands and focus very narrowly on primary sit there and I'm first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor\nThat kind of monitoring called fetal heart rate monitoring is very tricky it's quite an accurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but did not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make surgical ... says and based on such a on such a faulty tests\nTo focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using science and objective criteria rather then subjective words um we focus on our documentation our communication\nWe also really try to make sure that people were using scientific modern definition for progress in labor\nOr old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than new where more modern data really proved to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and I'm enthusiasm for be back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFrom his book you were the best Israel and I would you if you were only from so phone down here in Boston so does this all mean at a fair to the hospital you go to determine is more or less what you'll have a C. section and that\nUnfortunately it does a and so I one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on sit there and delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThey're sitting there and delivery rates may vary by as much as ... percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\nOr we have a tweeter that's relevant to this some services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a typical delivery did did you study that your your your report Holly [noise]\nWell I'm not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money who are wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections who which implies that\nUm they can get you know reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more for this area and to really um level that playing field in in any in addition to liability reform um many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know\nI won't get sued if I Do a C section that I can get sued if I don't do one and\nIssue of reimbursement is is interesting here in the U.S a where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... raised on a very end delivery\nHowever the hospital does and that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients I'm and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here and the U.S Adrian person is greater but it really goes more toward the hospitals side because it's the length of today and let's go to Sharon in Somerville mass harsher\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they were\nMandated by the doctor due to complications from Crohn's disease and so I I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get the perspective of how this is actually playing out\nI'm among laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nDue to my chronic illness complications I had male friends saying things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just ask if you could leader for a little bit and I really interpreted that\nKind of questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't\nYou know pushed the baby out ... and and that was really upsetting to me because\nMy two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me and I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those up the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions\nAnd I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um and different direction slides I'd love to hear the response\nOr I got about a minute Tony are only\nWould I Would I Would completely agree with you that one of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her\nAnd and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is I Would completely agree that it's important that you have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of both ... burst into Syrian or fully fully\nDiscuss I'm Tony what about this the new charges structures of their\nPoint well taken I think you know any extreme is going to be dangerous I think it is important to realize that route\nThat happens on it's no less are no more regardless of what the motives delivery ... delivery on certainly makes you just as much as the mother on as having a veteran whatsoever a\nGreat

honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social um there's never a point in their lived in the life of a hybrid queen or she's living on her own\nBumblebees are different um they have an annually social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerge in the colony and these queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own\nAnd then in the spring IDs queens half to crawl out of there over wintering spot\nAnd started their own asked for their spending most of their life living on their own and so even though there are social insects and they have queens and workers\nAnd that sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary insects are part of their life cycle too and you weren't brought a new show is with with with\nWhat I did yes you'll notice from the get go that it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bumblebees they actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that\nThe ancestor to both of these be groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think of that answer was social but since that time you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way they ... the way that they led\nTo protests Roman uh meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we tend to confuse the two kinds of bees was having equals life\nSwings my lab actually studies ants um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focus and the ants and so\nSome of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forge and how different individuals in the colony contribute to forging reverse the county's hall you brought some apps were too jarring Jarvis harvest grants from I'm here in California I Would much prefer to on the sidewalk since\n... slightly larger than what you really are a little bit longer there but yeah and of course she than the ones you see on the sidewalk\nAnd why why are you interested in\nThese areas and the blacks are the true ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between nest sites\nSo a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they forward and how quickly they called her friends to the food so another thing I brought here at the same cast and asked to flip it over I was on its head also\nWould hang it was like that that's a cast of a an an Smith yes use their like pouring plaster Paris\nIt's exactly faster players from Home Depot how far does that go down and just the whole length I Know that's just the top part\nAbout six or eight inches long it looks from just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can for down other materials we did one cast as zinc um which is the type of metal that when you heat it up like water and so it slows down much deeper and then when it's hard to it's easier to dig around and it won't break like the plaster\nAnd so we can see that it goes much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to so and then my mentor I said he was the these there's a lot of Fox so that determines how deep they can go\nThrough so much focus on queen bumble bee what about the drone and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nNot the drones the drones don't do too much for the call any itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because\nThey have the part of their life or they're living on their own and we've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's an important point to to study\nSomething that the that when I was reading about this and we're going to really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen or something\nWell for the most part we don't know what we do know is that it looks we know what happened during the larval development and they're just like in honeybees and there's a some point during really early larval development where a female larva she can\nStart becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other sort of trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point\nUh but we think that there are probably also factors in order to just like there are in honeybees and bumblebees and people just have to look for them yet\nInteresting lots of questions from the audience what started right or were there on the right side yes go ahead please\nOn my um\nMy mom is allergic to me I was wondering if there is any way that you could extract the DNA from the bees and use it to 'em like helped her heal her when she gets styles\nThat it's a great question I'm allergic to bees to\nBack up first or do you work with ... and you're allergic allergic the honeybee okay but not by movies um that's a really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the terrible reaction on your mum would get if she were sung by being me too\nI'm does a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I that there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the victim and it'd be interesting\nInteresting ... course yeah great question but I'm no longer answer also live in big groups with the queen Howard their lives different from something like a honeybee\nThere's a lot of ... and so there's different types of sociology and um there's some similarities in some differences in first of all many of them live underground where his bees will and\nPut their hives inside fame three cavities\nAnd so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example those honeybees in some species of ants will relocate from one to say to another is so honeybees will\nGo and look for a new nest site and kind of the way the shape of the entrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other ends little off there's a species of frog dance that will look for certain kinds of ...\nThere is some species that have ... counties that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands and even up to ... million so at least cutter ... million individuals\nAnd just been talking for Halloween I noted you also started his social spiders border social spider\nSo upset about more than forty thousand species of spider it's only about forty species are so our social um and what happens is they are living in groups and the reason we think they leave in living the roots has said that they can capture pray that larger than them and so they offered lead build these\nKind of retreat structure is where they live in they raise their offspring together so that you see behind me as they are a bunch of fame spider moms there actually each one is probably the size of a centimeter centimeter half so half an inch or so\nI'm going to begin with a macro lens and the small individuals or their babies that hatched from their ... um and so they take care of all these babies together with their standing on is basically a little nest that they built and then they build another Web that's what we call the capture Web and so that can go basically on and I hold a case of tree\nThere's a science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the typical arts plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\nHow did\nYou sleep last night yeah me neither something about being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard\nBut I Am not the only one I can see from the audience such a strict Shabaab sleep in the United states among other countries are in great fewer than two thirds of us are getting the recommended seven hours per night and you've probably heard by now that it's a bad idea to consistently lose these\nChronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole ...\nWhat is our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits were scheduled\nCould there be jeans at work my next guest says the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep and how will we recover from last week\nAnd he's found one of these genes in a surprising place nowhere near the brain welcome Dr ... Paul associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles\n[noise] then\nYou need to get seven hours of sleep a night that's what the usual requirement is just for um the majority of long term studies\nBetter look tough found that if you get significantly less or significantly more varied and seven to eight point five hours a night van that doesn't work out well for human\nChime in a lot of trouble now because I get like sick if I'm lucky I get seven I Know\nHow can I add in all honesty I'm going to fix our crowd myself why do we need to sleep in the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why as one of the reasons I have a job actually what we do know is that if you don't sleep adequately bad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences\nIf you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first star what we consider the short term\nSo many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here and may go hang out to a party or you just maybe for the kids not getting enough sleep tomorrow\nYour memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things you may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do those tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects if you continue daily on a regular basis\nNot getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at higher risk for infectious diseases and it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease stroke and diabetes\nI mentioned about genetics and sleep what what they're about genes are they involved in sleeping\nAnd interestingly enough I think God genes are pretty much involved in everything we do uh what what\nDoes it what about sleep what our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours that quality what what one of the genes\nDoing that's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about James is you're not just talking about\nHow genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment so I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of\nGenes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works I'm from a kind of line of research that has shown that genes play an important role and timing sleep\nOn the time of day you prefer to sleep time of day you prefer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day or sleep most of the night on what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restored if properties of sleep\nThe things about sleep that preserves your memory and your ability to focus\nAnd the things about sleep that improve your health the genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown\nAnd that's what my research is focused on\nNow what fascinated me about reading about you\nAre not in our brains they're not in our heads\nThey're well they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressing the brand they're expressed in the body the gene that I focused on in my most recent study below one has expressed in the majority of tissues in which\nWe have ... so the ... one is what's known as the clot chain\nOf clocks in every cell in your body very real clocks in order for something to be characterized as the clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it it has to be an ... and the timing mechanism like gears I talked to my students about gives on the ... most of them don't know the clock is er [laughter]\nSo I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones\nThat keep time it is an output mechanism that allows you to tell the time the majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulates sleep\nOn for a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we look primarily in their brain because the block that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain and most of the things that drivers sleep around the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks and the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas and the brain and tell your brain how to sleep and more importantly\nHow to recover from sleep loss and when do you mean how to recover so the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes to low or turn the heat on your thermostat sort of the heat on if it goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep processing works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day if you don't get enough sleep their body will try to compensate by having you sleep more if you get too much sleep it will go and the other direction the clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature\nIn the evening it says to go to another it works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved in the ... mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes\nThat are like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing also play a role in your ability to recover from those so when you say the clock\nIs that the the circadian rhythm we've\nTalking about the circadian clock that regulates your daily rhythms\nMorning goes down it might um synchronize are clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness I'm a constant light than clock would still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism and it would isolate other period or frequency close to twenty four hours\nQuestion over here you know I have a question about napping as I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an app [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you're speaking of themselves\nSo napping is a is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way they do in ... years now and that all I Do know one of the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap in my office in the afternoon no one can complain if you're going right at all I mean I Know what I was researching\nWhat you're saying nothing is important is mapping is very important\nIf you're not getting daily suspiciously and most of us to have children or have jobs or live in a busy environment may not be getting um sufficient sleep so if you're not than getting an afternoon nap an hour's usually was about recommended but anything from a half hour to an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much too much that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine if the ideal time for napping is driven by clock mechanism\nUm especially those of us get sleepy or the afternoons\nSometimes between one to three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now\nOh gosh so I have to be pretty animated when I'm teaching but you can't blame them either directly right that's why I don't try to understand but that's just me back to work harder to where it let me go to the questions on their side yes\nHi my question is about the adolescent brain and sleep out ever since I was in high school we were talking about shifting the start time for high schoolers to be later in the day\nBecause yes [laughter]\nAnd and as a parent and I definitely want that to happen because getting my kids up in the morning before now is a challenge how does your study affect our decision making and farming our society in that arena\nSo the quickest way to answer your question is that my study doesn't affect that\nAdolescents sleeping and timing the fact that adolescents under a adolescent masturbation is associated with the land circadian rhythms as well known since I first came into this profession what would you bring up as a great point about the ability of scientists to affect public policy",
