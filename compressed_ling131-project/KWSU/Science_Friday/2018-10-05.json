Gregory Winter and what what did they win for [noise]\nUm so they both work on a this technique called ... display which ... harness the bacteria phages there are viruses that infect bacteria\nUm and it's kind of a similar principle where you're taking advantage of people living systems to produce useful molecules proteins and antibodies um that have all kinds of biological and medical applications ... what about physics [noise]\nSo in physics the prize was awarded ... three researchers to work with lasers a pretty cool [laughter] um are they're asking ... Strickland 'em and they basically not just use lasers but use lasers ... tool so asking um developed this technique called optical tweezers where he basically\nFigured out that when you point a laser focused beam of light out\nOf fear ... object the object is actually drawn towards the center of the beam and you can use that to manipulate\nThings just ... particles or as big of a bacterial cells are seen the tractor for him [laughter] yeah [laughter] it's a real life tractor beam and fortunately doesn't work on that large of a laid there pretty focus [laughter] but um it's fun to think about\n... after winning ... explain what amazed her most about the research\n... one of these remarkable things one colored water clear and come ... short and remarkable where all the color\nShades of Isaac Newton\nYeah yeah ... hearing that Strickland actually mentioned that she um you could ... ... light generation when she teaches introductory physics courses so that's something that anyone can appreciate don't need to be a Nobel laureate ... the the really cool phenomenon\n... move onto physiology ... medicine [noise]\nSo the award for medicine when kids two researchers Jane Palestine and took ... for their work on um you know therapy um this is basically a treatment that uses the body's own immune system to fight against cancer\nAnd both researchers discovered protein that after this break on the immune system um so when those proteins are engaged ... that they normally are they prevent immune system from attacking\n[noise]\nI'm I replied oh you're listening ... science friday we're talking with doctor Francis Arnold the recipient of the twenty teens ... Nobel Prize ... chemistry um\nHey ... lot of people think you're a scientist but you were very proud of engineer are you not\nI Am ... what the differences ... well I Love to build things I'd like to make new things that didn't exist before of course chemist do that as well they build new molecule was\nSo we're we're blending together chemistry and engineering in evolution of new protein\nSit down at a keyboard and type out a recipe for some form of new genetic smell it out and and what a new gene comes back to you [laughter]\nYou know it's it's really amazing it's changed so much in Thirty years that I've been doing this\nSo that today you really can't type out a DNA sequence now whether it's a recipe is a different story and we can talk about that but you can type out a DNA sequence email it off to your favorite supplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\nYou saying that talk that I I Want to write new DNA what does that mean to you [noise] actually\nIt's easy to write new DNA what's hard is composing it think about a DNA is the code of life it's the product of almost four billion years of evolution\nWe don't know how to compose new DNA we can ride it we can read it we can edited but we don't know how to compose it how do you compose something codes of a complex biological function that didn't exist before [noise]\nSo if you ... what is the problem in the composition why can't you compose [noise]\nBecause we don't understand how DNA encodes function remember biology molecular biology is a brand new discipline it's been around the the structure of DNA was published in Nineteen fifty three\nSo it's not been understood for but for a very short time\nAnd how DNA goes through all the complicated things of itself and makes biological molecules and codes the the the the structure and function to these biological molecules\nIs the brand new field and we still don't understand those rules\nSo what you mean then and what what do people mean and then when you say are the directed evolution of something what does that process me [noise]\nYou know it's just like breathing it we've been breeding cats dogs racehorses lab rats corn for thousands of years without really manipulating DNA directly but now that we can synthesize DNA and put it in a test tube\nI can go direct the DNA and\nCombined DNA from different sources different species I can dial in levels of random mutations that can do\nDecide who goes on to parent the next generation\nAnd then how do you get a useful product that I'm that what's the next step [noise]\nSo you put the DNA into a microbe and they start reading it as if it were their own\nAnd a day and they then take the DNA and create the proteins that the DNA in code\nThan I as the breeder of molecules so to speak I have to decide who is better than what I started with which one of those microbes make the better protein and that's called good old fashioned analytical chemistry\nSo are you take the DNA out of that and feed it back and I do it all over again\nIs it's sort of creating life in that cell of a new you're creating a new form of life or you're not [noise]\nWell I I think that probably exaggerating because life was there for me to work with were using the tools to biology to make new things I'm making new proteins they're not alive but they do do some things inside of cells\nBut you do you need to sell to help you make the protein [noise]\nWell actually so [noise] you don't have to have this self there's now very powerful systems where you can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test tube with no cells at all\n[noise] and so uh where do you rent to really see this research why what is what is your ultimate goal here [noise]\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human beings to use the power\nOf biology the power of biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make therapeutic agents and and and pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives from renewable resources without producing excess weight just\n... I saw on your talk is that I have fun for spring molecules to have sex with Oh yes I Do [laughter]\nWell if you think about sex you have to wonder why nature would devise such a strange process and have all these half the population that doesn't carry the next generation\nSo there has to be some benefit to re combining your DNA with somebody else and that benefit is the innovation comes around if you we combined DNA you get progeny\nPeople get a phone call or two before we have to go let's go to Adrian and Hamdan I imagine [noise]\nHi this is a non and hand that um [noise] I grew up in Southeast Asia where\nMy parents my cousin's everyone around me were just starting out their math or engineering\nMy son who is about two and a half years old\nWhat I'm trying to figure out how to identify his mind said whether it's the towards chemistry or um math so may not be completely irrelevant question but I Would love to hear your thoughts on the subject how to identify your kids\nOr younger generations um your skill sets that they can go towards chemistry or science or physics\n[noise] did you know did you know what an early age Dr Arnold that you want to I I\nI was lucky my fires the nuclear physicist and he always thought the girls could do math just as well as boys could so he never discourage me and I also had four brothers to compete with\nAnd I like being the winner [laughter] so I had a father who encouraged my natural tendency never discouraged it and had plenty of people to compete with\nWell you know I hear this from so many scientists we've talked to over the years that they had a role model and mentor somebody could even be their parents who kept them are good kept alive or encourage their interest in science same thing for you it seems\nIt seems so and I miss my father he passed away two years ago but he would have loved this news\n... or ... and he's the right to add to to answer the listener's call is there any way to identify any young age who's talented in science\nI think all children are talented and if they love it they will ask questions they will do it I think the most important thing is not to discourage someone\n... have a tweet from Sydney who says please ask what she knows about how we instinct isn't coated in DNA example dogs urge to bury things\nI Wish I knew but it's clear that many important behaviors are at least partially genetically encoded loyalty in dogs there's so many interesting behaviors or they can be bred but we don't really understand what the genetic details that are\nAs we sequenced more things and under and measure their properties will be using in Portland in powerful tools like machine learning to peace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow in a time of contentious dues indivisible political races Ken we have better conversations\nAbout the issues they get is most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic\nLogic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those devices or at least understand why we're disagreeing so passionately our guest is Dr Eugene Chang mathematician a scientist in residence at the school of the art Institute of Chicago\nHer newest book is the art of logic in India logical world and uh [noise]\nWe want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something\nSome some listeners of funding in and first one Alex is from Chicago hey I'll let my neighbor\n[noise] hey hey there you go ahead so odd\nDining previously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist um and I had done so because my logic with that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who\nUm had said you know out as a black male\nYou know you might be doing things that contribute to I'm white supremacist system that you might just so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way\nUm women or being a man who contributes to suicide you stick systems unknowingly wasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to identify as feminists um it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminine system so\nI mean that's um and identify myself in such a way really changed my mind um and I thought about that that's great thanks for calling that is correct that very heartening\nIs you know as part of the problem that we don't see how we are there see us\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is that we often spent you know I'm trying to defend our own points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed that he is\nAnd one thing I found very interesting in that the cool has experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences\nSo in a way I think the logic with you very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else's analogous experience\nI have a tweet from James who says to me logical discussions do require math it requires empathy empathy is caring enough to respect another view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\n[noise] I agree I think the logic does not require math but logic is in a way pauses math\nAnd these things have poorest boundaries I mean we've constructed a lot of us official boundaries between subjects that bureaucratic purposes\nBut I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me\nWith logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician in order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician or not\nWe'll talk about some some of the current events or let's turn out to the oddest topic in current events and that is voters in Congress are divided over whether to believe accusations of sexual assault ticket and it's a judge Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd whether that should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write that in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical process as at play tell me what you mean by that\n[noise] well that's a whole other our whole lot of different parts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because a lot of people claim to the principle of the presumption of innocence\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison for saying certain things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence there is a paradox because some people say well we have to bring you pick someone innocence until that until that proved guilty\nBut thing is that if you have an accuser undone accused personnel let's just say the accuser is a woman and the accused person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation\nAnd so then we have a ... because we can't actually hold them on on the woman both innocence at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nAnd mathematics and fill us if you have studied paradoxes for a long time I studied ways to resolve paradoxes by shifting levels are finding that things that are to a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of\nPresuming the accused person to be innocent and then we can look whoa whoa that creates for us and what mathematics does all the time and it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical will run out and then we look at not world and go what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accuse people to the innocence until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen and does happen I'm happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives\nSo do we kept that so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so having a false accusation\nUm would be when somebody is innocent but is thought is accused of being guilty and the other way is when someone who's guilty but didn't prove to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about what are your prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe different situations that have a different now ... hypothesis situation [noise]\nThey were forced into four to five five lots of

organisms interact [noise] gladly\nUm well when the dung beetle is ready to reproduce they a tunnel underneath a done Patty and they create these developmental chambers out and done that we call it breed ball and in each of those ... balls they place a single egg\nAnd from being an egg to an adult beat all of that that developing beat all depends on his developmental chamber for its nutrients that for a shelter and protection\nAnd uh none of toads right along on these beetles there there's\n... and um we didn't know before whether that was a good thing or a bad thing um but we did know that um that this association existed and so this is something that we wanted to investigate more to understand the consequences of that interaction so\nTell me tell me what did you learn\nWell um we looked at all in all different parts of the um ... and we found them on various part but we're particularly interested in is really high concentration of nematodes it's found on the genitalia um it's a good place for a number towards to hide but also it's a really compelling a\nVenue for getting to the next generation because it's involved and reproduction\nAnd so what we found was not only are are these ... passed between males and females but they're also passed off to the offspring and the offspring that develop alongside these nematodes actually a grow faster and larger than their counterparts to 'em that don't have these ...\nAnd so there's actually a fitness benefit to having this um [noise]\nI wouldn't even call it a parasite because under any conditions that we tested we didn't find that that the number two it was actually bad for the developing fetal I'm In the the conditions under which we tested in those we always found that it was a good thing to have it along so it's more of a mutual is really\nYou know I was wondering about but usually a parasite is pumping fluctuate a life of what is host right but this was not what's happening here [noise]\nNo and that was um nematodes are are almost infamous for being parasites they're parasites of humans have cattle plant\n'em and a lot of our attention is directed towards that sort of negative interaction um but less investigated his ways in which they can be either neutral or even beneficial to their hopes\nThat science friday I'm Ira Flatow and the past few years the field of exoplanet discovery has really taken off instruments like Kepler and the newer tests have been racking up the planet count but this week astronomers writing in the journal science advances\nBrought to hoping to a new level describing the possible discovery not have an exoplanet\nBut at the moon orbiting an exoplanet to be specific\nKepler sixteen dash twenty five dash be and is some four thousand light years away has to do that well joining me now to talk about the research is Alex peachy Eason NSF graduate research fellow\nAnd the department of astronomy right here in New York at Columbia University welcome to science friday thank you very much for having me first what what moon is just we're ready to give us a little\nThumbnail description sure yes so it's a a moon as far as we can tell if we're not quite claiming it as a discovery yet there's still some lingering uncertainties but as far as we can tell it's there\nAre a large moon about the size of Neptune actually which is sort of strange um orbiting this plant called Kepler sixteen twenty five be and it's about eight thousand light years away as far as we can do\nSo but so what is the relationship with the size of the moon to the size of the points\nSo the size of the planet is\nOne is ah like you said about the size and the mass of net but even at a pretty unusual well known that big a well it's certainly unexpected right when if you look at the moon's in our solar system uh we've got a lot of them are they're all ... significantly smaller than the earth so\nUh when we spotted this we said to you know this is what it looks like about the size of Neptune\nThat as sort of a raises new questions for people how how do you get something that big it's a little premature to say how common are how rare something like this might be because this was potentially the first so we don't have any sort of population statistics on these things\nUh but uh you know you could argue that because it is the largest you know because it is so large a it's sort of the lowest hanging fruit so maybe it's not entirely surprising that the first one we see is so large\nYou know because we think of our moon we think of another body hitting earth and knocking out a piece of writing that looked like that and this case\nUh yeah it's right there so there's basically three mechanisms that we think we get the moon's from an impact or scenario like how we got earth's moon a moon coalescing out of a disk of material swirling around the planet in the early days of the planetary system like the way we get the moons of Jupiter and Saturn Uranus\nAnd then finally a capture scenario like a Neptune largest moon Tritan as far as we can tell that was captured from the ... belt\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads a little\nBit yeah and we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you how do you detect a moon I Know that theory but that detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nYes how are you know there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful way so far\nIs using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness of the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the star like\nIf there's a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks out some of the light as well\nIn addition to that uh we try to see the gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of course is pulling on the moon but the moon is pulling on the planet and so that makes the planet wobble around a bit as it is it orbits the store and so\nSometimes that planetary transit comes in early other time it comes in late and so those are really the to light\nSo uh something ... folks are pulling on the planet that uh that uh we're attributing\nTo them and they insist on that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right when did they say out loud\nSo it's an extraordinary claim and is the famous thing goes extraordinary claim is a one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job or trying to\nRule out other possible explanations for this signal\nA question naturally comes out is there something weird going on with the telescope is this maybe something happening on the surface of the star could there be another planet in the system and that's that's pulling on this planet and making it walk around\nA those are all plausible explanations a but we've done our best to rule out those alternative explanations and uh as far as we can tell you know the numbers are saying the moon's there but because it is such a an incredible claim\nOr it may be incredible it's not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system are needed to really confirm it\nWell it was so unusual I Am I reading from my notes you that you were able to get viewing time on the Hubble for this very hard to get so you must have been other people might want to know about\nThis measure yeah yeah you know so we had a a observed three transits of the planet and the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits in with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event ah we observe the system for about forty hours altogether\nSo if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope uh from the surface of the earth so you'd have to stitched together multiple datasets for multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh obviously we made a a convincing enough case that are that they gave us the time\nThey're they're talking about the wants to ... is gone and I'm I'm I don't know why it could be but that's not for me [laughter] um [noise] it can be used up uh the Webb telescope is that right ... a better for you guys were looking at some point it's going to be like why yeah if it had been spectacular\nInstrument it's a very very large mirror uh\nHubble staring at this target but then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single orbit Hubble takes Ninety six minutes or so to go round so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out a James don't jaded just he won't have that problem and like I said the mere is going to be really spectacular so\nUh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long or that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly afford the time so we're going to have to have a very good case [noise]\nYou know their exams that arms to another edition\nOf obsolete is the wrong word but they're all everything is always an obsolete by the time he gets built a highway or something else that makes some law well I Wish it made it twice as big what you're saying whatever I Am sure yeah you\nKnow so there's other telescopes coming down the pike that there are people bidding right now to well if we've talked about a W first and then there's a\nA telescope called ... more than a new one ... yeah that's\nA I I don't know who's working on it that it's it's a ultraviolet and I read an optical that's L. O. U. V. I. O. R. and I said so uh that they come up with great names for these things are so there's going to be some fantastic instrument stadium is team will definitely be an improvement on Hubble\nBut you know Hubble was over twenty five years old now and it still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it truly amazing\nIt is All right so if this is a strange jar planet situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planet situation\nThat's a great question and one of the things that I I'm always saying to people is you know they always come into question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd ah you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems we are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much still open how common are we would is is the things going on here\nHappened in a billion hundred billion mother places across the Milky Way or it's this very uncommon chain of events that that led to us here and that of course speaks directly to\nAh the question about the origin of life for example ah so it's particularly since this a moon is raising new questions about how you get something like this it's opening up the new questions about the dynamic all histories of these uh a planetary systems and and the speaks directly to that\nOnce you're going to open rather get answers five\nWell that that's a good enough number and does that ... we are now really filling in some nice statistics but there have been surprises along the way we found these things called hot Jupiter is you know plan it's about the size of Jupiter but very very close to the store nobody\nReally expected to see these things at all and even twenty some years after their first discovery or the theaters are still debating how you how you make these things\nI saw a story today just in passing I don't have any details about a new exoplanets too big you shouldn't be as big as certainly right sure it in a\nOr under events [noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking with author Deborah Blum about how food safety protections came to be a topic of her new book proportions squad one cameras single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century our number eight four four Seventy four\nEight to five five I'm let's turn up the the clock back to that time period ... or you have an entire chapter on catcher\n[laughter] what was so and after that ... while you're devoted why rent and I know why or why devote the tell our listeners an entire chapter I catch up [noise]\nSo this is a catch up it's just an amazing story at this point for a couple of reasons one is we have this very twenty first idea scrawny first century idea of catch up which is you know kind of a sick tomato based kind of a but\nIn the nineteenth again at tended to be a kind of fan nasty\nA sauce with a lot of vegetable ways to end that people would put pumpkin ... people would\nPut tomatoes but they might be riding they would die them sometimes what's called our guys and then because of the whole mess of it tended to kind of be rotten anyway they dumped preservatives and like sodium ...\nWhich is actually still with us today and so this ... because of this kind of battle ground or food safety just as meat did was Upton Sinclair\nAnd in this case I really love the story because it makes a point that you know not every business is evil and a Henry J kind of a law Heinz\nFood manufacturing company took it upon himself to get preservatives out of his ... his products see reinvented catch up so the catch up we know today was really created by Heinz\nAnd he did it so there was a lot of tomato an asset that kept a bacterial count down and then he really went to war a mean this was a battle between business and advocates and and got business friendly government\nAnd Heinz although he was a big believer and profit really pushed for safer products and actually sent his or some of the people who work with them to meet with Roosevelt and say you have got to regulate food safety\nPreservatives I Want you to do something and catch up kinda catches all of that plus you know there was a major combat over the preservatives and catch her and that was pretty fascinating\nI was talking about a ... Harvey Washington where I was a little bit more than the focus of your book in the courtroom squad um [noise]\nHe actually started where people volunteering to eat stuff for him to test out yes fruits have you ever tell us about that because what's the point of why did you have to Khamenei [noise]\nIt's just crazy you I mean when you read this experiment first thing you think if you could never do this today right you would never get it passed all of our control\nBut what happened was he had been working really sense for about Twenty years trying to get food safety trying to get labels you know at completely not able to move forward politically\nAnd he finally said okay well let's just have some better evidence and I'm going to skip those you know a less important other species I'm not going to do any animals safety testing at all I'm just going to dump these things into human beings\nAnd that's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment\nIn which he persuaded young government employees are mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerously and the deal was\nThey would eat three free meals a day seven days a week and it would be beautifully cooked by a professional chef and all kinds of wonderful ingredients but half of this group at any given time had to be adding capsules\nOf the compound that he was testing at various doses from very low to very hot\nAnd so during the poison ... squad experiments he looked at formaldehyde unfettered he looked at ... which is a cleaning product and looked at ... which is a fever reduce or a you know a medicine\nAnd he kept ... rotating these through these tests and what he said was he hadn't expected the young men to get as sick as they did but they almost immediately started having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems\nAnd because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers [noise]\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad since the front page news all across the country you're food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public out\nSo what did he have some experience in his own life that motivated hams wanted you know create this poison the water gets to the bottom of the food safety [noise] you know\nThat's a great question I think he was kind of a holy\nRoller cameras right he his dad had been a preacher a farmer but also in like ten or a preacher\nOn the conductor on the underground railroad during the civil war\nAnd he had imbued his kids are with this kind of sense of higher calling and and why only really I mean what was interesting about him was that he took on this issue of food safety which the USDA had never really been interested in\nFrom the very beginning and then he just starts feeling at a party is feeling the layers of it apart\nAnd the more he realizes how at risk people are\nThe more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying we'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people but what about children what about the elderly what about the sick and so he has the sense that\nUh the role of the government [noise]\nHang on ...\n[laughter] they can take a drink of water [laughter] there you go um [noise] he\nHas this very early sense of the role of the government when we say in the constitution promote the general welfare this is kinda how I said\nHe really means promote the general welfare and your everyday life that part of what we do is we stand up for the citizens that I think he became perceived as an advocate as much as a scientist and that's probably right\nBut he wanted to use this position to make a difference and he actually dead that's the thing that one of the things I Love about\nThis story it's a story of a single person who drives a conversation right for thirty something years but changes the conversation on our way we think about food safety\nSo did he actually we're in we're in our laws created because of his crusade where the Congress actually put teeth and the FDA and things like that can be angry\nI Am so after you know he's like battling away stymied by eventually in Nineteen oh six to laws passed then one was the meat inspection act and that was the director\nAbout a week later the food and drug active Nineteen oh six past\nSomewhat carried by that kind of tidal wave of fury that brought us the meat inspection act\nAnd that was an and I we've forgotten this but that was the first great consumer protection low\nEver passed by the federal government and so it was the moment in which we all agree as a society that the government's job is in part to protect the average citizen from harm\nAnd to stand up in that way if you asked why he would say okay that was a star but the law was immediately weekend by business interactions\nWhich it was to the point that he he ended up extremely frustrated I don't think he ever fully gave himself credit for what he accomplished\nBut and eventually that law led to a law in the Nineteen thirties that created the modern FDA so a lot of people still call him the father of the FDA even though he died before it was created\nOr you know you said though that you disagree with some of his of his tactics [noise]\nYou know he was as I say kind of a holy roller and he became very rigid I I think some of that was that he was under attack constant attack both in government and out of it for Thirty years and he kind of awesome five to some extent in a perpetual defensive position\nBut also he he just\nHe couldn't bend on even the little details so he would like spend his political capital this is my personal\nOpinion I'm sure it appreciate it [laughter] as a second guess their mug for years later [laughter] you would like obsessed about you've made of vinegar and it's a fake vinegar and you should not be allowed to even put\nThe image of a grape belief on your label but can somehow that might make someone think that you weren't really grapes and so he would spend a lot of capital on these very tiny details", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "05"}
