the hour an update on where world nations than Don curbing carbon emissions and avoiding it climate catastrophe but first\nThursday morning two astronauts on route to the international space station had to abort their launch after a booster rocket malfunctioned made an emergency dissent back to earth and are happy to report both are\nDoing well both landing safely Rachel Feldman science editor of popular science issue to bring us up to date on the launch and other select Detroit subjects in Science Welcome back right Joe\nThanks for having me Ira anything more about what went wrong there\nYet so we know that about two minutes into the launch there was some kind of booster failure and they had to undergo what's known as a a ballistic Landay ballistic descent which is so called because\nUsually they add make kind of out of a shallow angle as they come down to create a little bit of laughed and take away some of the um\nThe the force on on the astronaut string landing and this is where the rock literally coming down more like a projectile and this has happened before but only ever um during landings which of course appears a lot less dramatic because uh they were supposed to come back down to the ground and the first place\nSo this is the first time they've ever had to make a such an aborted landing during a launch and um the Russian space agencies that immediately they would begin investigating to us so far that that's all we know\nOne of the good news about it is that it worked right [laughter] right [laughter] right and again this is a rare but the kind of\nThings that astronauts train for all the time it's not something that happens a lot but certainly one of the procedures that they are expected to uh occasionally encounter so you know not something we want to have happened but something that is certainly on the roster of things they have learned how to handle\nWell but but but with the Soyuz capsule being the only way for humans to reach the international space station isn't this now\nSo you missions planned that are now kind of up in the air because the Russian space agency again is undertaking this investigation and so it's possible some of those will be put on hold and even if they're not uh you know those two crew members who were counted on who are now on the ground instead of on that\nI mean that there's there's probably going to be a gap in staffing you know we have three people on the space station right now but they're scheduled to come back in December and now they could extend their day a bit but still your capital they have\nUp there that's going to bring them home I Believe it's only a it can only stay up there through some time in January so\nUh that's the longest there'll be able to stay before coming back down and that means that the speciation probably will be an crude for some amount of time which is something that we know should be possible there are procedures in place for it but I don't believe it's ever happened before\nYou go to check on whether there are experiments up there to [noise]\n\n[noise] this is science friday I'm Ira played out there is less than a month until the mid term elections on November sex and there's a lot of talk about hacking and voters security the federal government has said hackers\nTargeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election but reportedly no information was changed or manipulated yet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference\nWell it showed how hackers could break into voting machines\nSo what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure happen we security systems\nHow does all of this affect voting behavior and our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security heading into the mid term elections we want to hear from you give us a call our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five\nEight ... for ... you can also tweet us ... what concerns you most about voting security heading into these terms\nLet me bring on my guests Lawrence Norden is a deputy director of the Brennan Center Democracy Program at New York University Welcome to science friday\nThanks Ira You're welcome Charles Stuart the third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\n... here and it's nice to have you um Larry I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do their\n[noise] I'm not sure that we know and Charlie what they were trying to do first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um there's a lot of conversation about Russian interference in the election in two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one of these attacks on the election and priests\nSocial media propaganda and attack on campaigns and their emails those are those are two separate things uh if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nA we saw them targeting a voter registration databases again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases are the rules that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which uh manufacturers e pull books was attacked but I think\nUm we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWas that was that the vendor company that was putting P. C. anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off [noise] is that what you're talking about in that case there was something different you know\nKnow what I'm Talking about is um uh there there is a company the our systems might actually I think they may still [laughter] they may still are not have confirmed whether or not there are there certainly was an attempt to hack then\nI'm ... and again they manufacture a poll books and and I deal with registration databases\nOr electronic pull books or what you can kind of what argues they're often or a tablet or art or or computers that are used to check people in\n'em and uh uh as I said I last I checked I think they have they they may have denied that they were actually successfully breach but at least in one of the Muller indictments there was an indication that there was\nSome there and it sounded like them that that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromised [noise] well um [noise]\nUm well that's actually quite a controversial question I mean you ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped um I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um\nPerhaps to influence the elections ranging from um affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um\nIf we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines and systems um in the first\nTalking a bit about 'em you alluded to at the Twenty one states\nUm they got attacked those are voter registration systems um and then there are the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several states um\nPotentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan paper ballots and if we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to\nThe DEF CON um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to\nI'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known that um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine and do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um\nRequire such a degree of direct access that in order to have I'm actually in effective attack on them um you would need some sort of inside job\nUm that would require a lot of attention to particular machines and we'll be easily detected and so um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing 'cause it's easier to actually affect\nThis type of kind of brute force attack against the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials do\nDuring the day right\nUm well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking um [noise] um are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that\nUm the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't have any sort of paper record of the election when they're in a busy\nWe're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic an accuracy testing we are doing that um there were mistakes made\nBy a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could I think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify\nThat the machines weren't monkey with and there were mistakes and the programming so um so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of thinking that the machines right now for twenty Eighteen are well taken care of\nAnd are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks that we see at DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the states to move in directions\nTo make it easier to demonstrate the skeptics that that was\nI I could just jump in real ... point um I I I\nI I think there to build on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but um [noise] more importantly there's there there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and it's an example of that my an obvious example was election night reporting which comes out\nUm and that's how we get the unofficial results although we don't call them that on election night very quickly\nUm that comes up on on websites and gets report it out and uh we we have seen in fact not in the United states or that I Know of but in other countries ... election reporting attacks\nUm and um if if you get ... incorrect numbers there in in the environment that we have today the hyper partisan environment where there is\nUm a lot of false information put out on social media ... I was talking earlier about that level of interference from the Russians and the two thousand sixteen election casting doubt on election outcomes if you don't have as a as we don't in in in that it's Thirteen states at least in in some polling places and Thirteen states\nPaperback up that you can go back to afterwards and say\nYeah maybe there's been doubt cast on these elections but we can go back and we have something that's independent of the software to tell us the results\nUm I I think that's that's very dangerous and I am hopeful that into Thirteen states where we still have these um paperless systems or that will be replacing them before the twenty twenty election yeah you know 'cause why ... last few weeks ago\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow back in December of twenty Fifteen\nHundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change and signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts such as rising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages and and more powerful storms and\nTo limit the temperature increase to just one point five degrees Celsius but how much does half a degree a bus from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the inter governmental panel on climate change the eyepiece he see this week cash shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years\nIs Dr Kelly da Vinci is senior associated with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday [noise] thank\nYou so much to be with you want to turn out a shout out to our listeners began with this question as we barrel tour they one of the half degree increase in global temperature are you worried are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give ... give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to for eight to five five eight four forced into four to five five\nYou can also tweet us at ... fry 'em [noise] so Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to a degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells us\nBut even at one point five degree increase is gonna bring some pretty big changes\n[noise] yeah that's absolutely right so that has agreement actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue efforts for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and now is because for some of the most vulnerable countries can think of that small island developing states on one point five degrees out there is also going to harm wellbeing to a tremendous extent [noise]\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming as one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius\nAnd they found that indeed we are definitely not on track on and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference and getting for example [noise]\nJust for example on what they found is they look to class and number of different systems and they found I for example for extreme heat the percentage of the global population exposed to as severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with\nWith two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about on the ice free Arctic in the summer on when you don't have any ice on on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can ... impact climate change even further because you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and wild that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted\nA species losses um two times worse for both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for ... attacks\nOn us almost forty percent worse or under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic\nI said these are some really big numbers one of the most devastating and surprising wants to me which for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of the further decline in coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent which is just tremendous\nDoesn't look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay on to point zero degree [noise]\nSo what the report finds is that both on two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible on there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make that transition happen\nOn right now on emissions are roughly fifty to get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nThey're projected to increase even with the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide per year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century\nSo this is a tremendous transformation and the combination rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about on it also would require behavioral and technological shift across the board so\nFive percent of electricity I to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand increasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices on a lot of different measures out of which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but not as we need\nYou know the president said he wanted to know quote to dream to report it won't go there with that can you can you answer at least two commission do what they do they use [noise]\nSure so on and the way that the IPC she worked on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision\nOn requested the ... the the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists and had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that on\nThe scientist basically attached to all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius and see what the science says I'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case on there's an accompanying summary for policy makers which was agreed upon in Korea\nUm about a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators con make sure that they feel comfortable with the um the implications for policy makers do in this case I'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually endorsed this report\n[noise] [noise] ... a lot of people want to talk about what I'm going to go to the phones to Janice in South Carolina Janice [noise]\nHello so culture and I think what ends up confusing people when you talk about one and a half degrees people aren't real excited about it what really hurts us and I will culture\nIn the high temperatures that record highs so for example in the mid west it's corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced to jail or in the Central Valley of California wouldn't tomatoes when the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen\nAnd so this was really critical of are the highs not just the average temperatures and fixes back right away more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nSo much the ... atmosphere it's cool the planet at all so much we had a little ice age and I wish more the scientist would talk about that because we can we can substitute a lot of our renewables because he filed you'll vital death other things like that that will make us grow more\nPlants and we can have them for food feed and feel I oh you are you a farmer [noise]\nNo I'm a researcher actually but I have a small farm and on the developer energy chipper which makes sense for food feeding fuel all the same makers and the use as little water and nitrogen you know and everybody thinks we're going to have some you know put Seattle to atmosphere what all the plants will take it up if we switch to renewable using plants\nBurn it let me get a comment thanks thanks for your call what about can we saw some of the CEO to reverse some of the\nThings on it to some really good points here\nI think first on as um as you mentioned the one point five degree goal is for global average temperature increased temperatures increase at any one location especially on any one particular moment in time as well as the impacts are going to vary and that and that's an incredibly important point\n[noise]\nHumans beat stress with exercise in prescriptions squirrel monkey about very strange way of their own um Ira Plato and this is science friday

to that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they moved quite fast they're pretty active\nSo it's not that easy to individually identify them particularly the juveniles because they they kind of looks very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality uh yeah they do stand out\nOkay give me a typical day in the life of a squirrel monkey [noise]\nSo square monkey to wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping tree\nAnd so they spend a lot of time forging in the morning for insects but really that goes on all day when it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to rest but rest for a group of ... monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to just sleeping tree until about seven\nOr they're productive or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper [noise]\nYes so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshopper sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nAnd would head up and then they bite off the head kind of like an ice cream cone and then they slurp the inside and then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes and they seem very happy while they're doing it\nWow [laughter]\nAnd I understand they're not afraid to attack a while I'll watch Smith [noise] wait why or why haven't they do that\nYeah so I've only seen adults do it but I actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a wasp snatch a particular species\nAnd um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are not that Hank pretty low\nAnd once the adult lost desert the nest the adults a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that room left abandoned in the nest\nWow for their pretty braids been pretty bad and patient and patient [laughter] it was once we're not leaving cellphone right yeah I've done this by so we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here lots of ... of of the other one of the spider monkey what's what's your that clip\n[noise]\nScar monkeys or spider monkey everybody does that or is that right yeah okay tell us what we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but\nUm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize their own\nUm I can recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver so um but when there is you know ten of them in a tree it's kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\nWe have another clip that sounds a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm [noise]\n\n[noise] okay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there was an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there it's a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies of jungles or you know that that ... that we hear is that right there there's usually this is those a squirrel monkey so we're listening to\nIt might it might be birds actually because squirm won't you sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest um that's what my students usually notice is that isn't that a bird and if you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group a squirrel monkey [noise] instead of ... and how hard\nWas it how much time has it taken you to know the difference in the study that found fame it [noise]\nSo it's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys\nUm you just get used to it um it it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant he's\nThe monkey was for her and she knows everything about square monkey then so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkey\nHow long have you been doing that for a little longer\nHe started with with uh a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing for about Twenty years the monkey risk for yeah\nDo you call him ... yes sometimes did they like it she loves it [laughter] is there anything that we can\n[noise] yeah so um it's interesting that you bring that up because um [noise] so there's a a hypothesis that was proposed about Twenty years ago called the vocal grooming hypothesis\nAnd um the idea here is that you can try to understand the evolution of human language so the idea that humans started living in social groups that we're increasingly large and so ... Manuel grooming sort of the the kind we seen ...\nBecame less less feasible really and so the idea that humans would have invented an alternative form of grooming vocal grooming so it would be a way to maintain contact in social bonds with their their friends\nUm and that would leave the hands also free for other tasks\nUm and the idea that that eventually would have evolved into human language\nNow square monkeys for living in group still poop so large but they're actually pretty a social they don't groom ... we expect primates all to do that\nBut they don't actually groom each other they to live in social groups that are large um they don't groom and they talk all the time they're constantly chattering there it's nonstop town when they're forging when they're traveling\n\nSince a science friday I'm Ira Flatow you know every year is salmon\nAnd go on the most important journey of their lives after living years in the wild\nWild oceans they must swim back to the coast to one very particular river mouth and then ... miles of tributaries branches upstream until they finally finally arrive in the little freshwater spring where they were born how did he do this and well like in\nAny good trip yeah you need a map and not just a cop but that's just telling you were in North as you also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to it straight north isn't more north east east than south well you know a few years ago researchers concluded\nThat what if they had long suspected that Pacific salmon can detect\nThe magnetic field lines of beer beer map is they're magnetic and what about their land to dwelling cousins and when you let fish living quiet landlocked blinds you know lived their whole lives with dozens of generations landlocked what happens to that map\nHere to explain more is Michelle Scanlon a faculty research assistant Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me\nYou know I just I just said it but but salmon living impressive lives right they travel all that way how many miles do their journeys tech\n[noise] that that's pretty impressive and their journey can be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds fan and\nUsually ... tiny\nShe may have to find the right stream to go how does he do this ... don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS some store in\n\nThe other side of the men have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reached streams uh they generally would use their sense of smell\nBut in terms of the oceanic journeys and voyages they use something more broad scale and in this term we think they're using magnetic maps and make make information\nNow I Know do your research to looking at a different group of salmon be lapped exam and what what makes them so interesting to you [noise]\nIt was rather interesting opportunity because the land examine that we use for this study are actually descendants\nOf individuals that were transferred from a landlocked lake in\nMaine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery so these fish had never had access to the Pacific ocean and have never sat than outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of the hatchery\nAnd yet you found that they still have the Jew magnetic maps in there that they would have needed that they not been ...\nThat's correct and and\nHow were they able to retain these and why\nThat's an interesting question as to say and then when they use magnetic information they can use different aspects of the magnetic field especially for a map and so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different components one is the strength of the magnetic field\nOr also known as magnetic field intensity and so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator\nAnother aspect of the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth and so they're steeper toward the polls and shallower at the equator and both of these components predict are favorably\nAre predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nThe super convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel flee form a type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nDo they have little magnets in their body that can do them\n[noise]\nBut it's one of the leading hypotheses is that a salmon and other species have tiny chains of magna tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic property\nAnd so these chains of mega tight are associated with nerve cells and the thought is that these chains can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields\nAnd so changes in both the field strength and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials so these structures are thought to be found in the nose and also the latter alliance along the sides of the body of a fish but the men need a receptor itself a is still elusive\nNow why why it important to you and why why does it matter that they can still detect these\nFields [noise]\nWell it's a rather interesting question [noise] so we wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of species that could\nGo to the ocean retain a map sense just to a point of curiosity and\nWe also wanted to know if it lent examine\nAlso possess disability it's another group of individuals that does ethnic maps of diverse amount of no amount of species but we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novels sort of magnetic environments\nOne can they even detect the magnetic field but to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how do they actually respond mhm\nAnd so how did you go about testing research\nSo the eggs from the individuals at the lake in Oregon were transported to the organ hatchery Research Center where they were rewritten subsequently tested\nAnd so we tested these individuals' using a series of magnetic coils and essentially it's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire and when you touch copper wires to an electrical power supply and crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct\nOf that electricity is a magnetic field\nThe really cool part about are coils is that it allows us to alter\nThe direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\nSo what you're doing I Know for my basic physics you know in grade school them if I go to a magnetized object and put it next\nWhat you're doing to the Fisher you magnify them studying beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\nIf there were present them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains of night on tight right that somehow connect within ourselves\nRight and and so having a fish respond to this\nSo we evaluate the movement fish movement by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials\nThought this means is that we are generating thousands of photos\nOf our fish and so we take photos and we assess the position of the fishes head relative to magnetic north\nWow\nThat's terrific and and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean you know how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is a question for future research so we don't know the how finer core scale to mate with one of those maps is yeah\nSo what so speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these fish again\nSo we have a whole number of ... of experiments that we have talked about over the years but one of the experiments would be to actually look I made a magnetic resolution of this map so having a series of points moving them closer and closer together and to see how fine or core scale their responses actually are\nSo uh could you save endangered sermon man by knowing more about them\nI mean it always helps to know more information about us bases that you're trying to conserve them knowing how they're making movement decisions would certainly be helpful and probably a tool\nAnd Sam and conservation but certainly not the only thing that we can go right to serve them yeah well good luck to you and your future experiments All right
