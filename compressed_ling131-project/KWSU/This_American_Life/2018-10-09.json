wasn't something I can completely understand\nPretend it didn't make sense I Would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and I I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean [noise]\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as that are like ... it just floored me I'd I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Marilyn\nPacked already did begin to apply but I didn't\nShe didn't have the courage to [noise] finishers and that sort of you know there's\nThings are [noise]\nA few months after spend received Maryland's email an execution date was that the state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected happened\nGlen and Judith cherry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically Judith cherry presents a statement which reads in part we do not let\nPol stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son\nThey are innocent of his deeds based on this testimony with only five days to spare ... stories execution was postponed when news or the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening\nTo finally respond to Maryland's email but he didn't it's now been over two

unnerved until it has acted upon by an external forces [noise] in other words it takes a little nudge\nAnd who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter [noise] I Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would read and I hope I'm not being too forward [noise]\nAsk Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger [noise] about a week later I received no back via email thank you so much for your letter Maryland right I have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply\nShe also forward to her original emailed and then once you send two years ago when he can stop thinking about [noise] but I read it\nI'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Maryland\nGreat day exclamation mark I understand that fed consumed by guilt would read so much into so little but would I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place\nRegular\nJob I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get packages at all or some\nUh some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK\nBarely lives in Fort Worth Texas that are the two of us meet in the hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering a food but she can't drop

wanted everybody went to people to know you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person every day she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and wearing endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though\nIs that the people who remain the people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and unreliable and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member was our powders to cause a problem with that and that was a very hard for me\nIt's like they wanted everything to be okay but that's my child and I love him and I'm not going to stop fighting for him\nFighting for him men working with her son's lawyers to change your sentence to life in prison\nPow appealed for X dollars thing\nIt took up all
