working here at today's show is a rerun he made a decision to return to his childhood he went searching for somebody named Susan Jordan who he and his sister Kate and their parents knew for about a year when I was growing up in Cincinnati\nThese are the things that I remember about Susan Jordan me and her sitting in the background telling about the day camp I went to that summer I Can't get myself to shut up and they had alligators and snakes I can hear myself telling her and this one time this one alligator got out and the counselor had to catch it and on and on like that [noise]\nMeans

started to fifth grade after being with us for a year and got another job\n[noise]\nLast time I thought it was Christmas Eve Nineteen eighty two [noise] sixteen cashier at thrift wasted supermarket in Cincinnati\nWhere I Lived the place was packed up twenty five registers or going people are lined up halfway through the back of the store\nI looked up and this is Jordan she smiles we talk she doesn't have many items so I checked them through as well as I possibly can't I Can't recall one thing we say to each other although I remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's married\nShe has to be some kind of business card her husband's probably something having to do with the building in redwood deck she seems happy\n[noise] meanwhile there's a line of last minute

drives me crazy that I never saw her again [noise] if I hadn't run into the store I don't think I'd care [noise] somehow an airplane but to me seems like a huge role in my life when I was a kid\nAnd then getting just a taste of what it would be like to talk with her as a peer\nI've never forgotten that my [noise]\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she's not to\nWondering if she ever things about me I just tried to find her\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer for that I Know I'm I'm\nA do you want to know I'm calling I liked your number she's in Jordan right\nGeorge\nYes it's bringing up out but I Can't place\nA she was our babysitter\nOh OK chicken ...\nOne of the many ideas that Susan introduced her household was the concept of the nickname I think that's all I Want to say about chicken legs in a gun to my mother to fill in gaps in my memory of Sudan but she didn't remember much more than I did\nA babysitter that really had more of a relationship\nWhich is that she did with us she seemed to have a very meaningful relationship with you um are the kind of a relationship that you might have like another adult\nAnd I was I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember you so prominent those because I think it worked both ways I think that we felt that that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded and well\nI was desperately I guess I was looking for a family really but I mean it [laughter]\nIf only you knew you probably wouldn't make that I mean that people are complicated\nNow what I really wanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified [noise] I mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy you know a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure that we're [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo he sort of talk to us instead so yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family [noise]\n\n[noise]\nEvery time the subject of a hard time I hear several hundred [noise] was\nThe first I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't exactly it wasn't until we've been talking for hours that I realized what it was [noise]\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop [noise]\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it up and she just forgotten I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been going under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing me do it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had a kind of negative impact on people\nAnd and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids love me blah blah blah [laughter] but uh [noise]\nI Would be devastating if I heard anything different\nParts of the past you don't want to go back to the parts of yourself you don't want to go back to\nThe person who's in Jordan you're protected I remember\nIs he or she just too soon forget [noise]\nAnd also done my best to forget what I was like right there [noise]\nI didn't think of myself as well at all but Susan Jordan reminded me in the gentle terms possible when I was nine and anxious and bookish\nHow to play when I went to your rooms\nI didn't it didn't seem like you had a whole lot of toys I Hope I've got this right but it just seems like there were mostly books and more educational things I mean I remember you had planet in your room at a chemistry set\nAnd I didn't remember that cake had hardly any dolls\nYou didn't seem quite as playful as other kids that I had they not just in more serious than general mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story how little I remember as a defeat the about each other even if they had received us about ourselves\nTo them said at one point each of us remember what we need to do about the other I needed to remember the part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her talking about race departure [noise] she said she must have remembered the side of my family that I just take for granted that it was common our house but there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen that ... people lived differently than the way I laughed and that's what I decided I wanted from I Know\n\n[noise] you can try to return to childhood by looking at ... or visiting the old neighborhood and listening to recording [noise] or you can find someone who knew you back then\nWhen you haven't seen since [noise] they don't carry within themselves picture of you to send clouded by the years between the remember you better than you remember yourself and you could do the same thing

this writing [noise] was powerful and persuasive to anyone who would read it would immediately become millionaires [noise]\n\nSixteen it's such an inflated sense with myself [noise] there was so much going on in my life then that I can remember and I wasn't recorded again instead I was creating this\nRidiculous fantasy of\nYou know I'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and [noise] you know so ... who can't get a girl a kiss him being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that\nBut I don't know I mean maybe the maybe keeping a diary ruin tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe other people in the medical situation need to actually make up a little fantasy yeah I think um\n... confident uncomfortable with it and I had so much a mixed about every other aspect of my life [laughter] I Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be [noise] you know one of the great\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel [noise]\nIt knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people with with getting some of the reading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect\nMillions of people like how is that enough motivation or you know just have your petty little\nCraft and your petty little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nYou know it just seemed to [noise]\nAnd I mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself\nWhat you're saying though is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at your thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at\nSixteen yeah that's very true yeah [noise] it would be very very disgusted to be heard this this radio peace it would seem like I had settled in the ... that are way\nDavid these days staff writer for the\nBoy when we were angels [noise]\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student Hillary frankly studying try and get the New York academy apart and she may out our radio show a story that you wanted to get on to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quotes that she had gotten what you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nFor one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it onto the radio for this week's show however we had to put together another story using that same style which we added music to here at the radio station to make a bully sound like story on our show\nIndustry about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nUniversity it's a pretty straight laced\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nIt's not the sort of place you'd expect people to watch a guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four\nMy friend got with the top half\n[noise] there was beginning of the school year and we were um [noise] got aboard one night and we decided to go up to the quad and [noise] I guess basically got up on a on someone's back and they started yelling and screaming about\nHow giant he was how magnificent and I'm actually right after that I might have gotten a phone back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter]\nAnd uh I guess that really struck a chord in me I thought that was pretty amazing\n[noise]\nBecause I bought a lot about it um it actually good for me thinking along [laughter] killer pat\n[noise]\nGotten talked about the idea one night in the dining hall\nThe next day on the weight of class he saw signs all over him is that in both my him nine feet tall the giant and then eight pm slot [noise]\nThat had no idea who puts him that\nHe learned later that the science were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner\nGot decided he would go to the cloud is it time and undertake the challenge\nHe would need to create a character in a competition for the giants [noise]\nHe gave giant ... boy\nPart even know exactly with something like you know I'm trying to you know just the you know running on loud but just kind of weird [noise] you know sort of [noise]\nThing we ended up [laughter] you know I don't know [noise]\nA blanket wrapped around the middle of the high Toto\nAnd a black curly way like the guy I think\nWe have a point in the bushes put it on at I um [noise]\nBecause I really couldn't see what was going on out of the crowd and for the time came and I got on the shoulder effects way up there like around my waist we walked out and I remember just being maybe you know maybe ten people for people right and I remember them being on the other side and sort of running and it worked so ridiculous about it was\nThe other is like a handful of people and they were so spread out but they're all sort of coming to work for it right you know what the hell am I
