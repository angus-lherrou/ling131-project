hardest in most exotic\nIn two thousand north space sponsored the for them to climb in the minds of Kurdistan\nTo steal the yellow [noise]\n\nBest location on Kurdistan has been popular with backpackers\nEspecially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going on so for about Twenty years before we had gone there there was people traveling there every year had her name and they they got a destination yes\nAnd the climate for you to a massive peaks endangered clear faces but still as their helicopter descended into the care of the valley and the yellow wall came into view they were blown away\nProbably what impact it as an artist that we weren't ready for with me the scale andme ally is just how much bigger than mountains are then everything we have over here at first it was a little bit difficult to wrap our heads around\nThat's Jason Smith he'd put the whole expedition together and when the de facto leader there was John target for that the world class and only female climbing up the group and her boyfriend Tommy he was the youngest of before for tiny yellow while we were big inclined [noise]\nHe was re hadn't been tend to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection to him but I wanted to even if you didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nEnded up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me his rifle\nThat was like wow that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I have very intently gave it to John and I'm sure John do you mind holding this for a minute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up too old hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from the area and he patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\n[noise] they looked at him and it kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like padding among the shoulder and they're like little dog like soldier like they're like you you want to help our cars and\nActually believed that we were trying to help their cars and that we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours to John the photographer tried to communicate to do all asking what the story was here and I've tried to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story with that that we understood\nWhen their group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where and they hurt goes and they ... they might not our business but a third of this guy in their country that's been charged that's\nA really bad guy he likes and soft president for life and [noise] they're not allowed to freely study their religion\nOr something is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time [noise] they won the communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large amendments to install a Muslim state and a handful of my friends went to a group with specific demands like the captors\nTo find a job that we were all going to go to this other place and then his box with getting get on the phone call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this hour and then when we're all going to go home\nThey kept his plan was to focus international attention on the streets and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on rent from a rescue their best shot at living with skate by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned a job that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of that some um [noise] my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember back in myself we're pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just trying to wait it out\nJason a John and wanted to take matters into their own hands\nAnd the idea of killing somebody and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as as a whole and you might to even though you're seeing them murder somebody I very much a\nVictim of circumstance or in some ways a specially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries\nLike I could look at him and be like who's to say that I wouldn't be right there in the same you know doing the same thing you doing [noise]\nJason would talk all day long every day\nIn their schools are stabbed their next with Dick gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is\nVery gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to be for dinner\nIf you're talking about carrying some guys right in front of them you have a very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little tiny or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats and jump on this guy and despite his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker raw and um yeah I was in many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody and others\nMm\nThey marched onto the rocky terrain and one of the characters are ... but now with only two characters with guns to Fort climbers they locked and walked for a whole night in investing for a day and then did again they did that for three\nDays driving and I came up with this really good game to play half the time [noise] um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nHe started imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again and then finally one of his broken asks what time it was when we take guesses and it turns out and then five minutes\nAnd I think that's probably one time he changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I\nMean it was just on comprehend ... we're starving to death we were always shivering and your cheeks were super sore from chattering all the time but then it just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountain trained much better than it does hungry sleep deprived men they could also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd don't seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape it can be came to Jason with a proposal any sense or here's the\nDeal I'm going to go back up to your Base Camp and [noise] I mean against some of the food and clothes and we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men\nWhere we would take to safely up to the mountains where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet at [noise] and then we were all going to go together somewhere that was said\nAnd and obviously in math they bought the story that I spend a week telling till I bought a hook line and sinker [noise] so I grabbed his arm and back then to not [noise] served pleading with him not to go\nIn dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want an became shot and he would have to tear himself away from us we were all grabbing Hammond begging him to knock out he he has this look like he's like no I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off than\nThey split up still tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew led to up the mountain now it went for two months\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode\nThere's just as ball excitement and it was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun and one guy has got to ... and a hand grenade a knife and you've heard of it was like all of that and you have like one down kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very early climate they basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified and that sort of trend especially since there was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately\n\nCommunicated with each other that they would again Ron and this is going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the\nMountain together and I'm always trying to find [noise] uh\nI'm trying all that kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way to also puts him in the most danger if he falls off or gets pushed off\nAnd you can tell that they were there were like this is the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then and then they would it I stopped on a small ledge with bad and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something\nAnd I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything he doesn't believe morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chances of survival [noise]\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of it\nJim and he wasn't expecting it at all um\nBut as I was reaching out to grab it got the job but you sense what was going to happen and he turned towards me up close to him I reached out I grabbed his gun strapping I pulled as hard as I could and he just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of wanting doesn't bark through them in life and he turned and he looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact\nThe whole way down\nAnd so he had the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and\nHis whole body let us really horrible\nCracking down 'cause really loud and then he ... in the dark pants\nAnd I sat down and I just started falling um [noise]\nAnd then bass showed up you know right after that and she sort of sat behind me\nAnd wrap your arms around me and just tried to come from and I was like trembling and I remember I remember ... you know for some reason in that moment I just needed her approval so much throughout this whole thing um\nI liked it I can can just go out and just focus home peddling dropped my head down to like work ahead cranks revolving just felt like one two one two or something like that you're trying to\nYou know you have to such a joy to like find down there\nAnd it's been too with always happy and healthy do\nUntil one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old Spencer started getting headache to ... theory terrible headache and he was diagnosed with an al formation in his brain [noise]\nI mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with grand mal promotions because he was\nCrazy Spencer in Studio ... formation had nothing to do with one [noise] but then to bring to Jewish and didn't seem like it needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery could cause more problems than it would result [noise]\nAnd this was about the time when it's been two became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never had surgery no matter what [noise]\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just across the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm without it then but\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one and how strongly did you feel this way out there about I'd say about it and do you remember what you might have been aired\nI'm just not coming out of surgery as a totally different person I think is what I was scared of\nA different person simply would scare his personality would change which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise] sometimes people experience lots of little changes like different\n[noise] like there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take a picture for is the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family\nIt's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer he's worried that if you changed the green you changed him\n[noise] so I think for Spencer is seeing how I turned out and everything one of them\nAre better for a man made him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery is a country treasure\nEven up to help you know [noise]\nThere was a conversation I had with him at some point [noise]\nExpressing from my regret [noise] about my own stern dreams because I still [noise] have symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every day [noise] time [noise]\nMinute compare it to him that [noise] one of my biggest preventable surgeries on my surgery as an aside [noise] it's made me a [noise] somewhat better person at the time [noise]\nUm [noise]\nCan I get a little skeptical about to go with you there's like a\nContract [noise] okay [noise] um so in like Julie ... story with any of the first\nQuestion who we are so things like our nature are character or so\nI'm Wondering if that same term is by her brain or something like physical and I wonder if that's\nMy only problem in line the intersection of all of those things are more than [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly from hypothetical to their real expensive and having severe headache again and he ended up in the ER and from there he was a helicopter to Harvard Medical center in Seattle\nWhen we first arrived at the hospital my husband and I was just talking butter ... British and [noise]\nThe restarted ivy and there for a few minutes as I watched him try to catch it ... I I I thought we witness and\nIt was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles and got to spend ... hospital room in the scene [noise] to feed him [noise]\nIn a coma in a condition than I Am hopeful only I Would have to have dealt with and [noise]\nI Wish I could have been union [noise]\nOh [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise] going to take a short break and we will return Spencers family as they make the decision but no family should ever have to make one step judgment override episode continue day [noise]\n\nNorthwest public broadcasting bases program support from listeners like you additional support comes from the Moscow food co-op located downtown\nThis October is national co-op mobbed focused on cooperative values and commitment to community in Moscow food co-op is celebrating with events activities throughout the month but details about each week posted on Facebook\nFind that guy sitting behind a wall of bullet proof slap in the liquor store\nSomeone put a curse on my how my family and I need something to\nJoin us for more true stories told [noise]\nTiara [noise]\nListen to them all three of our\nIt's coming up later today at one o'clock here on northwest public broadcasting right now you are tuned into snap judgment [noise]\n\nSnap judgment is supported by target presenting future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing in communities nationwide future at heart available on apple pie cats or wherever\nWelcome back to step judgment override episode when I was in Washington\nAnd we left off young man Spencer he laid conscious some hospital because of the melt formation in his brain it's all the family knew was that no matter what he never ever wanted to have brain surgery\nCenter and had a strip mall he lay in the hospital bed to date in the family to mom and dad Steven as British still had to decide what you mean they had to decide whether or not to operate [noise]\nThey're surgeons name is Dr Keim Dr Kim told them that if they did not operate now they were the one to five percent chance that they would have another strip and that chance would increase every year the light [noise]\nBut the surgery he was proposing with very risky when Dr Kim with explaining very daunting odds any recording him\nBecause you could go back and listen to what he said over and over\nBut it's a procedure though it was it had some risk associated with it about\nFive to ten percent of the major complications from surgery or mine or ... or anything in between\nI Know that the surgery for the past [noise]\nI think that this is what you actually dramatic changes and we know now with all that you know what would you want to do and I think that the physician I'm putting your guys' dream is to make that determination nobody in the world knows him better than freebies\nSo it's not what you want or what I Want to rent or my mom or dad\nHave you ever performed another surgery with a cup of coffee about what I heard of the range of actually yeah that'll change and not be covered by many that are the sort of almost like you know\nThere's ... it's not a theoretical risk is the real risk is if it happened to those particular surgeries which are drawn to that area what was the outcome of your\nFace and ... percent of them five to ten percent of them will have a bad outcome\nOne that they wish they hadn't done the operation\nAnd you'll go crazy trying to convince yourself that you can figure out if he's going to have a conversation and you can't just keep going around in circles wondering like well\nYeah I think it's important that actual decision but it's also an intuitive one I think the best decision to life you have to feel good about it's not just in your rationalizing and so forth all fears and listen to your gut instinct\nKim Luft have room any like Steve do instead", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city": "Pullman", "day": "13"}
