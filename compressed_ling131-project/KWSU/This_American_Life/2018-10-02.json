one girl Lindsay she had to have friends in common\nSo they decide to pair up room together and ride the bus together to be orchestra\nSo um when we go to Seattle and we're like it's awkward you know because we're like new friends trying to get to know each other and um and on one of our free days they send us to the Space Needle\nAnd I don't know if you've ever been to the Space Needle house

hundred coincidence stories interviewed dozens of people\nHere just a few things we've learned here most prone to coincidences when you're young teens early twenties lots of coincidences involve your grandmother you're likely to experience a coincidence if you're in or near the Netherlands coincidences also happen to you in or near airplanes or on Craig's list\nFor many of you coincidences where the answer to your prayers are how'd you find you're missing bike also there are coincidences hidden in your name your keys you're close your address we heard stories about a lost roll of film

said because that's my phone number\nThat's Mike on the phone number that you just made up is actually my phone number [noise]\nThese stories reminded me of an old Chinese saying I once heard\nActually I wanted a couple of weeks ago and I have no idea how old\nIt is but it goes like this food shelter ... that's my friend un U. N. D. food shelter ...\nAnd what if any\nIf there's no coincidence ... story\nNo coincidence no story to imply that of course life's Earl\nTo develop in ways that we can predict so is it like if you heard a story with a coincidence afterwards you might be like no coincidence no story like that right yes just the expression you use it to quote I feel like a corny thing to say mostly I think of no it won't be on this do you ever use it [noise]\nWhen corneas [laughter]\nOr the risk of being corny I'm going to say at today's show no coincidence no story while the ... the way we're going to sneak these coincidence stories on there\nAll the stories you'll hear today first aired on our show twenty Thirteen [noise] and they're all verified true stories that my colleague hid from me until the actual interview so wouldn't spoils the prize which is also why there is so much unprofessional giggling this hour\nAnd full disclosure I came into this topic a coincidence skeptic bleeding that a coincidence is just a coincidence nothing more [noise]\nI judged I confronted weakness I countered wide eyed faith with statistical probability and by the end [noise] well [noise] they would [noise]\nGrandma's [noise] like Oliver is living in Nicaragua right now we talked on Skype\nAbout four months ago he was on the phone to his friend Camille who goes by Kenny he mentioned that the screen saver on his iPhone had been the same picture for a long time that he wanted to change it\nBut I asked her to I'm just sent me a picture of something uh-huh and and it was really funny she ended up sending me this picture of her as little kid as a joke and it was like oh yeah kind of funny [noise] we ... back into the funny [noise] and then I went back\n[noise]\nSo how's the weather says nothing goes home for later that night she tells her daughter this was the one this was the man who might have been [noise] she explained that the reason they hadn't\n[noise] oh that ended up living in the U.

[noise]\nYeah there's something about it the fact that you know I didn't have the time with my dad that I wished I had yeah\nAnd then suddenly to kind of have him be kind of an active part of my life again to think that uh I can talk to my mother in law and hear what he was like in his twenties something that my mom doesn't even know\nAnd you know it might actually help his father is a strong believer in the idea that somehow my dad is somehow is behind all this that somehow\nYou know he's kind of help make all this happened [noise]\n\nAt the time this next story takes place a guy named ... was working in a Chicago suburb called Arlington heights he just started dating a woman named after they'd been out maybe eight times\nI thought maybe it was time to\nGet exclusive or become boyfriend girlfriend or whatever it was and it was about to go out to lunch and I was thinking about asking you're on a friday date today and I'm set up\nAnd I went out to lunch with stopped at the

found that the frame with the dollar in it and I stuck it up on the dresser and she came in the room I said hey [noise] um [noise] you never told me about this hour what's the deal with that she said well\nWhen I was Eighteen you know as a cashier working in a copy shop in downtown Chicago\nAnd I was dating someone and I just wasn't happy with him and I just\nThought you know how do people know\nWho the right person that they're meant to be this how do they how do they know who that is\nI said you know and I'm not going to worry about that I'm just gonna put my name on the dollar bill and the guy that gets a dollar bill is going to be the guy that asks me to marry him and I'm like well you can't just write them your name I Want actually I think it was more like maybe ten or twelve\n[noise] and so the dollar bill that you gave to I Believe in that same dollar bill that I wrote my name on and I knew that we were going to be married to a data you gave me the dollar\nThe details on change is the same story like he couldn't I think he was a little bit beside themselves that that actually happened and that I didn't tell [noise]\n\nYou know I I I don't know how I found the well to not say anything to 'em but I just remember like do I don't I Do I don't do it you know what do I do I don't want to treat this guy out and\nBe like why does cause already talking about Mary wait why forget it [laughter] [noise]\nYou know I don't read too much into almost anything so I just got to move forward in an after she told me I think I went through all the the normal stages or whatever and I just thought what does this mean for us are we going to invent a time machine or our kids going to bring world peace or like well what about like some sort of bigger\nThings that we're not seeing here [noise]\n\n\nNow just sits in that very same frame up on our address or and I look at it every day but I wake up [noise]\nSometimes I reminder that we have it [noise]\nOne she's upset at me and\nIt's never been a question in my mind like you know what I'm going to get this kind of the curve\nBut but I Do believe it's because of his dollar that I felt that type to um I mean obviously I Love him but I think that if it ever did cross my mind I'd\nBe like the way I this is\nMy soul mate I Can't just walk out on him you know we don't we don't even wear wedding bands I'm like why just [noise] I Know I'm stuck\nWith you know you got the dollar bill [laughter]\nI guess he could also you know put it back out into the register and it'd be like like I'm catching than [laughter]\nI think it's got to go to somebody else you could do that\n[noise]\nPaul and Esther ... had been married for Nineteen years [noise] ago a\nYoung man [noise]\n\nYou don't give you [noise]\n\nThere's a lot of um [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] three brothers can you spare a dime this story comes from Ryan rows are in Los Angeles\nIt happened when I was in college um I was actually pledging a fraternity and I ran into some of the like the seniors tend to um on campus and they were laughing about something and so one of them tells me the story that had happened to him that day supposedly\nWhere he gets in the shower and about five ten minutes into a shower he hears a team and he looks down and sitting on the floor of the shower between his feet is a nickel\nAnd has no idea where this mythical came from or you know why it's there are you know obviously like we like everyone's making jokes but you know he had changed falling out of his\nBut [laughter] you know people were like where are you eating dollar bills or you know\n[laughter] but anyway we our laps and I I go home and I don't think much about it the next day I get in the shower and like five ten minutes into my power I hear it and I looked down and write between my he is a quarter\nSo my first thought was you know how did they do it like my thought was totally assumed that this must not have really happened to him that was set up and somehow they set this up that happened to me but I could not figure out how much just like you know they have to be a prank basically\nYeah there's some girl nothing on the west side of town for the last couple of days so my God so down what are her just sort of drop and you had known that hadn't been on the news or something like we had no idea [laughter]\nSo we we just kind of got scared at that point\nCan I can I just I was like in its history you gonna get funny or is this a horrifying story we actually don't have any I don't tell me\nI'm so she called another officer and the other officer\nComes there's a couple cars\nAnd they both get out and tell us to get out and they say okay wait at the bottom [noise]\nSo we're waiting they go walking [noise]\nAnd it's dark so we can't really [noise]\nSee them that well but we can see them well enough and we don't really want to watch what's going on because we see them\nAnd I'm trying not to look but of course I'm working [noise]\nHold up the human figure out of the whole [noise]\nAnd then she says it's a mannequin [laughter] [noise]\n\nI don't know what my friends in but I was sitting there thinking own like [noise]\nHow does this story ended up okay you know other than in any universe you know like [noise]\nUnless you say the man [laughter]\nJeff goes to school on Monday tells his story in physics class\nAnd the kid next to him says that was that we did\nWe went around stealing holiday decorations and we had to get rid of them so we stopped them under the manhole cover American by the way had been the Virgin Mary and someone's negativity\nCaused this to happen or they were good friends here though [noise]\nNo Jeff turns out that is not the real coincidence of the story my producer Brian Reed was listening to all these interviews as they were happening and he interrupted us to tell us we both missed the point where I just pointed out that I miss you and I are both committed to bring it back on my own story are submitted it we're going\nTo the main coincidences there's a girl missing at the same time\nHave five words for you drop food shelter ...\nNo coincidence no story\nHere the definition of coincidence that seems right to me a coincidence is a surprising concurrence of events perceived as meaningfully related with no apparent causal connection if the middle part meaningfully related that people seem to get stuck on because one of ... line up just so\nYou can't help it you can't help but wonder if there's a message in that\nIn that way coincidences are kind of like short cut to a very big question about fate about God even people who don't believe in either one\nThe notion that somewhere out there someone or something is paying attention to your life that there might be a plan conjured drew coincidences that notion seems to be most appealing when you're young [noise] the daughter of a jazz guitarist named Andy Riley wrote to us about the time when she was Nineteen she's listening to an Ella Fitzgerald album\nI was listening to the song that old black magic\nAnd at the end of the song Ella chosen a line that old black magic that Daniel Scott me in and I've heard her say that light on that album dozens of times before and wondered who's been again yes but on this particular day for some reason I felt inspired to go out to the living room and ask my dad\nTo bill Daniels was and he explained that in the forties the bill Daniels had some old like magic in a way that made it his song and he was referred to as Mr Black magic I guess back in the forties and\nIt was a big deal at the time and\nI'd asked my dad had you met him you know did you ever know Billie Daniels and he said that began you know she's probably dead now and just\nLiterally at that moment the phone rang [noise] joy after the phone and this playful gravelly voice asked for Andy Riley [noise] and I said who's who's calling and he said but he didn't [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] so last\nFor like the last time\nThis was at a ... percent when this happened she was Twenty years old on drugs hanging out with street kids her mom offered to buy or a bus ticket to Washington state to go to rehab and said yes she took her dog and got on the bus\nIn Los Angeles there was a stopover at the ... and this guy comes up to her well she's waiting in line to get food she got two dollars just enough for some French fries the guy starts asking her questions about her dog\nAnd he starts asking the other hand them questions like what do you do on where you're going in and then he asked me are you from Alaska and I'm like uh yeah I Am actually\nAnd then he asked me if your mom they make and I was like um mhm yeah she is you look oh well on Chris I'm your father I met you ten years ago and I'm like oh holy\nAnd if it only seen her father that one time briefly and she was eleven\nAnd then he pulled out a big wad of money and I keep pace and my food and then he has a forty bucks and it's like don't than ever gave enough and and walked away\n... [laughter]\nI'm like shocked by the story and he didn't that was it you didn't see him again he didn't know\n\nIf you could tell he fell ... did you expect something were to happen like did you think oh yeah I I really there's not going to go\nLike sit down and eat together I was going to lay out her whole life story for him and if it's going to\nPlaying his life where where then I was kind of looking forward to that but that didn't happen not fair to say I want to study it safe for longer 'cause that's\nLike I mean I've seen it twice and I I still can't really remember what it looks like do you regret\nNot not pursuing him in some way\nYeah absolutely\nAnd the moment I was just you know so I just really couldn't comprehend what sort of thought on the bus and I was kind of like why didn't I run after him [noise]\nI've spent my whole life wondering how this man and you know the chance to talk to him was put right in front of my face [noise] I didn't really understand that at the time and I let it go [noise]\nMm\nGarcia Sarnoff also hadn't seen his father and many years\nWhen he was Eighteen and they have to the top of a pyramid their whole place is sort of off the beaten track\nOr walking walking along the ... people died in front of us and my mom said oh my God ... and then she turned to me that's that's your father um that's your dad and I was\nAlso coincidentally it was Father's Day\nI I ended up sort of acting like breaking down and cry on that pyramid I was really emotional moment for me my father definitely you know his accent meant a lot\nAnd we said yeah we're going to stay in contact and after they buy they laughed at she came running back up the hill about twenty minutes later and you can hear him parenting and he said\nReally I don't know I just want to say I'm Sorry I didn't stay in touch and\nThat I Love you and he turned and went back down on them\n\nAnd the only on a story goes away at a wishes hers had gone after rocky few years he and his father did get to know each other and each other's family had a son and you know how to grandfather million his father had left him when he was a baby but when his father died some years ago a millionaire was there at the hospital\nThat had a real relationship and that never would have happened a millionaire said if you hadn't seen him that day at the pyramid\nWalking down that pyramid I was talking to myself and I was saying like I don't this is one is ... advertising forget don't drink you know just started getting rid of my future though which I knew would rational\nAs this event you know 'cause I I had the varied\nSense but felt that if this was actually a miracle something the energy and brought us together you know you don't just run into your father on top of the pyramid [noise] so I think I was a believer for about a week um and then\nUm and then that very pause that brings us back five what are the chances [noise]\nOrder to let a good coincidence live a long and healthy life to get told and retold and take its rightful place and the narrative of your life sometimes you have to stop yourself from thinking it all the way through why it happened really is the fact is any statistician will probably rain on your parade will tell you these things happen a lot more often than you think\nThat a good coincidence is like a good magic trick when you see one struggling sous instantaneously between the thrill of the parent miracle any urge to debunk it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city": "Pullman", "day": "02"}
