[noise] but [noise] these\nThings don't stop happening [noise] they just continue to happen [noise]\n\nThese shootings do just continue to happen [noise]\nDid they not presently have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare like the staff at the school [noise]\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shooting it'll pass to dissipate the future [noise] knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she didn't get into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough activity at people who invented something that actually seems to work and help\nFrom WBEZ in Chicago is American I Am\n\nHeck line Betty as you'll never be pretty sure that they're trying to figure out the best way to prepare for gunmen there's an example\nBefore the shooting that killed Seventeen people in the school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation has come after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning and the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think they could have been more prepared than the worst day and I mean they knew what to do we knew what to do and and even still even with that and he still has that nicotine\nCasualties haven't been able to I'm going to return to their family\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question when our producers Robin ... went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school with an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergency bomb threats hurricane mornings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDoug lifted the school with eleven building than over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she didn't enthusiastic teacher a planner\nShe believes in a good hard thank being proactive once she and other teachers have been trained they ran their students are all the new drills all school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class to get there going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures they said what we do for ...\nEvery period forever and this is what occurred black and\nThat is what we do for two days or two days we went over the procedures with\nThe kid might you have to deal with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids [noise] knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in their mind and that they knew they were asked to non silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nWill color stuff over there on an alternating schedule [noise]\nWas it that their kids to the drill seriously\nI ... I Would say we were totally prepared like attacking\nTold every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors of paper\nAnd leave the paper up all year just in case if there were on\nBefore Columbine very few schools did active shooter drills now nearly Twenty years later most of them do\nActually curse teaches calling area Douglas she's level headed pragmatic like a person who spent years working in the restaurant kitchen not living are cool but she did actually remembers being trained but the other teachers on the new procedures last year it started with almost nine to nine one one audio from Sandy Hook\nThe audio versions of the I Believe if I remember correctly it's at the front office and one of the ladies that called in with the shooter is outside the door and you can hear her like her voice drops when she was like he's right outside he's run inside and you can hear the the dispatch officer telling her you know don't move and be quiet\nShe realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building um yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the town how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nAnd he wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people and\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was laughing there were terrified people running and I just I could not in all consciousness\nAnd leave them leave and be like that\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice that um\n[noise]\nIn her classroom looked at that are attendant sheet out of her emergency folder and she kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway group it small enough to sit in the ... the month of told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and move them\nIn the closet it was hot and dark except didn't basis by their cell phones and once I had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and on my friend Stacy who is on the side for the freshman building she ... she's on the tax cuts that says there is a shooter there was a shooter in my floor\nUm and so my my friend Ferris says drill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet thank God and I didn't hear from her for a while an hour away and I we heard noises in the hallway\nAnd we got really quiet um I had to have a flashlight part of my phone on because we can kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open but it sounded like he was opens with a key um\nAnd what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police than you went in here\nAnd then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police if anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because [noise]\nSomeone says it's it's a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not sure the first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really felt because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to get about whether to trust us with a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were caught and so I just\nVery slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it up and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started you know giving us instructions come out with your hands that [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] what they're told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy hold her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yelled to you know not being able to close the door and crabs to handle with two hands and pulled the close\nUm [noise] to her door would open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway [noise]\nBasically it's the teacher who are most grade [noise] she survived [noise] got Beagle and the room next to this day seized at the same things they ceded\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in a store way\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting trails of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we can talk about them are still statistically rare but now more than actually has been in that rare situation someone that's hard to study and they both told me that having\nA playbook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class [noise] now I moved out to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of it about ways they could have been better prepared Melissa for instance\nOne of trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it\nDoes actually has they've lived the mass shootings\nDid more kids arrive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson researches what's effective in these drills a baby or university and the training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. the train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfit safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also code ran all the codes their colors and meanings\nCan some by talked to said no to that too I'm a big advocate for not using codes and all\nI if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to go a code red meat bad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I said there's a gunman in the pool [noise] keeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet [noise]\nBut the idea that this is all you do you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting [noise] sometimes you Daniel room [noise] sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym [noise]\nAs a last resort and you cite basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise]\nI told her about actually occurs how she's the doorway grabbing of dozens of students from ever the break from her school's protocol [noise] Cheryl such an advocate\nFor thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling in ... the problem with\nThis and unless you're there you don't know [noise] you know what exactly happened\nNow does she probably save lives probably in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes one thing that was part of the training at Douglas barricade in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door but most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did actually had done\nIt and she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away it would have been way harder to pull the kids into her room from the hallway\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school my daughter's nine fourth grade [noise]\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school when I\nWhen I asked her what the journalists before she said I don't know exactly and say [noise]\nI keep thinking about that one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and how that one classroom a student at a traditional lockdown squatting high because they packed that [noise]\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me that Israel did not help them at all [noise] that have been better off without it [noise]\nAnd the researchers who told me we should not do drills at school period\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instruction [noise]\nI don't agree with no drills at all [noise] but my daughter to know everything [noise]\nAllowed her to know about barricaded and I want her to know about running and fighting back [noise]\nI Want her to know that active shooters because the thing to recognize [noise]\nI Want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOne more thing I'd say to my daughter's school ... point about don't take codes\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom and tell my daughter code red\nI Want someone to say listen I as a person with a gun in our school of course I never want someone to say that at all\n\nIf you're at tackling their new gate new fences new cameras Jim back searches key card entry for staff Godzilla trauma kits and every ram Fifteen campus monitors compared to five last year\nThree school resource officers instead of one and they already did a code red trail only this time there was no confusion about what it would be\nControl Marilyn Manson going on in the world goes away it's not going to change their district for enjoy strong doors are so able to just\nDo you plan to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year so those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in the second amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of gun ammunition and factories like bump stocks I personally by\nHowever than he said they don't push their political beliefs on survivor when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support\nBut it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement a conspiracy theorists who believe that the U.S government staged mass shootings to make conflict that we were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of course is famous for saying that mass\nShootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the fill up the\nTwo minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living in the high life in your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of him it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy stepped in broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nThere's truth there's are hopes are troll families of victims on social media\nImmediately after any mass shooting is can get dangerous after that Philips is on gave interviews and Aurora it got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man he was writing him ended up in jail cell hoaxes or one of the things that Philips and foreign parents about they tell families to brace themselves\n[noise]\nAfter watching mommy and daddy in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts to their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time\nShe got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Japanese prime called Sandy from the theater the minute I picked up the phone\nThere was [noise] screening just [noise]\nArnold screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting and what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but she's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I trashed\nThat's what I woke up because the screen was so low it was so horrific\nWe took her to their couch ray hunter\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people were injured\nAnd then five months later there was another mass shooting\nOr twenty first graders and six educators died [noise]\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted this up says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents there\nAnd he said they didn't even have to think about it they need at least said yeah because they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown and he says they felt nervous\nUncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their faces [noise]\nHe said that's what we look like five months ago\nWhich is that look like [noise]\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving but they're not really there\nI realized that's when I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back and he said it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to confront other parents when they were still so raw but the Philips who thought there was also a strong and in some sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from [noise]\nWhile they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings you parents from Virginia attack in Tucson these parents had lost kids suddenly and violently places where they thought that they were safe to Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moment that launched the filter into what's become their life's work they can see the need there no experts on what to do when your child died in a mass shooting [noise] the only experts are the people it's happened to [noise] to help them find each other money and he set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their three\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills in cherry scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state [noise] however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend [noise] they want you to move on what you want you to get back\nYou know let me explain something you're right I'm not the same person who will be they see it as we're obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are just within\nThe Philips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand but the grief never escape [noise] old relationship start to fall away [noise] people who were closest to disappear\nWhich makes this informal support groups even more critical [noise] without support looks like over time what it means to the parents to get it I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida lost her son and a shooting in Parkland on a kitten next door at\nAnd let them at their house or something with Nick he was the captain of Parkland twin team was about to go to the University in Indianapolis on a twin scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops Mitt said they just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together today the shooting Mitch an ... phone\nCalls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nick with okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting and others at a police officer with giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital that she thought patient mash next description [noise] by that evening the door at still hadn't heard directly from that they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as immediate area\nIs that in the ballroom with other parents can waited\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped in thinking that calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was calling you give any comment can we help you find your son and I should say [noise]\nAnd um at two o'clock in the morning the the FBI cars and then they start pulling one family into a room at a time and he has like strange from nature and then their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like ... we couldn't even find yourself and you know and I hope that she was arrested\nAnd I'm taking keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to our house and then they told us the news that he was ... he was shocked and he was never brought to the hospital\nSecond nightmare\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene\n... says this is just how her brain works she's an ER nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about neck\nAnd the person that answered the phone and said oh I'm let me let me take a look what's the name again is Nicholas where it is a swimmer swimmers perfect [noise] I think is meant that there was nothing on his face or his head like hips even perfect\nHe'd been shot three times a bullet in his tax destroyed his heart and lungs for you to see him\nYes he let helpful because your picture in your head when you hear when you hear that somebody has been shocked with an era Fifteen just so gross something so horrible horrible and I think to see him and to see on his body where his injuries were\nWere um\nMade me get it like he was so peaceful and he was not in pain and it made me have a better image of him that the one that was playing over
