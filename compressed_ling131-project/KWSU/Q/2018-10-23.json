clear skies learn and thirty [noise] I'm planning on and tell us it's ada that [noise]\n[noise]\n\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson in Washington it's Monday that means it's time for a special series ahead of the midterms called the state where in\nThis week we're looking at state trends inlaws on unions involving the public sector workforce like teachers firefighters and government employees they make up one of the most heavily unionized sectors of America's workforce\nBack in June the Supreme Court passed a ruling that could make it harder for unions to secure labor contracts through a process known as a collective bargaining the ruling affects more than twenty states and the consensus is it the decision will hurt unions financially and could lead to a further decline in membership\nAhead of that ruling some blue states took steps to protect organized labor what impact\nJoining us here in Studio to discuss it is Scott Greenberger executive editor of state line a journalism project of the Pew Charitable trusts Scott welcome back to what ... thanks very much for having me let's get some definitions out of the way first of all when we say collective bargaining what are we referring\nTo [noise] uh when we say collective bargaining or what we're talking about our negotiations between uh employers and a group of employees are on salaries benefits working conditions and the like and typically employees are represented by unions\nKind of basic wages and working conditions exactly now a number of states have a right to work laws on the books that are called right to work states what exactly do we mean by right to work\nSo a right to work a states and there are about to I think twenty seven twenty eight of them now uh they prohibit labor unions and employers from requiring workers to pay union dues as a condition of employment\nUh and of course the union dues are extremely important because that enabled the unions to not only um conduct the negotiations during collective bargaining but also a to engage in other activities including a political activities\nSo if you are at a job at a a union covered workplace typically you know what I mean in a non right to work state you get that job and you join the company and they say hey welcome to this job were covered by union here's your initiation fee you need to pay\nIn a right to work state you can get the job and say no thanks I'm not eager to pay for this but I look forward to starting work that's right\nHow does union membership look in the U.S right now are we talking mostly about public sector workers like teachers more private sector workers like hotel workers some of whom are on strike right now with the overall picture\nSo uh this picture has changed dramatically in the last several decades it used to be in this country that most ah when we talked about unions we were talking about private sector unions\nBut a union membership overall has declined significantly over the last several decades and now public sector employees make up a larger share\nOf a unionized workers in the United states so right now about a third of public sector workers and we mean we say public sector sector workers we're talking about teachers police officers firefighters\nA government employees in St agencies about a third of them are unionized and only about a six point five percent less than seven percent of workers and the private sector are unionized and an overall\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the Annenberg Foundation committed to supporting

bargaining but now won't have to pay for that\nSome blue state solve this decision coming in preemptively pass legislation to protect unions from a high court's ruling were discussing that and more issues related to state laws on unions with Scott Greenberg executive editor of state line Sarah Duncan is still with us on the line she's a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates and she has a case from a visual arts teacher\nSarah there was one more thing I did want to ask you before we had to let you go we heard from a number of listeners\nAbout their thoughts on being in unions not every teacher is satisfied with the union that they're in grants and I can't think of any union that makes all of its members happy but we did hear from John in San Diego who left this voice mail in our inbox\nI'm a member of a teacher's union and while I Do appreciate all the things that the union negotiations or us on our athletes salary health insurance\nThat kind of stuff um I Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent it higher level Caesar accountability that will ultimately lead to higher salaries more competition within the profession I feel that sometimes wants teachers achieved\nTenure that's negotiated underneath of the union contracts\nThat were unable to continue to drive competition and the teacher market and ultimately compare ourselves to other business areas where competition drives salary growth\nJohn thanks very much for getting in touch with Sarah I'm Wondering what you think of John's commented does he have a point to unions allow workers to sometimes rest on their laurels\nWell and I'd like to make a couple of comments about that first off I've not always been happy with everything that mining and has done but one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union\nIs the numbers the union is not just your union leaders ... are driven by numbers and lenders and need to demand\nAnd you know what they want to see the union do also I Would say I think there's some misunderstanding about you know teacher hiring practices and firing practices and it's actually not\nThat difficult to fire a teacher but what Indians has done is made it clear that you can't just fire a person for no reason you do have to give them due process you have to observe than you have to evaluate them you can't just say well we don't\nAnd it's because teachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay and if we did not have that due process in place you would see a lot of teachers let go simply because they make higher salaries and you you know counties can save money by not keeping those teachers around\nBefore I let you go Sarah I Know that your goal is to get into West Virginia house of delegates in and try to work with the other delegates about improving\nPolicies for teachers what about West Virginians do you think that residents of your state are really motivated to see the kinds of changes you're trying to bring about I mean if they were motivated than I Wonder if it would have taken the strike to make things happen in West Virginia\n[noise] I think that they are I'm not if they did and I do believe that that is why the strike was so successful we could not have done what we did without the support of our communities\nAnd I think that our communities realize you know it was portrayed in the media is that this strike was just it out hey are just about health care it's not about that\nNot just about that it's about improving conditions for students for teachers for families and for working people in general and I had seen with my own eyes legislators are repeatedly putting the interest that outside corporate interests\nOver their own people in this state and that is what I Want to stop\nSarah dumping a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates also a visual arts teacher Sarah we appreciate your making time for us thanks very much thank you without a few more voices to the conversation now but first let me read a few of your comments bill in Cleveland emailed\nI don't think workers should be forced to join a union but also don't think that those who choose not to join should receive the benefits of the union's efforts\nNon union members should go it alone and individually negotiate their pay and benefits with their employer you can't have it both ways\nLuke tweeted how we govern unions seems to be the wrong question if working conditions were good or fair equitable enough unions would be a necessary so maybe ask how do we govern employers\nScott I think we should be clear with regard to bill from Cleveland ... comment about non union members going it alone and individually to go shooting just to be clear for people who've never been part of a union\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but a union contract is a floor not a ... it's the basic wages and working conditions workers can negotiate for more if they want but a union contract kind of sets the minimum the basis for all the workers working conditions right I Believe that's the case I mean there's a lot of very\nAnd the sort of um [noise] uh about differences that you were talking about\nI Know someone that we should put that question too I think is an expert on drugs out and she's joining us from NYC in New York Randi Weingarten is the president of the American federation of teachers which is the second largest teachers' union in the U.S Randy welcome to one day\nHey Joshua and that Sarah and Sarah is one of these awesome members and I she's running in and very ... district and I hope she makes that front of the three hundred teachers is running\nI Do want to talk to a little bit more about that in the moment I should also union's contract I actually I don't have a new contract so I said also introduced Vincent for new CIO he's a senior fellow at the Mackinac Center for public policy and senior policy adviser at the state policy network and he joins us from Michigan Radio Vincent welcome\nHey thank you for having me on ... I was gives me Randy before we continue could I just put that question to you in terms of members going it alone just for the sake of clarity a collective bargaining agreement is a floor it's not a ceiling you could negotiate for more but the point of a CPA is to say these are at least the minimum working conditions and wages right well\nUm it's in in some in some industries it's a Florida ceiling\nIt depends on what the clause is about ... flu city um and the beginning clauses of a union contract sometimes is for everyone and sometimes it's a floor and sometimes\nIt covers all of the conditions of um of employment including pay okay so it it it it changes from place to place it's not monolithic\nOkay good that's that's that's a good con a context is for folks maybe who never been in a union to know that it can be that they're they're mileage may vary Vincent you you have said that the oral arguments in the gym is case that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier led to the teachers strike this spring house so\nWell that's right but before we get to that let's just go back to find exactly what right to work isn't exactly what Janice brought to public employees across the country\nAll right to work all Janice means is that a union can't get a worker fired for not paying them it doesn't affect collective bargaining in any other way unions workers can still negotiate with employers over wages hours working conditions anything they could before right to work before ...\nThey can negotiate for after it except for the ability to say you're ... you must pay us or you're fired and going back to that contract is a floor at not at all\nAnd you already built to enter the only way to get a raise is by logging another year or other jobs can I just am all the way to go ahead and finish off um so I I I actually agree with Bill um you know workers should have the ability to negotiate individually if they want to the Mackinac center has model legislation it's called the workers choice\nThat allows public employees to fully opt out of union representation represent themselves and negotiate a better contract if they can\nIf union workers if unionized workers don't pay unions to negotiate for them how can that not have an impact I mean you have to pay the staff to negotiate for your right\nOr the problem is that they are forced to accept that representation whether they want it or not I don't know I hear\nYou on that I I I hear you on that piece I just want to make sure we're clear on the argument you're making if the staff to negotiate your contracts he's paid and there are workers who choose not to pay into that staff how could that not have an impact I mean you got to pay these people right\nWell it's a staff of doing good job I mean I worked for a contract for nonprofits and they raised there and they raise the revenue by doing good job and having um their supporters realize they're doing good job proving that are worth to their supporters\nAnd out raising money that way so if the unions are doing your job I'm like we've seen in right to work states like we are seeing now after Janice if they prove their work to their membership\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Americans for the arts committed to transforming America as communities through the arts and arts education supporting the nonprofit arts

and Vincent for new show before we keep going Scott there was a statistic you shared earlier that I think he wanted to clarify just to make sure we got it right yeah I just want to declare\nOur fighters or an and other government workers where union members um as of two thousand seven so\nNot just those jobs were covered by union membership Dr ... thank you very much clarify to Randy you wanted to react to ... voice mail from Ohio Go ahead\nCrate and my apologies that by a hundred stuff that I you\nOverheard all are given it as you\nSaid look you know I Know we live in a world\nWhere you know truth and fact no longer seem to matter but let me just throw out a couple of things for county was saying\nIs that in the private the privatization in Ohio lead to less safety and bus drivers and or and bus um transport\nThe privatization in charters led to it's a huge issue in the Ohio governor's race right now because this\nVirtual charter called each cat meaning\nUm a charter that said it was I'm serving Twenty one thousand kids\nFleece the taxpayers of Ohio by somewhere between a hundred million to a billion dollars and the wind evidently was the attorney general during this period of time and didn't take this issue seriously and Cordray is making it a big issue and people are really upset about it\nI think that what happens is that unions sometimes up we we become the voices people\nAnd people on the other side don't like it sometimes like the divorces like the Koch brothers\nBut it is the difference between being stronger together which is what ... saying\nVersus going it alone and and people who are rich can go it alone most of us can't and that's why frankly union membership and my union is up in the last ten years by about two hundred and fifty thousand people because people feel stronger together even when we all kind of debate\nAt our conventions what our policy should be it has to be democratically based and it has to be about the value of what we do for not only are members but for kids\nWe heard from some of our listeners about membership going up in the Jacob emailed I'm an ... shop steward with local one twelve and an employee with the state of Maryland post genocide we've seen very few members opt out and in fact we appear to be seeing more interest in our union\nRandy I Wonder if we could back up to something that Vince ... said earlier up a point that you made in terms of being required to pay\nIs the host of this program and this is not work that I Would do for free\nBut the the plurality of the work that I Do is funded by the public deciding that one a as something they want the W. A. amuses station they care about and so they choose to give and so the barometer we have\nOf whether we're doing what people want to use their willingness to become members to become sustaining members to give to write a singer wills to donate their cars to be you know cashed out to to support the station\nIt feels like a similar argument with folks in right to work states where they say if unions are doing what they are members want them to do you have to compel them to pay their dues they will pay gladly because they'll know what they're getting from the union they can't get on their own it's absolutely essential what's wrong with that argument\nSo Joshua it's frankly the arguments and the point that Janice case has ... has decided\nThat you know everything is completely voluntary the argument used to be this that if you are creating a staff and I'm an entity that is a bargaining contracts and representing all of everyone\nThen it shouldn't just be the people with the loudest voices\nThat get the attention it should be everyone who gets the attention and that just like in terms of taxes to the United states of America or to\n'em or or bar association fees or student loans see or student organization fees\nThat when you have an obligation to serve all that all pay a fair share and that was the argument that actually had a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in the boot case\nAbout forty five years ago and six successive Supreme Court rulings that affirmed it\nWill be the case there Janice overturned\nExactly so but look Janice\nThat Alito Sam Alito judge of the Supreme Court has wanted this case has asked for this case for years most people thought it was idiot logically base because the issue was really on the outside that that the the case that the Mackinac center I Wish they were being more honest about it\nThat the Mackinac center that Donald Trump that others made was that you know the Democratic party used unions as their foot soldiers so let's defund unions that had really nothing to do with other kinds of things and therefore they want it to a defined us however that case it's done and what has happened since\nWhich I think worse or Scott there which I think I just want to raise which is that the Mackinac center actually violated all sorts of school board policy and all sorts of norms that was by the day after the Janice sending an email on school email to ... to virtually every single teacher in ten states if we had done that\nPeople would be flapping around rightfully what we do is we actually organize I'm outside of school and what we've tried to do is basically say to to the states just give us some time so we can introduce people to the union\nOkay let me give a chance to respond and then we'll keep moving by the way it is worth knowing that the Mackinac center did file a friend of the court brief in the uh Janice versus Ashby case but go ahead Vin let me give you a chance to respond\nWell hey thank you and you know there's groups across the country that are communicating with public employees to tell them about their rights mackinaw has there might pay my said dot com website I'm In Ohio to go back to your previous caller there's the workers choose dot org website\nAnd these efforts are needed because unions like Randy's are trying to trap public employees into paying them are trying to limit the time that they can exercise their rights under jazz um in some cases in credibly confusing time periods\nIn some cases only about a week also that um states like New York New Jersey California yet give unions the ability to essentially have captive audience meetings or make their sales pitch to a public employees while at the same time\nForbidding anybody else from talking to that our employees and this is during the work day clerk clerk or what you mean by captive audience being as what what exactly are you referring to [noise]\nUm well recent legislation passed in several states gives union the ability to do what they call a orientation sessions with a with new employees so basically think a time share presentation on steroids were the union can come and\nSay this is why you have to join put a dues check off for a more a membership form in front of them say you have to you know here's why you really should sign up\nAnd there is no one else saying well wait a minute you know you actually have the right not to so that's why you're seeing all these efforts these educational efforts around the country saying no to know your rights\nAnd by the way if there is a artificial time period to limit when you can exercise your rights I'm this is what it is and she was help navigating that\nI Want to move on from his ... to to see if we can move on and then go a little bit further forward in terms of\nWhat the future legislative landscape for this may be I Will say that I have done union covered worked in the state of California before and I never went through anything that felt like a time share presentation I think people's mileage Scott will vary depending on what that on boarding meeting is like", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "23"}
