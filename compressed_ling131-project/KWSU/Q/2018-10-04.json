country was Christine Blasey Ford's testimony in the Senate in the Judiciary Committee judge Brett Kavanaugh's response\nAnd the way that women and men have reacted to that testimony um let's just take a moment to set it up Rebecca Traister\nYou've watched these moments along with the rest of us in America or what have you seen these last couple of weeks\nWell there was partly what we saw in the hearing room itself which was Christine Blasey Ford presenting her story within a narrow very very narrow range of expressive acceptability that women do they have to fall between if they're going to be heard and taken seriously and not written off as hysterical or unhinged\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the doors do charitable foundation\nWhos clinical scientists development

emailed to say I am so tired of people equating my anger within sanity friends laugh at my posted insinuate that I've lost it and you know what I have\nI have lost my inability to be quiet in the face

progressive I'm a proud American woman who's also conservative pro life pro Cavanaugh I Am an American woman to\nNow Rebecca Traister you started to paint a picture of the history of women who've gotten angry and made their mark their anger is not always shown in the same form as somebody yelling in the face of a Senator Jeff flake on live TV but anger nonetheless and Brittany Cooper you've written a book\nAbout finding your power in rage uh tell me a little bit about that theme in how the story fits into the moment [noise]\nA shore so part of what happens is that women are told on as many of your listeners say that to be angry it to be irrational\nAnd I had a student when I was a graduate instructor confront me um and said to me that she loved to listen to me lecture\nBecause my lectures were filled with what she called the most eloquent rage ever and it was a wakeup call for me as someone who had run away from the angry black woman stereotype my whole life because I didn't want to be discredited as a black woman moving through predominantly white institutions\nAnd so my student who was a young black woman thought and be a kind of authenticity and she helped me to realize that my anger wasn't keeping me from doing my job are showing up offering quality lectures are material or material but then it was absolutely\nWomen to make which is to acknowledge that we have the right to outrage and some reject ideas said that when we're angry about legitimate injustices\nThat this in some way make the irrational or makes are clean illegitimate and when we then begin to own that anger doesn't mean that we would come destructive or harmful it means that we happened to the energy and power and we start to use that energy and power to build the kind of world we want to see\nA and more women need to give themselves permission to do that\nI've given myself permission to do that I'm at in this moment I Am on the front lines of saying women outrage have the potential if we own it and if we don't apologize for\nUs to change this very scary a trajectory of this historical moment we have a lot to be afraid about we have a lot to be angry about opposite that anger is the catalyst for being able to do something about the things we see\nNow let's move from the Senate committee hearing room\nIn the hallways around the Senate um and even the books that are esteemed authors have bring onto the tennis court and the U.S open for another moment that American shared within the last couple of weeks Serena Williams in her match against Naomi Osaka at the U. S. open here's a cut I'll bring it back there to refresh my memory\nOf anger on the court Serena Williams infamous exchange with umpire Carlos Ramos\n[noise]\nSuresh from Shawnee you shared this moment along with the rest of America us arena is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who found that anger a weaponized against her\n[noise] Ah yes I I think that what we saw in their response was everything that Brittany in Tribeca and I have been talking about it\nWas interesting because there are so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not chasing the same policing or penalties mean she\nShe was a defined that was levied against her is the highest ever for verbal abuse in the history of the u._s. open I Believe\nAnd so in that moment there were two very distinct response as if they're responding to the people that really just wanted to see her in isolation acting um [noise]\nAnd the much broader context of the power dynamics in the moment in the history in the context and the legacy of discrimination within the sport that she has faced and so I think that one thing that has been\nUnexplored in the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine in understanding women as\nLeaders or as people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict um what she was really doing was I'm asserting her right to defend herself and to have dignity in the moment not be accused the way that she was accused\nAnd with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so a generation of role models who have benefited from title nine in the lessons of title nine which we tend to think of it as\nA athletics but it is really about leadership and the ability to act together um in teams to manage conflict to make the nuance distinctions between being assertive and being aggression and be aggressive and being angry\nI think we're seeing the ... of of that now in our political life there\nWere some pushback though to Serena Williams behavior on the court and the reaction to it even from within the tennis world a Brittany Cooper\nI don't know if you saw Martina Navratilova as response to this arena Williams episode a couple of days later but she wrote an op ed after the U.S open and she said Martina speaking now said yes women are treated differently yes there are double standards\nBut Serena was wrong her encore behavior was inappropriate and I'm paraphrasing just because men raging umpires and act like babies on the court doesn't make it right and a champion Serena should not emulate it\nI'm Martina Navratilova was wrong\nOr she did this thing that women are conditioned to do which is rather than use it at the moment of solidarity she tried police arenas conduct as a lifelong tennis fan I'm I Am living but Martina Navratilova reminded me that until this moment\nMost white women in and it had not been allies of the Williams sisters when I watch tennis with my friends were African American and its fan we talked about watching these matches on you because of the micro aggressions come from white women\nWho are often knocking at the Williams sisters and having things to say\nBut let me also add that one of the things that was most\nContext to her anger not only did he accuse her of cheating but this also came out on the heels of reports that members of the USPA had been showing up to her house\nUnannounced and testing her over and over again on grounds that maybe she was doping even though she has come clean on every drug tested even those statistics show\nThat they were testing her double the amount that they were testing any other players on the women's five and so she had been subjected to repeated indignities and then as the best tennis player of her generation and perhaps ever see them has a referee\nWho accuses her cheating and she's one more grand slam than any woman other than Margaret Court and any woman in the open air and that is indicative of the kinds of fury that we're talking about the way that women are disrespected daily have their contributions and their qualifications undermined\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Americans for the yards committed to transforming America's communities through the arts

Joshua Johnson we're talking about the power of women's anger in the current moment in America\nI'm Talking with Rebecca Traister for New York magazine and the cut author of good in mad Britney Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage and also ... director of the women's media center speech project and author of the new book\nRage becomes her now I read an email from Karen at the end of the last segment that said she was hurt disappointed and angry wounded about the treatment of Hillary Clinton and the twenty sixteen campaign and I want to go there because Hillary Clinton is one prominent famous\nWoman well known for navigating the shoulders of how women are supposed to express themselves in public now Hillary Clinton\nHas a history of being\nVery careful and very deliberate mindful of appearing angry or emotional she's been at it for thirty five years in America and in fact it was the news in the two thousand and eight campaign I remember this when she shed a tear in New Hampshire one tier and it was at the top of CNN for like a new cycle and a half\nSo now a lot of people are saying that the twenty sixteen presidential campaign I'm Hillary Clinton in fact was was tone police listen\nI regret deeply [noise]\nHow angry\nTone of the campaign became [noise]\nNot your fault\nSays one audience member when when Hillary Clinton very deliberately in that in Hillary fashion says I regret how nasty the campaign became um ... just this moment has clearly struck a chord Rebecca Traister who's laughing here in the studio with me but how does that strike you [laughter] so she\nI think it was um it was\nRidiculous that this woman was called an authentic while being held to the standard\nOf care full control in her voice and her facial of parents and her body and her motive expression I mean\nThe two candidates um that were her primary opponents both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders could act in unhinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they can pound ...\nYou know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was a gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card right there were all of these conversations about\nI'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender\nUm and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign\nRecord right it's so right about this and I'm In fact the thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton\nBoth Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political press for their particular skill in channeling the anger of their supporters this with their gift\nThey were able to give voice to this frustration and we were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion and yet every time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said\nYou're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ... a a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough said smile is if it was like some cat color on the street smile more um she was told that regularly\nAnd I think that that's again an example of of not having that tool to wield she also had done remarkable writing and talking herself\nIn instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in our own\nMemoir of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that second debate where Donald Trump came up behind her and kind of loomed behind her and how menacing and aggressive his body language was and how during\nThe debate a presidential debate she was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but that she was thinking no no no that's gonna redound negatively to me that's gonna make me look bad\nHow much energy women extend\nModulating considering strategizing thinking tactically about how to use their voice how to suppress their voice how to channel their anger how to swallow their anger what to do in order to be rhetorically\nEffective and and I think that that's something that that all three of us who are writing about and thinking about is the amount of time and energy women spend doing this kind of maneuvering around the rules around are angry expressions\nI Want to I Want to talk a little bit in the last ... section of the show that we have about where some of this anger\nGoes because this is a moment in America and let's be realistic moments have a way of fading they just do and and so I'm interested in where this goes when\nMaybe the cameras and all of the writers who aren't Rebecca Traister and Britney Cooper are not as interested anymore you know in in a couple of years I think that might happen and I want to know where this goes now we've been hearing from so many wanting listeners I Want to play you another mash up of some of the women's voices who've been reaching out to us about how they're feeling my\nName's Aaron I'm calling from Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is Sarah from Cincinnati when I let my anger bubble over and I get really angry out loud it\nIt really doesn't do much good I find that if I express a strong opinion or even just a bit of discomfort with something I'm perceived as being angrier overreacting women yelling even in this day and age that are acceptable then don't seem to have that same problem and I'm\nStarting to feel like maybe it's not just a personal issue I'm dealing with what's going to be nice and and uh and keep my mouth shut however I Am so angry and so angry right now maybe women all over the place you're dealing with it\nI'm trying my anger into action\nDoesn't help but feel like I'm not alone but\nStill pretty discouraging I think that's the one that has to do we have to take that anger hold onto it\nAnd that's how we're going to take back this country\nWe're hearing from when he listeners women who it feels like there's a theme or transferring\nSome of their personal rage I'm sure a lot of it's in in personal life not just political life or cultural life but into action taking action industries taking action maybe at the ballot box we got this tweet from Tracy in Jacksonville I'm One of the thousands of women using their frustration to run for office\nI'm running for the Florida House district Fifteen I Am focused on\nMy determination to be a voice for all and focus on issues important to Jacksonville families Tracey as one candidate who says that this moment of anger is very important for her motivation a Brittany Cooper I Want it\nThe fact um none of us knows exactly how that vote is going to turn out but it seems like any\nPoster or political analyst worth anything is looking down and what they called a cross tabs and noticing that women are mad women are going to vote and women are going to form a title even twenty Eighteen one way or the other\nSlowly and that is as it should be um I'm particularly heartened by ah the Stacey Abrams campaign down in Georgia we have the opportunity to have\nThe first black woman I'm governor of a state of a former slave state um the ... campaign they're all of these progressive campaigns that are being run and here's the thing we've been seeing that since twenty sixteen we had a wave of a progressive as sort of radically progressive black mayors in the deep south\nUp and so one of the things that I Want to challenge folks to do as we think in this moment is to actually look at what people of color are doing not just women but we're particularly black women in these elections the ways that we have the channeling our\nAnger on for decades and decades and that started with the way that we voted for Hillary Clinton in this most immediate political moment um but to your earlier point about whether or not\nOur anger can be sustained um I think that I think that this can be sustained I think that we have to remember that the women's movement in this country do it goes through ebbs and flows has really been a solid political project uh since uh depending on how you count eight seed thirty one or Eighteen forty eight\nSo we're we're two hundred years in a almost here and so I think you know\nI'm I think that there is a real opportunity for us to make some change here and I think the as women see that\nUm our power in our ability to frame issues in ways that includes the most American and take care of the most marginalized American um I I'm I'm excited about a blue wave of what I what I Hope though is that folks start to see that even if you don't care a lot about presidential politics\nUm ... down ballot races really matter that local races
