a strong political base to Anthony Scaramucci President Trump's former communications director\nIt's pretty obvious it was just ... brief rather dramatic tenure in the White House it blew up after ... foul mouth tirade aimed at former chief strategist Steve Bannon and former chief of staff Reince Priebus\nHis new book explains what he learned during his time in the White House his relationship to the president and his policies for the working class joining us now from NPR in New York is Anthony Scaramucci his new book is called Trump the blue collar president Anthony welcome to winning thanks so much rather looks\nBlue collar considering everything in his house is gilded but I don't think that's quite what you mean by that\nYeah well listen I mean I tried to pick a controversial title I knew that the um the people on the on the left side of the political ledger would be upset with that title because Mr Trump has a gilded toilet and um\nThe apartment looks like Louis the fourteen smoke crystal meth and then decorated department so I knew that would upset them by some footage ... yes yeah but I but I but I I titled it that way because I grew up in a blue collar neighborhood I have blue collar parents that never went to college and\nMy dad had an hourly workers job when he got started in his career and and the people that I grew up with a really light come and they support him even to this day and so I think there's a message in the book as to why they do that\nI'm In and listen you know why I Try to open my mind up to everybody's fought and everybody's ideas on not closed minded I understand the president has many flaws and I understand the people\nOn the side of the aisle that don't like him I understand why but I think the book has an important voice because the people on the other side of the aisle and don't like him I Would suggest that they read the book\nSo that they could get some sense for\nWhy he's at forty seven percent and climbing and why he's tightened up a um [noise] what could have been a blue wave he's tightened up that race and made it a closer are and why he's getting countless thousands of people to show up at his rallies I think what's important for people to lose to understand it well I I Will have to agree with that just hopefully they can understand well and I\nThink I understand where you're where you're coming from with that point it kind of\nIt makes me think about I don't remember I don't know if you've ever seen Citizen Kane\nBut if you think about the character of Charles foster Kane when he starts to go into politics part of what gives him a serious chance of winning and of course he he fails because of another scandal but it's this idea that he starts to articulate for people who feel like they're not\nBeing heard you can argue with his politics but just to the ability to speak to people and have them go yeah what he said that's what we've been trying to get you to hear I that's kind of what I'm hearing from your argument that Donald Trump was able to articulate something that millions of Americans have tried to I Want you to feel validated on for a long time\nYet nope no question I think I think that there is Liz ... working class middle class people lower middle class people have against the Washington establishment I think there was a series of complaints where they feel that they've been under served and they see\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the Alfred P Sloan Foundation bridging science technology in the arts by supporting exhibitions such as

House in his new book Trump the blue collar president acknowledge that there are quite a few of the audience who are questioning our shall we say\nEditorial choice to bring Mr Scaramucci on NPR duly noted you can spend the time to complain about the guest that we pick which is you're right\nOr you can spend the time to send to say well thought out incisive question for the man who has some insights into Donald Trump why he won and why he feels that it might be a playbook that even his political opponents might want to pay attention to\nShould you choose that routes you're more than welcome to comment on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U.\nDot org Anthony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about and then what kind of turned you around from that\nAnd I've had a a quaint and ship with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he is threatened to run and out in times past than I always thought it was like a great publicity edge you say to threaten to run it threatened to run yeah LA's higher than run for president are are going to support Romney because you know I decided not the right time for me to run for president\nSo there's something a little short of about the words threatened not he floated the idea or he hinted at a rally threatens\nYeah that sort of go back and look at some of the cage when he was running in two thousand for the reform party it was a threatening to run that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know if you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president but sort of like that sort of a threat but ah\nYou know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution them on something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person\nHas a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature of the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of this story and then it makes it harder for you or a bottle you know so for me um I Love coming on NPR all go on left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning journalists interviews because I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said\nThat he spent a lot of time understanding the other side ideas that he felt that we are very smart people on the other side and that always understanding\nMy argument that I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm not looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going a lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing from them\nWell and there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press and the communications director where you tried\nTo convince the president said to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you said that\nIt pushed back is normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive\nI hear you on that but the president didn't seem to be happening he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for hand full that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda yeah no\nNo no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know like if you if you if you read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in there\nWas to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so\nHaving the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power you know that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department and Mike ... plan is a online somewhere somebody we did so it it's out there was a ... page plan that basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press\nAnd servicing all parts of the press so it didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything I only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call on CNN had been called on for several weeks and I want to send a message to those people that have we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room or open for business\nAnd you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I build my own business and you know came from scratch wind in the square ought to I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it well I think we're headed up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanna previous and ban and out of there I made it very big gaffe when he put Kelly and the job\nIt was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president and even if I accepted a subordinate role\nFace it I'm a New Yorker I have a New Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality or does that strike you as somebody like General Kelly with like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying ever torque\nWell having you know your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points for him to even be on the on the list but it was going to like me any more than he likes the price of your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press\nHe could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean I get the sense that the president just\nDidn't agree with it [noise] um no\nActually you know such damage where there's a funny story you know 'cause you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on I'm sitting in the oval office with um the penny and meeting where I'd been announces ... director is over it's him and I alone in the office\nI'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press corps he looks at me and says hey it's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's gone so poorly in the first six months\nI listen to what you declared war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media for ... going to lose that war secondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well you way better served if we dial that down\nOr any other thing is the president a TV star a people may not like me saying that about him but for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism\nLet him parity with Leslie stall let him have a real conversation with a crust Cuomo or somebody like that I mean he doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had him in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also a lot of people don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in a way of a really good story or we know that about the president so there was a lot of people inside the calm seems like okay\nWe got to protect the president from him telling these like ... and him telling these\nStories that are on average ... may be a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is that oh okay that's right 'cause I'm On saying inaccurately and and clearly in consistently over listen I just left they show where these guys like they they really want them all day and night and ...\nDoing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energized and I understand that\nAnd I understand if you're a military leader like someone who John Kelly that would probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want all that stuff to be dial down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to\nSo so but but we had to do that as you got to tell them straight if a man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but well he'll say back to you as well as energizing my base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote\nAnd and this is always going to be a battle as long as Donald J Trump is the president United States is going to be a battle between\nPolicy and personality and the people that like his policy are going to take his personality and then we also don't like his policies are going to really focus on his personality and by the way there are some people were the personality is actually outweighing the policy where they're like okay look I Can't take the personality even though the policies are good thing\nDavid is in a diner Minnesota David emailed thanks for taking the time to answer questions on NPR my question is\nHave you ever in your personal experiences with Trump seen him do something for the public good out of ethical or moral reasons instead of doing it because of legal reasons are wanting to maintain an image or exchange favors if you can can we hear about it\nYou know it's I don't really I haven't really seen any of that so I I don't I don't like being one of those guys that tries to make stuff up and comment on that stuff that I haven't really seen for to go back to your other ... percent of my wife is a staunch liberal she's outside the glass box here and I'm looking at her she's making his mark on her face
