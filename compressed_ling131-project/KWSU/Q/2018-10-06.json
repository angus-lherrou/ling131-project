glad to have you back good to be a gesture America and other western governments hammered Russia's spy network this week\nYesterday the U.S indicted seven military spies with links to an Olympic doping scandal earlier is the Dutch authorities said they had foiled a cyberattack against the international chemical weapons watchdog let's explain\nFor men working for Russian military intelligence or caught trying to hack the computer network at the headquarters of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons OPEC W.\nThat's the group that was investigating the use of chemical weapons in Salzburg England that attack on the floor Russian spy\nReports suggest the set was working when Dutch security officers\nThe attack David Sanger let me start with you what what's going on here\nWell what's going on here is that we're beginning to see that the DNC hack\nAnd everything that we've been obsessed with rightly so since the twenty sixteen election was to the Russians just a small slice of how they have used cyber as the main way that they seek to disrupt and undermine not only foreign governments\nBut those who would be opponents of Vladimir Putin's or those who are busy investigating other Russian malfeasance so when you go across the indictment and the other day there that we got from the British and from the Dutch\nUh yesterday and and the day before\nWhat it adds up to as as soon as you begin an investigation into Russian malfeasance\nYou should expect Packers from what was formerly known as the G argue the military intelligence unit of the Russian military to be at your doorstep or in the case of the chemical weapons or agency to be in the Marriott Hotel parking lot across the way\nAnd what they're doing is seeking to get into computer systems disrupt steel e mails under cut the legitimacy of the organization sound familiar exactly what they've been doing in Ukraine what they've done in European elections and what they did here and twenty sixteen\nGreat so we have a sense of why they would want to go after these specific organizations like the the anti Doping Agency I mean Russia did get pinched for doping in recent Olympic Games but

roundup with NPR's Greg Myre ... of the wall Street Journal and David Sanger of the New York times with regards to cyber hacking Michael asks\nWith the loss and result in widespread dissemination of the CIA tool kit which allows one to spoof hacking from another country how can cyber bread crumbs lead to certainty that in other countries actually guilty David what do you think well\nCyber attribution is something that people are getting a lot better at I'm certainly there are lots of ways to make it appear that a cyber attack came from other places when the New York times was attacked by the Chinese and its computer systems ah years ago it looked like the attack was coming from a University in the southern\nA motive\nPast use so similar tools can get you most of the way most of the time so there are some pretty good ways to go do it\nThe bigger question facing many governments is once they found this out and perhaps decide one ounce it as happened in these most recent cases than the political pressures on them so what do you do about it\nThat's why the president signed a new set of executive orders and I'm\nIn August we haven't seen them they're all classified that pushes down into the system\nOr the ability for commanders in the U.S to do cyber attacks back without having presidential sign off till now that's been something that the only only the president could authorized the use of nuclear weapons and cyber weapons now\nIt's not entirely clear that only he can authorize the use of cyber weapons in retaliation but you want to make sure you're attribution is pretty good before you strike back\nYou know who to attack yeah great married before we move on from this first of all that is no small thing that that the U.S military might have the latitude unilaterally to shut down a power grid or turn off or you know hydroelectric dam through the Internet\nBut beyond that do we have a sense that certain countries certain organizations are getting a better handle on dealing with cyberattacks to world clearly hasn't figured this out\nIs anyone making progress I think about the EU because I hear so much about Internet regulations from there on a consumer level but on a military level is anyone making progress\nOr not that I'm aware of the U.S I think it's still the world leader in in in terms of you know advanced Internet abilities and and the threats are pretty clear or Russia or China and North Korea or Iran\nBut a ... figuring out or response in how you want to calibrate that response so it doesn't become this open ended escalation and you don't know the capabilities of your rivals if you respond a ... you're entering really uncharted\nTerritory Vivian do we get a sense of countries beginning to kind of work together to figure this out to to figure out some kind of international response to cyber attacks or his Russia really got the whole world kind of running with here\nThan what we've seen in the last couple of days of coordination as hum indictments than you know raising concerns about I'm signing an otherwise obviously there's a lot of discussion that are taking place where countries our western allies trying to coordinate\nMany uh restrictions and so many um uncertainty as to how to approach the cyber world in general on cyber threats\nAnd as David said the U.S trying to really formulate some sort of attack plan or something to counter and to protect our infrastructure so that we don't have um we're not as vulnerable as we've seen ourselves\nIn the past but obviously you know the U. S. is still trying to figure out a way forward I'm having looked at what happened to us and the two thousand and sixteen election still we're talking about the fact that we are vulnerable in two thousand Eighteen we could be vulnerable on twenty twenty so we haven't actually tried quite figured out how to protect ourselves cat alone\nThe world's kind of coordinating on a global scale to do the same it's it's it's not an easy task\nFollowed funny kind of a decentralization of the way that we felt that we are so many different kinds of voting systems might in a way kind of how it helps allied health insulated from according to the fact that we got all these different utility company yeah but you know ... but but the key element here is we've done a better job at\nDiscussing internally how we would do counterattacks than we have organizing the world than the sort of digital Geneva Convention what standards of what's on limits and often it\nLet's shift gears and talk about the Nobel Prize is particularly the Nobel Peace prize the winners were announced this morning Dr Denis ... and ... one\nFor their work combating sexual violence as a weapon of war the announcement from the Nobel Committee said in part quote Dennis ... is to help or who has devoted his life to defending these victims not him a rod is the witness who tells of the abuses perpetrated against herself\nAnd others were rod is an Iraqi woman she was captured and held by the Islamic state skates captivity after three months and told to her story in a book called the last girl\nDr ... founded a hospital in eastern Congo that treated thousands of women many of whom are survivors of gang rape ... pretty extraordinary people to be winning this prize especially as we've learned more about how sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war and has for quite some time\nYeah really has to two individuals who seem really deserving the peace prize has been a lot of had a lot of controversy in recent years very politicized\nA couple of people who really been thrust into dangerous situations handles it with with incredible courage and and Dr ... up built this hospital in eastern Congo which is in the middle of ...\nThat was his intent but as the Congolese civil war metastasize um rape became a huge issue a huge problem the various factions un peacekeepers were involved in in rape there and so he became the voice\nOf rape being used as a weapon of war and so he's been asked this for Twenty years very prominent a voice but still operating in a very a\nA dicey region of very deserving winter I mean\nI I can really speak for the case of um ... who I I spend a lot of time in Iraq and two dozen Fifteen sixteen I'm interviewing gets easy women who were released from captivity from ISIS and\nThe impact to the obviously psychologically physically or the the the use of sexual assault\nAnd rape as a tool in a war is obviously a huge thing but you have to also remember that these women go back to their tried to go back home a lot of their family shunned them because of cultural sensitivities to such things and so\nTheir lives are essentially up ended by their families a lot of times don't take them back home a lot of these women were impregnated I'm as a result of this and had to really know where to go because\nThey were single mothers which in Iraq is is just\nCompletely a taboo and so uh you know it's something that huge raising awareness for that is that something really really important and you had a lot of people on the ground in Iraq [noise]\nTrying to educate these families that this is not of no false to the women that they had no say in the matter but obviously you know changing cultural perceptions it's it's as enough help out on so this woman obviously I'm trying to do that and it's a it's it's worth the setting of notoriety that she's dating\nLet's shift gears and talk about China vice president Mike Pence spoke yesterday accusing China of trying to sway American public opinion and undermined the Trump Administration\nTo put it bluntly President Trump's leadership is working in China wants a different American president there can be no doubt China is meddling in America's democracy\nDavid what is vice president Pence mean by meddling what do we know about what China actually is doing well it's it's pretty fascinating because he is appropriating\nThe language of the Russian attacks from on the twenty sixteen election and transferring it over with different set of activities that\nThe Chinese are are involved in that there's no question that the Chinese have views cyber before in for political purposes but they largely haven't used it here they've used it in Taiwan\nThey've used it to some degree in Australia and New Zealand\nBut what he is arguing is that in putting together retaliatory tariffs terrorists that are retaliating for terrorists the United states put on China\nThey are aiming at states and districts that are key to President Trump\nAnd therefore causing pain\nTo workers there and they're saying that that accounts meddling well if that's the case we've done the same thing and foreign countries where we when we imposed tariffs frequently do it with a political goal in mind you're trying to change the political behavior of the country\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the

nuclear deal that was negotiated during President Obama's tenure and reimposed sanctions Iran took us to court the international court of justice to argue that the u._s. actions violated the terms of the Nineteen fifty five treaty of amity\nWell the Trump Administration hit back this week secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday that the U.S is ending that treaty\nThis is a decision frankly that his thirty nine years overdue [noise]\nEnjoy around brought in Marilyn's case and the international court of justice alleging violations of the treaty of amity Iran seeks to challenge the United states' decision to seize participation in the Iran nuclear deal and to reimpose the sanctions were lifted as part of that deal\nAre always attempted interfere with the sovereign rights of the United states to take a waffle actions necessary to protect our national security and Iran and to using the icy Jay for political and propaganda purposes\nThat was secretary of state Mike Pompeo speaking on Wednesday Vivian salami some have said that ending this treaty\nI say I think um in general it's more just reinforcing the administration says standing efforts to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and\nUm crackdown on Iran and kind of show that they're not messing around and so I'm basically this was just one more step in that process but as far as any real uh changes on the ground it really doesn't do much it's really just our sponsor\nTo on the international court of justice says ruling that uh that essentially said that sanctions that we they re imposing sanctions um for not fair to Iran\nBring my step back for just a second what is this treaty of ... [noise] uh I'm sure that was the question of the state department I just had this vision of some low level staff are going through the basement looking treaty or really am a nature really damaged\nI answered it I think through what we've heard about it is that the big acronym to Jaycee peel away the Iran nuclear deal but what\nIs this treaty of Amman well in Nineteen fifty three the U.S helped orchestrate a coup in Iran bringing the shah of Iran back to power\nThey were you asked in Iran where buddy buddy at that time and so two years later\nIt's yeah you brought me back to power sure treaty of amnesty great and they were indeed good friends from fifty three until the Seventy nine revolution oh this is the shah who was deposed in the Islamic world in the Islamic Revolution of Seventy nine so for thirty nine years uh there has been no enmity between us in a rod\nUm this again seems very symbolic I'm just a last little relic that somehow didn't get shredded after the the the revolution in Seventy nine\nIt was the last hurrah of Kermit Roosevelt grandson of funeral Roosevelt CIA operatives who almost singlehandedly staged this coup and then they got everybody we put in power to go sign the treaty port Kermit he's getting no respect in the state department these days\nI made a layman's Kermit Roosevelt of digging it I I liked that name for for a man who had such a place in history Kermit Roosevelt and nowhere is the American David ... is there any real effect in terms of\nThe sanctions the consequences to the U. S. for refusing to lift them if this treaty of Emmett see is more symbolic where might there be more tangible impact\nSo the tangible impact is November when President Trump has said that he will impose the full sanctions on Iran He's given allies\nSay any ... company around the world but particularly European companies\nIf you do business with Iran you're not doing business with the United states and it's an effort to choke off the Iranians\nBy making the big aircraft makers Boeing's already pulled out the big oil a production equipment makers all get out of Iran and they were doing that what's happening now though is that the ... the Europeans are saying we're going to find a mess it\nTo buy oil from Iran without clearing it in dollars so that the u._s. can affect it with the sanctions\nAnd a number of us went up and met a with the Iranian foreign minister when he was at the un ah last week and he made an argument to us was Saturday evening that he believed that this method was going to come together so we're heading toward a conflict between the U.S and its European allies\nOver on do we have a sense I think I feel like the the big issue really is Iran's nuclear program and the argument from the other nations who are still signatories to this this deal the Iran nuclear deal\nIs that it's it's not perfect but it's good and that it has done something to impede Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon do we have a sense of where we stand in that regard sending the economic stuff aside for a moment does this put us any closer on that path\nOr we still kind of in a holding pattern I mean what is what's that look like\nThe Europeans as you say they they consistently say that they they don't want to North Korea is I mean this is of course before we became buddy buddy and\nPresident Trump declared that he and Kim Jong un or I Love\nUh we we didn't want to North Korea and the sense that we didn't want these two very active or potentially rope nuclear states and so I'm a checked Iran was always going to be better than an unchecked Iran and so that was the Europeans argument as to why\nThe nuclear deal had to continue despite its imperfections and so um\nThe issue is is that um as far as violations to the actual denuclearization goes", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "06"}
