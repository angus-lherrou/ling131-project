Washington Post good to have you back saying Hi from afar Joshua\nLet's begin with the weather which may be\nFlorida's panhandle bore the brunt of the damage that's where it made landfall many beachfront homes are in peace and some of them in splinters at best\nAnd the number of water rescues are under way more than a million power customers in Florida Georgia the Carolinas and Virginia are disconnected and the death toll has risen to at least Thirteen people\nThe administrator of FEMA Brock Long spoke to CNN's John Berman on new day\nWhat's the biggest challenge you and your teams are facing this morning for\nAccess you know access to all the areas is one thing a search and rescue is where we are hyper focus this morning but at that uh you know simultaneously what we're trying to do is assessed roadways and bridges to make sure that we can get you know teams commodities and equipment and to the areas that were hardest hit\nA hospital system or near Panama City in and around Panama City took a hit too so we have to stabilize the Cape and health and medical capabilities that are there\nAre over thirty thousand workers from around the United states have been pre stage to try to work as quickly as possible to get the power back on but here again it's all about access we gotta get make sure that it's safe to travel down roadway corridors and get in there to uh start rebuilding the power grid which could take a very long time at this point\nIt's FEMA administrator Brock Long speaking on CNN he also expressed some frustration with Floridians who did not mind the updates to the building codes which were updated in two thousand one pretty clear to see which homes were up to code and which were not you can tell which homes were up to code because they were still standing when Michael is gone\nCuts we'll talk about the kind of pressure that FEMA is under with this recovery effort especially considering that these kinds of strong storms may well become more frequent in the near future not a\nStorm huge sections you saw some of the drone coverage or an aerial photos entire sections of Mexico beach in Florida\nEssentially a racist or a devastating storm even if the death toll was not the horrible numbers that we heard from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico belated numbers by the way so you asked about the government and their response of FEMA has of course fallen under increased scrutiny since Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and quite appropriately so\nMany of the shortfalls from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico don't seem to have fallen squarely on the shoulders and indeed the federal government in this case I think managed to skirt a lot of the responsibility for\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Americans for the arts

sixteenth on PBS\nIt's the friday news roundup with political journalist Todd's will lick reporter Shane Harris of the Washington Post and lose your Molly of kick you read these California report before we move on from the weather and the climate Louis there was one more thing you want to jump\nYeah I I just wanted to not to mention you know ... Rome or the other guy who won the Nobel Prize in economics this week talking about carbon taxes being the solution to to this crisis at least in part\nOn and you know I think it's important to just recognize that sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there\nAnd that is if you commit to attacks uh on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue head on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people to make money investors to to make money off of it because when money at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate\nAn economic argument is often on carbon tax or that it's bad for business California's the fifth largest economy in the world and Jerry Brown just signed an executive order committing the state to carbon neutrality\nBy twenty forty five which I'm sure it sounds crazy to people outside of the state but that's actually very close to one of the policy prescriptions the I. T. I. P. C. C. set forth\nIt's kind of crazy until you do it really in trouble for a very serious about doing it\nIt's a very serious about doing it um you know Paul Romer talks about\nThe problem isn't going to be solved until you build consensus 'em and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political will not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada same thing there you have prime minister Justin Trudeau trying to in a\nAnd posted a carbon tax across the country and he's running into a real opposition at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment more comments on this not my account of me tweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change\nA good point I wanted to kind of me I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not question the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying [noise]\nLeary tweeted it's frustrating to hear criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people's vacation but they're mostly stuck this storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand I disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you ...\nOf a rising coastline if you want to live there you just have to absorb that on the other hand I totally hear what he's coming from Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall had to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake the talented and incorporate it it's it's a tough one\nNow it is really tough and when we're when we're thinking about climate change in the sort of thirty to forty year arc Todd and I were just talking about the strength to break 'em their existential risks that are POWs not just to\nA community is close to the coastline to where we are talking about today but large cities like Miami in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about\nSurvive ability about resilience or whether people want to continue living there and there is an element of risk that you take for that also has to give people some agency and what I think is missing from the conversation about climate change\nIs a real honest discussion about long term risk and what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... ... one small point just the end if you think that risking getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about\nUh Americans also need to think about what some of our international leaders leaders generals like Colin Powell advisers had been saying for years that you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they started to migrate when they upset the relationships between countries and that becomes not just their problem in terms of life and death but America's problem in terms of of keeping the world in order\nWill listen for those of you who are in an had been in the path of hurricane Michael we wish you of course a speedy recovery and we'd love to hear from you\nAs you continue to deal with the recovery give us a sense of how you're doing how the recovery is going what your thoughts are and how things are going how well FEMA is meeting your needs\nState officials how well that's going we always love to hear from you feel free to email us one a at W.

administration Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations announced her resignation on Tuesday\nA lot of what kind of want to bring in I Want to make sure I have\nA black thing going on her every day and just hang in there and how only down from fighting for our country our\nNikki Haley speaking on Tuesday about resigning as US ambassador to the un this resignation was different\nFrom some of the others we've seen in this administration because it seemed to kind of come out of nowhere by surprise last month ambassador Haley published an op ed in the Washington Post declaring her loyalty to and respect for the president Shane what is your read on Nikki Haley's resignation\nAnnouncement to do we take it at face value is there more at play here what do you think well there's\nYeah there's always more play particularly in this White House um it was a surprise there is no doubt about that it was a surprise even to people in the administration uh Nikki Haley [noise] also I think had found herself increasingly politically isolated in the power centers of foreign policy\nAnd the administration with John Bolton the national security advisor and Mike Pompeo now secretary of state a sort of absorbing a lot of that energy and then of course this administration being quite hostile to the United nations being UN ambassador is not necessarily the most powerful position\nUm Nikki Haley has presidential ambitions I she she said today ... meeting with Trump this week she's not running and twenty twenty she plans to be campaigning for him a twenty twenty four is not that long away a\nAnd so I think there's an element of that as well the question of why now is a curious one that'll keep people in Washington guessing she may have thought get out before the midterms I'm there may be a Democrat certainly of Democrats take back the house they're going to become a subpoena factory this administration will be under investigation\nRelentlessly and Nikki Haley herself is under scrutiny for a private jet flights that she accepted from friends and associates there's been some investigation to that um it might have just a band that now is the time to head for the exits and and I have to say she really does leave\nI'm probably one of the best positions of any senior trumpet ... official she's not leaving under a lot of scandal uh she won generally plaudits for her work at the un she was seen as a stabilizing force within an administration that meant\nAs as smart and capable and as ambitious is Nikki Haley this is not her swan song really that was exactly what was going to ask you about it's just kind of\nWhat you read into Nikki Haley's resignation compared to some of the other turnover\nIn the Trump Administration I mean it's not on precedent and former U.S ambassador to the UN to search for a year some serve for three or four years so I'm sort of for one year or so\nThe sheer duration of her term isn't necessarily telling but uh I I don't know that we view this in the same light as stay the way that like Rex Tillerson left some of the other people in misery\nAbsolutely that's a great point I mean frankly two years seems like a natural timeline or for for somebody to serve in such a position and decides\nTo call it quits and um and Trevor Noah jokes have at least this this resignation was scandal free I'm so there's that you know it's been interesting watching a chorus of er\nOf Democrats I'm a democratic lawmakers praising her a and then the last few days I'm staying in some cases that\nThey didn't have very high expectations of her going in and they sort of that we thought that\nAh now that she's been there for for two years and um and has that down what they deem is a pretty good job\nHaving said that the ACLU has been very critical of her tenure in this role and they say that she's undermined universal human rights and international bodies\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the Joyce Foundation

org\nAnd from the listeners who support this NPR station\nBack now to the friday news roundup with little each a Molly Shane Harris and Todd's will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing his Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump is using the issue to energize Republicans\nDemocrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see\nThis going especially since Democrats some of them\nSeem determined not to let the Kavanaugh's confirmation go it seems to have had\nThe opposite effect certainly so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put the provides though around what I'm about to say\nAh that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming mid terms we will know in four weeks however it looks like now it's having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like Tennessee or places like north\nState actually had a chance of either surviving or in the case of Tennessee or maybe picking up an open seat\nTo now a surge for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon teams to in Senate races have solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously in house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that has had the opposite effect because I'm not sure the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nIn a lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college uh I Would look to the house\nMost likely house members who may\nIf the numbers hold true control the house after January the will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships in like ... and like a shame said before they will become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base that wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this\nJoshua comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of that FBI background\nCheck that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile highly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee or the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior to peers that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up that charge slowly\nAdd to this you know senator Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary can they even she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the cancer can grill\nAt the director Christopher Wray on their face to face on how much intervention did the White House do in this supplemental background check will click also ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in is\nAnd state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that letter friend Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months and last thing I'll say it she just last night with trying to take the fight from you know on the SCOTUS thing too\nThat the way that they're trying to remake the courts rent large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California ... this is a court that's been a real ... side the White House just put forth three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on that and she's very upset about that and Trump\nAt ... really breaking friend tradition by not giving the home state senators any say in these tax\nI Do want to see if we can leave time to talk California politics before the round up is up but a few more things out of D.C we wanted to discuss including the president stepping into the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and Kanye West he publicly just missed swift\nFor endorsing two Democrats in Tennessee and he woke up Kanye West of the White House yesterday Connie wore red make America great again hat for the visit\nAnd we have less to do all of these I don't want to say I don't want to put you in this by by love this guy who let me just as\nNow calling us was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like Saturday Night live make the president look bad he said the president needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear those Shane Harris Conyers seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he noted\nThat he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of easy to criticize but the fact that he said\nThat he is bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity is at the other side of the regular desk I I'm not sure what to do with it\nI I'm not either I mean I could see was quite surreal we were actually on the news room working on other ... are more important stories I hesitate to to the deep end this like you and looked up at the TV and we all sort of set is this is this really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it but it is part of a litany of these kind of\nOffice and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of\nA a when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not that surprising but I think for a lot of people there's a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president to see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make it a behavior\nFrom a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that's his right but there's also left many people scratching has had about what is he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him a it was just a very strange moment and I know for\nFor for for me and my heart just tried to move past it as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest of moving past as quickly as we could do that too but I should know the ... old nemesis Taylor Swift inserted herself into politics this week\nShe endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media the Senate race in Tennessee is tight and British has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram and voter registrations among young people rose by more than ... sixty thousand\nAfter her post\nShane Harris let me stick with you for a moment because President Trump is facing another difficult situation regarding the disappearance of a journalist named ... Saudi dissident and a resident of the U.S he disappeared inside the Saudi consulate\nIn Turkey you've been doing a fair bit of reporting on this particularly the concern that the Turks have raised that the Saudis basically said hit men to kill ... to show you because of his reporting\nThe Turkish government hasn't really provided any independent evidence for this they say they have security video and and logs and people who signed in and so forth what do we actually know right now if anything about what really happened right well we know right\nNow is largely coming from the Turks and Turkish security agencies\nAre what we reported last time my colleagues and I and the Post's late last night was at the Turks have told the Americans that they actually have audio recordings and video from inside the consulate that they say definitively prove ... who was an opinion writer for the post Washington Post\nA was a beaten and tortured and killed and ultimately dismembered inside\nThat facility um the Americans and we understand have not seen the footage or heard it themselves but there's a growing belief within the U.S intelligence community and I think with him\nIt all being forthcoming about that this is a politically difficult situation for this president in particular because the White House is so close to uh the the regime and Saudi Arabia I'm Jared Kushner the president's son in law and senior advisors actually very personally close to a man named Mohammed bin so I'm On the crown prince\nOf Saudi Arabia and I broke a story earlier this week that before ... he went missing been so mine had actually ordered an operation to try and lure him back\nA ... perhaps under false pretenses to Saudi Arabia where he could be detained show he's been very critical of Hamas and so on so this looks to be like potentially a a kidnapping gone wrong in the sun bowl it's not clear whether Mohammed been someone ordered this killing he seems clearly to have tried to order a way to get cash showed you back", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "13"}
