midterms four states have ballot initiatives that would change how they draw voting districts instead of lawmakers drawing their own lines independent redistricting commissions would take over\nTwenty one states already have these commissions supporters say independent commissions helped make districts more competitive critics say it's too much power to give an elected officials\nJoining us to discuss it is read Wilson national correspondent for the hill read welcome back to want to say hey Joshua also with us is David daily a senior fellow at fair vote a nonprofit focused on electoral reform\nDavid is also the author of an upcoming book about redistricting called the rising David welcome thanks for having me back and joining us from WG VU public radio in Grand Rapids Michigan is Katie ...\nShe's the founder and executive director of voters not politicians which is based in Grand Rapids Katie thanks for joining us glad to be a Katie you're on the ground in Michigan working on redistricting reform\nI Want to hear what you're up to in just a moment but first I Want to get a little more explanation of this larger issue and ... and let me start with you\nIf you were just explain what we mean when we talk about redistricting and and what point redistricting becomes gerrymandering right so this is a process that the United states go through every ten years after the descending it'll senses\nOf the census really starts the whole process\nOr the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives the states the official number of\nUh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get there's a really complicated math formula called the Huntington hill method\nWhich I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years\nBut that that's how so every state's all fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know they're four hundred and thirty five so that is eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington hill methods so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well but then it does the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth ah and that's how we figure out that um say you know Washington state\nUh the population shift and the relative populations of each state\nSo this happens every ten years and then every ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines and now that clause has been interpreted in different ways\nOf some legislatures have challenged uh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power ... other states other legislators have more willingly given up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various courts here and there\nAre and uh the legislatures will then draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty or the the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and then the states have about a year to draw district lines\nEverybody knows pretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there and when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that that sort of the pejorative term for when a party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate a in a crazy ways in ways that\nWhere the the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power um and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through its own\nHiccups with political gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we're going to see thrown around a lot of in this next redistricting second\nYear in North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David your in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leading we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David of what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing these district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform\nIt I think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing states as a Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin\nYou might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sundays similar number of members of Congress of both parties to Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrats to Washington\nThat Democrats have only been successful and flipping one seat red to blue in any of that\nSeventeen so when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen into thousands sixteen elections there was no swing in any district in any of these competitive swings did you alter the this is as well at the state legislative level so you have all of these states\nThat are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which at ... Democrats may often when more votes state wide for a chamber and yet here for example Republicans have a super majority\nIn both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override the actions of a democratic governor here at mix politics more extreme it in the late ... members\nFrom voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom build it wildly unpopular and yet the politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead\nAnd enact that kind of legislation um and it also discourages competition in a lot of the states in North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine percent\nOf all statewide seats went without a major party competitor so voters had no choice and almost half of their district here because folks\nTook a look at those races and said I Can't win or raise enough money to actually make it worth the investment of time\nTo get to some of your comments as well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of your fans of the show no one of our audience as hot as POTUS topics including with Michael who wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power there shouldn't be partisan\nMichael writes Ohio is heavily gerrymandered however in an election earlier this year voters heavily approved with support from both parties and the issue on the ballots are fairly redrawn districts after twenty twenty\nAnd Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered they rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an active for this twenty Eighteen election ain't that a load of crap\nThat's all the same in North Carolina law by the way we did a program a while back\nIn February ... actually about gerrymandering where we put a quiz online we have some gerrymandered districts and we wanted to see if you could tell the difference between the map of gerrymandered district\nG. E. R. R. Y. M. A. R. and B. E. R. I. N. G. it was a program that aired this February you'll find that on our website the one a dot fork\nKatie let me come to you talk about voters not politicians I understand that this was a redistricting initiative that got started after you were trying to find some way to be politically active but not overtly hyper partisan and this is something that galvanized people around you right\nYeah um I accidentally started a political movement with a Facebook post it was after that when he's sixteen election uh before\nI'm headed to a Thanksgiving dinner and I had heard my friends and family is really a being drawn to both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders I'm with these messages about draining the swamp and the political resolution and\nI realized that you know there's a lot of frustration against the current system in place which makes a lot of sense I remember learning about gerrymandering and it does make it to that our voices aren't hurt or that popular\nA proposal aren't being passed that the local level and we're lucky in Michigan where we have the citizen lead ballot initiative process which means if we can write constitutional language as the people of Michigan and then gather\nA this last round three hundred and Fifteen thousand six hundred and fifty four registered Michigan voters signatures\nThen we can have the people in the general election vote 'em ... directly on a constitutional amendment and so what that Facebook post a group of us Internet stranger has ended up um deciding we wanted to work on something that would be good for any and Michigan voter no

conversation with Katie face he's a founder and executive director of voters not politicians David daily senior fellow at fair vote and the author of the upcoming book the rising and read Wilson national correspondent\nFor the hill a couple of you wrote us to respond to lower his message about Pennsylvania's redrawn maps not being in place for this year's election\nMark writes that the new Pennsylvania congressional maps are effective this election cycle Steve writes the state Supreme Court had to intervene to get a fair districts somewhere so badly gerrymandered districts formed pictures look at the old seventh congressional district\nThankfully the new districts are enforced for twenty Eighteen\nIn some of them say that the seventh congressional district in Pennsylvania looks like goofy and Donald Duck facing one another seriously just Google it\nSpeaking of which Maurice tweeted gerrymandering has transcended the political realm and infiltrated the fashion world he sent us a link to a website called gerrymander jewelry dot com\nMrs they sang gerrymandered jewelry has all these pictures six in fact of voting districts than North Carolina sixth district Texas is thirty fifth district's Louisiana six Florida fourth Michigan fourteenth and Ohio's first district and they're selling them as jewelry\nA hundred and Ninety five dollars each but the proceeds benefit of political action group is trying to get more Democratic governors secretaries of state attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states\nWe got a lot of comments read about the role of Republicans\nIn gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP as dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current maps it's gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to spend their losses\nIsn't fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantaged but what what what do we know well the Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and how they were Democrats came within one\nA odd numbered years so it it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia\nA but but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which is sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives uh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the there's no party is blameless in this\nUh gerrymandering started we get the word from a ... a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts\nUh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal and members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those do exist today a is to win all the districts around it\nOr the a newspaper ... in in Boston took a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander was a gerrymander ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the beginning of the republic hum you could argue that some of this happened back in in a female and democracy back in you know\nFive hundred BC uh but when we talk about today\nYeah both parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south that were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters\nAre and now even today we see some challenges to district lines drawn by Democrats especially in the state of Maryland\nUh there's one district to out in western Maryland they used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the lines and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes both parties do this Republicans have done it a more publicly lately\nAnd so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about a fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the winds aren't fair and therefore are are probably the ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish\nThe fact that that these lines may not be fair right but the people who who cry fairness tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils if you will\nDo get comments from folks on both sides of the aisle complaining about how both sides of the aisle tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the GOP is going nuts in Colorado over ballot initiatives to redistricting by a nonpartisan commission slow deep tweeted I Wish this was such a hot topic back when Democrats in my state had districts\nFour years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court was a majority appointed by Republican governors at approved by the Republican legislators nothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislator branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership been killed by Republican Sherman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and see so publicly\nTV fishy I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political but not partisan can you give me a sense of some of the conversations you've had with folks with if you've been witness to folks kind of talking across the aisle about this this this fuel\nPractically to you on the ground like a unifying issue\nYeah my experience really has been that um I mean in Michigan though we have had Democrats and Republicans control the line drawn process so maybe that helped but\nWe have volunteers or a Democrat to Republicans independents and I think that what we've seen is that no matter which party is in charge in Michigan they're really common sense things\nThat we all looked to government at at least help provide basic things like clean water or roads that aren't falling apart um those things aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know we there's also a Detroit is pretty gerrymandered they try and pack a lot of Democrats into one district but there there are still Republicans do you live in those districts into their voices aren't heard\nOr because a lot of these races are happening in the primaries and we don't really have competitive elections at the statewide level of Michigan we're a lot of people talking about even if they're\nThe of Fishell that their um representative at the party they leg they're much more extreme than what they would like to see\nAnd so I think that in Michigan in particular people have just had enough we feel like our government's doing a lot of overreach and want to help restore some transparency in the system especially for consistently ranked one of the least trans parents states when it comes to transparency in government\nUm and that's the biggest thing we heard all you're doing those town hall with a lot of people saying you know I don't know why the lines are being drawn than eight years later some emails coming coming out a talking directly about how the lines were drawn to guarantee one party an advantage or another\nAnd people are tired of it they want to be looked at as\nA lot of families who have giant voters not politicians to volunteer together even for my family it did work I'm happy that Thanksgiving dinner or your family yeah yeah I've got five hundred signatures and its canvassing every day they got thirty days until the election so\nIt's really exciting I mean you see a lot of people who are like you know there's nothing that we agree on but I really like working on this issue because\nThe basic concepts of fairness\nAnd an impartial sit down and a system that put that people first I think that there's some of our core democratic values that when you think about America you think about that and it resonates with people across the aisle and not always that the people who are right now in charge but the average voter we the support across the aisle", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Pullman", "day": "09"}
