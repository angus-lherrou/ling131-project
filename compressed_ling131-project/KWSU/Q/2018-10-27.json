G disappeared after walking into the Saudi constantly in Turkey more than three weeks ago Saudi officials first claimed she left the consulate than they claimed he just vanished than he they claimed he was killed accidentally while resisting Saudi agents now they've said that he was killing was premeditated\nCard to merge and why did the Saudis changed their story again why are they saying that this attack was premeditated\nThey question isn't it right now I'm just but instead of fatty version and the L Word investigating they keep finding things out\nOkay that's one thing except for that really doesn't ring as profitable because there has\nBeen under enormous pressure and scrutiny and criticism from the United states for each of these explanations they've put out as an independent at first that either he left the conflict than that it was an accident now that it wasn't an accident is pay meditate it\n... the story keeps shifting and that it is is reducing trust in the Saturday um credibility and Saudi relationship frankly the United states\nWith every kind of short stories shift and change it\nAnd you have basically at this plant the vast majority almost everybody in the political strata as bad you know what the national government saying look we really think that this um this was clearly been editing orchestrated\nThe way up to the crown prince and think about applying sanctions\nAnd the one person has to be convinced about all this is President Trump\nWho it is also shifting frankly he he originally said sure I found that friday explanations credible and then the last week or so has been saying I doesn't really seem like it's passing the smell test anymore but I'm the stakes are are are more than just the right and wrong about this case I mean the U.S

e mail us Saudi relationship make no mistake is a relationship of shared interests not a relationship on shared values whatsoever\nBrian emailed of course it's deplorable that the Saudis murdered this journalist is it not also deplorable that we are profiting from the sale of weapons being used by the Saudis to kill ...\nThose are two things that we have discussed earlier in this week we spend a whole hour on Yemen and this kind of proxy war taking place there we discussed that this week and you'll find that conversation and every segments of every broadcast on line at the one a dot org that's the word ... the number one deliver a dot org\nThe United nations estimates the group of migrants heading on foot towards the U.S through Mexico currently has about seven thousand people traveling north that number fluctuates course\nThis group of migrants has become the target of President Trump and other Republicans during the upcoming mid terms car and what do we know about the folks who are in this caravan who are they worded they come from and and what made them start heading for the U.S for\nFor the most part and they seem to be a migrants' that started off in Central America that have been moving up through Mexico that are heading to the U.S border and this is that than it has been organized to kind of make the point of the plight of the migrants that um\nI have been kinda travels a very very long way to get to the U.S border and are seeking to come to the United states for either reasons as at economic attraction or because they are ... and sort of threat um and\nFor for time to use in advance in the mid term elections say look at all the scary people coming towards our border there might be middle Easterners and they're you know how do we know that they aren't you not bad people in that group which is just to quote his terminology than it is a and this is kind of a poking at\nThe that that the existing um tension that exists in this country between people who are sympathetic toward the people who want to come to the United states for various reasons of personal safety and economic stability and everything else\nAnd those people who think a scary outsiders don't let them in this place real well with some Space Center kind of with up his base in advance of the mid term elections because they're public kind of need to hold on for dear life to make sure they keep\nThat majorities in both houses of Congress because of the house especially seems like it's quite likely to flip to Democrats\nAnd that will be at the problematic for Trump and the last two years his first term so it is um classic a it's a very emotional issue for people on both sides of this issue and this is a classic uh politicking for how it's being portrayed right now I'm In an eye\nOn television on nearly as as we are what two weeks out\nLoud you mix away from the point at which and everybody's going to cast their ballots healing how they feel about you know the issues that affect the country and how the president's got on with them\nAway before we continue talking about the care of and I'm Sorry I forgot to clarify something earlier and what we were discussing Michael Goldfarb raise the point\nAbout treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and we clarified that he did not attend the conference this so called Davos in the desert that is true but just to be clear the treasury secretary did meet with Saudis crown prince Mohammed bin saw him on on Monday in Riyadh he did not attend the conference\nBut at the end the crown prince did meet one on one earlier this week on\nMonday just by way of clarification\nRavi president troops sent ... President Trump sent troops\nTo the U.S Mexico border during the spring defense secretary James Mattis is authorized deploying eight hundred more troops to the southern border give us a sense of what role these troops might be expected to play there and how that might factor into this whole saga regarding the the caravan\n[noise] well it it really is as car ruined was pointing out apply as thoughts to play into the political debate here in the United states about these migrants making their way to the to the United states and the whole notion of securing the border is also is is a strange one on this because\nI mean if you look at who these migrants\nDoors in El Salvador Guatemala where they are escaping violence they are extremely poor they they as they are walking up a north towards the United states\nOn their agenda and their hopes and dreams quite clearly is to try and seek asylum in the United states why because they think that they could have better lives\nIn the United states they think that that children would have better lives and really there is no great a testament to American soft power that you have you know essentially all around the world people who want to vote with their feet and come to the the the United states than settle\nOn and have children and have better lives than simply\nAnd and so the troops are part of this larger\nA Trump in and and I guess Republican rhetoric to play into the the idea that some migrants who are coming are coming I'm a you know as sources of great danger when in ... in fact a you know if you look at the pictures of who they are and how they're coming in they are anything but\nAnd I also do want to point out uh current mentioned that President Trump\nOr use it to the ... a A R mentioned that uh these migrants are Middle Eastern well for one there's actually no evidence that points the fact that they could be Middle Eastern but perhaps more importantly he was using um Middle Eastern as a slur of sorts which which we ...\nWe should we should just clarify vice president Mike Pence said that there it's possible that mixed in with these thousands of migrants who were from Central America there may be a few dozen who were Middle Eastern and might have you know mysterious\nAims for the country that is exactly right thank you for the clarification that but the the point I was getting too was that the use of the of of of Middle East and that's just the um ... is extremely dangerous because it it it it then tries to create the the impression that being Middle East and\nI'm means you're dangerous so that you're a terrorist and and and that too is is is a dangerous loaded way of looking at as Carlin was pointing out again a movement that happens very often or you know migrants from from those parts of the world often try to make their way to the United states\nAnd the reason why this has become a bigger thing right now numbering in the thousands is because it has been politicized here in the United states\nMichael Goldfarb I Wonder if we should be careful with the language we use to describe this large group of people a number of you have comments to us about that with the\nAnd raised in Honduras I came to the U.S to study and now I live and work here this quote unquote caravan is a cry for help a cry of desperation from people who will risk their lives to escape the extreme poverty and violence that I Know Israel\nThey are indeed refugees seeking refuge please don't blame them blamed the corruption that has rotted the Honduran government\nAnd dug in Anthony tweet they are not migrants they are asylum seekers words matter now Michael Merriam Webster is my goats you in terms of the English language\nMerriam Webster defines a migrant as one who migrate such as a person who moves regularly in order to find work especially in harvesting crops a refugee is one that fleas\nEspecially a person who flees to a foreign country or power to escape danger or persecution what do you make of the words that we're using to describe this\n[noise] you know judge towards as you've been talking about this I I I suddenly had Woody Guthrie's old song\nAbout about a group of migrants being sent back to Mexico in the Nineteen thirties and their plane crashed\nAnd they were cold deportees it's a beautiful song you you look it up and ... I mean listeners should strict YouTube after the show and and give it a listen there are many versions of it\nYeah you you know look I and I do think that in this case there there is a distinction you know we have a human wave coming out of sub Saharan Africa and the horn of Africa towards Europe and it it's had a destabilizing effect on politics here as well\nAnd and I I Would identify most of these folks as as being migrants as opposed to people who come from countries\nVery much as a result of American policy not just in the Nineteen eighties but you know going back you know well into the twentieth century where you know the small Central American countries were often you know just fiefdom Z for\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the Alfred P Sloan Foundation bridging science technology and the arts by supporting exhibitions such a program to the Whitney Museum in New York City on view through April fourteenth more at Sloan dot org\n[noise] from the joys foundation committed to advancing racial equity and economic mobility for the next generation and the great lakes region learn more at Joyce F.

quality audio file and to keep up to date on a future topics will share some of your stories Monday when we wrap up our series the state we're in on one day\nBack now to our discussion with current emerging of the Washington Post ... of foreign policy magazine and Michael Goldfarb with the first rough draft of history the host and creator of that potash probably let me come to you though I Wonder what you think of the overall message of Tim Cook speech the c._e._o. of apple we heard him refer\nTo the data industrial complex\nWhich has been a phrase that's been quoted fairly often in the days since he spoke kind of\nHarkening back to that idea of the military industrial complex the prison industrial complex what did you make of of cooks remarks\nThought these were really strong words and coming from a taxi or perhaps the strongest we've seen so far now ... what he didn't stay in that speech was he didn't mention Google he didn't mention Facebook\nAnd that's bad because I mean while he doesn't want to go that far but but also because apple is a business is quite different from Google and Facebook apple doesn't it's not in the the er the ad tracking business the way Facebook and Google both awe\nBut I think what all of these companies know collectively that whether they like it or not regulation of some for some farm is is on its way it's coming and so at some level of the other they have all indoor or GDP are which is your data protection bill\nAnd I think they're beginning to imagine that some version of that will at some stage be implemented in the United states and\nThe only question that is is what kind of ...\nThe speech again very strong words in his visit to Europe is to try and come out ahead of it knowing that this is going to happen anyway to try and appear to be one of the ah the tech support as a all of a potential data privacy laws in the United states\nWe should be clear also GDP are as the general data protection regulation it's there's a new area law that protects the privacy of data privacy of individuals within the EU or even the export of their personal data outside the e you if you've noticed re in the last few months\nThat a lot of the Web sites you go to have had these pop up saying hey we use cookies on this website and we may be tracking your information click here to accept\nThat was those websites complying with GDP are that's why they all had to begin putting those pop ups on those sites another story about privacy that caught our attention the British newspaper the telegraph\nPublished an investigation on Tuesday into a wealthy businessman who was accused by multiple employees of racist and sexist miss treatment the story had the headline the British me to scandal which cannot be revealed\nThat's because the accused was granted an injunction against the newspaper to prevent it from publishing his name but then this happened at Britain's house of lords\nAfraid of this month juicy under parliamentary privileged to name for reading of the individual in question given that the media have been subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of his story which is clearly in the public interest\nThat was the voice of lord Hain or Baron the pain of nice in the British house of lords using British parliamentary privilege to name the billionaire at the center of this story Michael Goldfarb what's behind this what makes this\nSuch a big deal it sounds like it's kind of an example a clear example of the very significant differences between free speech laws in the u._k. and in the U.S\nWell that's certainly part of a dress rode in in this particular case I'm having a parliamentary privileges is pretty\nUnique tool you can say things in parliament that you cannot say outside and and not suffer and any libel actions and Peter hand was a working he'd been approached by some of the women who had spoken to the Daily Telegraph this this guy a Phillip Green is you know a fairly typical contemporary on ...\nA series of of um clothing shops over over the decades and made himself very very wealthy and indeed and um apparently he was just the kind of ball she would expect to was a bully and he was he sexually harassed people and\nLike Harvey Weinstein when when he settled up there were no disclosure clauses inserted into the settlements\nAnd the difference of course is that in the U.S New York times and the New Yorker can report that Harvey Weinstein is this and that and you know the details who can't get because of these nondisclosure agreements but at least we know his name and here in Britain it's something else\nWas you know moving oh go ahead Michael go ahead no no because I could go on about this guy forever and like what [laughter]\nWhat we're doing it on\nI was just gonna say it's it's an interesting case really because of the way that the British laws are structured to say to have that that this this question which is the greater good here right because that\nThat the me too movement it's already been a question of can you know the the little guy or the little girl in this instance you know stand up against a big powerful wealthy usually male and in player who's pulling things at ... ... for doing things that they shouldn't be doing but because of power and\nI'm inclined to able to get away with that it it kind of the perfect I'm ... and ... it's kind of the perfect at ... and I said it I guess to see what is\nWhat society kind of values protecting or is it that reputation as a kid in its way where I ... can be applied
