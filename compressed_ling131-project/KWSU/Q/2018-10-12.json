I I Do a lot of interviews and nobody ever asked me that type appreciate that [laughter] I'm good I think that like I'm a I'm I'm happy about being around people I knew before the protests and people that I Know really well I got to see my sister the other day and and she's grade and her two kids so\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Americans for the arts committed to transforming America's communities through the arts and arts education supporting the nonprofit arts industry which employs four point six million people nationwide learn more at American for the arts dot org\nAnd from the Alfred P Sloan Foundation bridging science and the arts by supporting the history of scientific theory misused in the eugenics crusade premiering October sixteenth on PBS more at Sloan dot org\nOne day I'm Joshua Johnson we are speaking to dream of testing the host of the podcast pod feed the people and the author of the new book on the other side of freedom the case for hope won by ... ethical thing I did want to ask you\nHelp lay the groundwork for activism [noise]\nUh you know it's funny how like don't you can myself is very old but I taught a decade ago my my students the students are like twenty Twenty one now which is so wild [noise] ah\nYou know teaching was incredible not only because it was urgent everyday like everything would add to shop and I talked to scream at every single dad to show up in our math to my students I had to be as prepared and I taught sixteen Ninety a hundred and twenty minute classes which is a whole lotta math for anybody who's ever around eleven year old\nUh what I learned there were a couple of things one was like how to take really complex information and break it down into\nPieces that are can be consumed and can be repeated back so my skill with like what I learned was not only how to like get kids to understand like when the crazy ones but like I did teach discreet skilled like you know when you think tattooed sometimes means multiplication right that like to how to take apart the big things to make them bite side and then\nHave students to be able to play with them in a way that they can put them back and rearrange on their on their own or the second was like really understanding what it means to\nLike do work that will have an immediate impact but we'll have a long term impacts so I remember I'll never forget teaching negative number they struggle they like they can get it like anything lower than the euro that like I don't get it\nBy the end they come like fight anybody around like how to solve the most complicated equation and they like deeply understood it and that was like understanding like the arc of how to build capacity um like I learned that the third thing is I mean they got the best teachers with the ... just walk in the classrooms and they know the gift existed long before they got their\n... and that like I work is to help students understand that they can access the gift long after I'm gone after the teacher's gone for the worse teachers do is walk in the classrooms and make people believe that the gift only exists in their presidents and like that is I think and touch a corollary to organizing that when I travel anywhere where I'm In my own community\nThat like what I'm trying to do is help people find the gift that they have because they already have them they might not know they might not believe they might not know how to use them\nAnd what I can do is help them find them and then used on long after we're gone\nLet's get some questions about the black lives matter movement Morgan writes black lives matter is purposefully without a central leader so how does he you direct\nTV with his role was in the movement what has he done to ensure that people do the names of the three black women who actually started B. L. M. thing Morgan's referring to Patrice ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the ...\nBut give that a you know for those of us who are industry and for a gift and we're mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protest there was no one to three ten people who caught us all to the street who organize everybody wants to beat up about the protests that\nIt was organic they were set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protest last and you have to remember that we ministry for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend which I'm fortunate that there's a narrative that if that has come up as a race to many people\nThat suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis who organized every body the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true someone I think about like how I use my platform how I think about my work\nThat I'm mindful that I was one of many people in the book I highly so many people were industry in St Louis who did incredible work from home without you wouldn't there would be no protest\nI said that important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exists for me that\nOne of the important things about having a platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people how to spread across the country like you've never heard those names and in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we went into the street together\nBut this narrative to death I guess most of the people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organization to like\nWhat the catalyst for the protest is just not a true narrative there's always this tension\nWith movements that have certain people certain leaders to become more prominent\nWith the concerned about but who profits off the cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast is a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help to cause\nYou know it's interesting I think I'm always show you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the\nThe way the question get that sound like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the ... in a portion of all the pre order sales went to the end up ... legal defense funds that went public I did it can it was important and and you know my way\nThe ... to like that talking about the book specifically\nBut in general in the space like I'm mindful of this and when we started camping zero which is like our biggest project that we started in twenty Fifteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of race for funding specifically because of the question that you asked\nTo over the past three years we raised up about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of non profits and we did it so that\nWe could just raise enough money to do the work that we dealt with important right so we created the first of all the database of police union contracts at first a public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done ever before continue to support organizes around the country and really disagree projects [noise]\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not a I'm a salary from the stuff so we try to do it is like\nWith just the bare necessities do that it's not just a question of like profit uh\nEnd with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense by Brittany salmon Clinton be a part of it they get paid as a part of the broadcast because I think that that makes sense um\nAnd it's not like some huge money maker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to rely on the nonprofit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well and you know it's a guy\nAt the way that I could just in the world right now is like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I don't have you know it's like a\nKnowledge at night and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like it was a really rough um it was rough\nOnly this only a couple of months ago and the first time that I'm actually lived alone in since the protests I've ever since you've been saying in the basement of a mess deck and parents are for the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not a ... you know wants to get married in the in the basement of their life second parents that's sustainable but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like\nThere are these narratives I'm like oh I made ... and it's like well no you see me on the news you hear him in a pod cast you like see me out of an event that that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case of that I've had high incomes and before you know that that there was any income and wealth it's pretty significant right though\nSaying one of the members of the one eight text club writes police hold a significant position of power in the legal system they should be held to a higher standard than those without power but instead they are held to a lower standard and given special treatment and a free pass in our courts and society\nContrast that with another ... who wrote\nAs time goes on society will bring about necessary reform but to denigrate and disregard for the entire police force as an institution is ludicrous\nWhat do you think I think you know I think for ... ... two thousand years we slit people's arresting called a health care we literally drained people's blood down and we were like ... it's going to drain out all the impurities\nAnd people were like oh they their blood pressure they change just like no they didn't have any blood writing like that actually isn't necessarily shouldn't but we did it for two thousand years it was one of the most popular medical procedures\nBut it didn't work so if the goal was it the people's lives like actually wasn't a good thing\nAt the goal was to like pretend that you were doing good then like this was excellent and I think about policing and pick up the goal is to stop crime or like to to do any of that work like it just isn't whether how no matter how you feel about the police that just isn't happening so\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the Charles Stuart Mott foundation supporting efforts to promote adjusts equitable and sustainable society and it's home town of Flint, Michigan and communities around the world more at ... dot org\nFrom the Epstein Family Foundation in support of the David Gilkey in ... amount of memorial fund established to support NPR's international journalists their coverage and their commitment to providing the news of the world to audiences back home and from Americans for the arts\nBack now to our conversation with during the catch in his new memoir is called on the other side of freedom the case for hope let's talk about some of the more personal aspects of your life that you describe in the book there's a short section in the book like page and a half\nWere you talk frankly about your mom leaving the family when you were a toddler and the fact that you never have asked her why she left\nA leader in the chapter you write code I'm mindful that we remember pain and trauma differently than we remembered joy and triumphs\nWhen we remember pain we are trying to protect ourselves and cope we're trying to order the memories in ways that will allow us to make it to tomorrow and the day after tomorrow unquote\nTalk about how those kinds of traumatic or difficult experiences as a kid kind of helped to shape you as an adult particularly an adult who would gravitate toward activists\nYou know it's interesting uh this is the first time saying this because it just happened is that my mother read the book um and she texted me recently and it was I hate to re read the book we should talk [noise] and I just haven't had a cabin\nAnd now with us that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter that I Know that we walk into everywhere I'm bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to have to work within and grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and that's important as we think about what it means to organize is that like we're all walking into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nCore part of it that the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy is that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty rates\nThat or any other aspect of it and they they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had the family and I knew what ... not to ask why new\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside I you know a lot of people talk about growing up poor but not sad\nOne of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraints sound like the constraints become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive that we can start that magic things beyond and if we're ever going to win you know be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd my eating by the diversity in the right and left is at the right has always re packaging old narratives for a new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe it you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but like we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling no story is actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good story to tell her about a future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you entered the world\n[noise] you also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times at a rather young age\nAnd you connect that was what he calls the quiet quiet about the assault but also quite about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never hidden any part of myself from my self or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love the parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote\nHow does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons either important for me to be out there\nAt the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gay to think that the only way to do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and ah you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know that doesn't mean it wasn't real like housing quiet and the closet\nAnd you know I I Walk into every room as a black man I'm like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of it has to be done in social justice or the work that we need to do\nWithout talking about a mile an identity that I wrote about the uh the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know\nUm [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt with free in some ways to finally just take it and like not have to tiptoe around it and not be ashamed to say that this happened in and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally taught a couple of years later they realized that he'd actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me um\nTo like you know speaking up actually made a different in other people's lives and like that was important\nUm but I've had to like you know I write about in the book is that like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were appearing than we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right [laughter] so I wanted to just get language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlets actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my own air career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people are OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things\nAnd that changes the conception do you find that there was a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know\nLet's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my identity than they have to be\nYeah you know like\nI think we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave the bike and there's not one way right that they're not two ways to be ...\nMe way rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is me just like going on a date and like that it and like those are both valid way to jump in and the identity that I Am right uh so so yeah there are definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not gay enough in like\nThat I don't talk about gay issues as publicly as possible and like you know one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life dry leaves like other people can feel like it's real re so like I Know that we were working with the research right now they're trying to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggested that\nIt's not that people when people don't get past that it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of their results but that ah\nThat they actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns in a nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cuts and a friend like that they actually are nervous about like what privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I have I don't feel like I Need to talk about that every two seconds for people to be like they're actually cares about being gay right so the other thing I'll say that there's some people who like a really homophobic but like me and that's not helpful that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bed for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quote\nThere were calls from within the protest community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling the a sellout unquote\nI Wonder how you are finding your way forward in these new endeavors whether it's politics hosting a podcast so any way you are part of a media so to speak\nAnd reconciling that was kind of the social justice activism work that you're still ... involved in is that challenging to kind of have a foot in both worlds as it were\nYou know it's like a both hands right that like you know what's interesting is that all those people who who come in for ... quote participating in the system those are the same people running for office today right those are the same people who like\nI tell them everybody to vote who tell people not to vote twenty sixteen who said that you're wasting your vote who said that politics didn't matter and like why would you support I remember I support Hillary and not washing posted people literally would like you're wasting your employment I Can't believe you did that like president doesn't have any bearing this is just for show and it's like\nNobody is saying that now that is\nLike people getting it took all of the chaos that that the president continues to\nTo put in the face and you think about even there are a lot of really really public people and movements aid to literally just would not say anything about Hillary that wasn't she was a monster and like you don't have to agree with all the Hillary tough to know that like she was a better choice in this guy so [noise] so that was sort of interesting uh", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "12"}
