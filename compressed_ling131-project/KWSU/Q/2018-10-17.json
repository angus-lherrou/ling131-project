[noise]\n\n\nThis is one day I'm Joshua Johnson in Washington Leslie stall or sixty minutes is a renowned journalist but there's one thing I'll bet she's no better than you are debating climate change it came up during her latest interview with President Trump\nI Wish you could go to Greenland\nI watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean raising the sea level and you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man you don't know whether you're a scientist your scientist that no no I haven't had it's understood disagree with that you know I I was thinking\nWhat if he said now I've seen the hurricane situations\nI changed my mind that really is climate change and I thought wow what an impact\nWhat an in when I went on to make I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about on the news they say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just said was Michael ... says that they say when they do say that in the ... what about scientists some say it's worse than ever\nClearly climate change it's tough to discuss despite overwhelming scientific evidence of its existence\nHit you over their head with a bunch of facts and figures Supreme Lee confident that they are right and you are wrong how would you feel or if someone flat out refused to hear you out despite the fact is being really clear and just dug in their heels to avoid feeling like they lost an argument would that be like\nWe want to elevate the debate to change the way we talk about climate change and we want to hear from you where do you stand on the issue and what is it been like discussing it with people whose views are different from yours what's worked and what has not\nJoining us from K. U. L. W. public radio in Seattle is Sarah ... a research associate at the University of Washington she holds a PHD in ecology from UC Davis\nShe also founded the ... Institute a group that empowers leaders to tackle climate change Sarah welcome to want to say thanks for having me joining us from NPR in New York is poll Bledsoe a lecturer at American University's Center for environmental policy American owns W. A. M. U. the station that produces won a\nHe's also a former climate advisor to the Clinton White house and a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute poll welcome thank structural Sarah I Wonder if we should just frame of discussion very clearly first of all this is a conversation that's for skeptics and believers alike right this is bigger than just\nIs climate change real do this kind of feels to me like the human aspect\nOf working our way through this issue right\nYeah I definitely think there's something that impacts all of that political decision making aspects of our public life right now how we're integrating science and how were you how we're essentially distorting science across the partisan divide that Israeli characterizing this political moment in our nation right now\nNow we heard from President Trump and that sixty minutes interview just a few minutes ago on that note John left us this note in our inbox\nMy question really is why does the president insist on denying that climate change as fact and that global warming is something that we have to contend with that a nation as a nation\nFor NPR comes from this station and from the doors do charitable foundation whos clinical scientists development towards support promising early career physician scientists and their research efforts to improve human health\nFrom the George ... foundation working to make Cleveland and northeast Ohio more globally competitive livable sustainable and just more information available at gun foundation dot org and from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson we're discussing climate change and what we discuss when we discuss climate change with Sarah ... founder of the ruined Institute and Paul blood so a promissory Electra at American University Center for environmental policy\nWherever you are on the spectrum of belief with regards to climate change what kind of conversations are you having with people in your life about climate change have you been ...\nIt's been like for you comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org we know that for quite a few of you discussing climate change can be difficult some of you been giving us your suggestions\nFor what has worked for you and what might work Melissa writes for my Bible friends I remind them that we are called to be good stewards of the earth\nNothing the environmentalist or suggesting would cause harm from my fiscally conservative friends I talk about the economics green power is more profitable and this the future autonomy more jobs better jobs saving the earth for their grandchildren is way down on the list\nWe also heard from some of you who are dealing with the difficulties of discussing climate change Caitlin left this note in our inbox\nOr we were all around the world go round at the time and I'm very interested in protecting the environment\nTeaching I think about climate change\nI Want to know ways in which I can better explain my staff to others are\nJust regular people who might not have the education that I had at that climate change because from where I'm standing at plainly ... what's going on and it just seems like we really need to come together and actually make a change or there's going to be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with his poll I Wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just outdoor comment the terminology often gets us in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all this\nIt's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy\nSolutions with a policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action we know that we have to peak global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership lead\nStates denies factual information over twenty year period federal ex president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters may reflect that in this midterm election\nGeorge tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focus on telling people about the immediate and local clean air health benefits that will go to people in locations taking action to address climate change pollution and reducing fossil fuel burning irrespective of opinions on climate\nKatie emailed my family has vacation to Mexico beach in Florida for twenty plus years and we have many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael my father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much\nHe won't consider that just maybe there is a greater thing at play here what is it going to take for this to change how do we those who are convinced that is happening change the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation\nNurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she's in and the laws that her family is\nStruggling with to describe and\nYou know this is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information as like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me like six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it\nPeople can get exposed to that that science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think is through and through relationship and trust an apathy on because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with\nThe scale of change and the crisis you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger\nUm [noise] I ... all of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions we shouldn't into our part in corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world is and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing world view and that's why\nStation is one of the way to start\nSarah if I could just doing it a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being\nA little compassionate might also speak to the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean it's hard not to read the latest report from the UN's climate change which we discuss last week on this program\nAnd not feel like well we're all going to die anyway why bother run up your credit 'cause they're not going to be radical acts you know what I'm saying like it just feels like an intractable problem and I wonder is maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way would go a long way\nWell I Want to come up yeah I got it and I I Want to remind remind us that as we sit\nWith the privilege of western lifestyles and we look at the science that we've invested public money into you know remembering that we're living a science fiction and fantasy right now and we can look to human history and see that there are many other cultures around us\nAnd specifically in the U. S. Native American and indigenous Native American people who have already experienced the kind of cultural eradication that we are looking at down the line\nAnd the the consequences from climate change if we can look at the stories of human tenacity\nAnd how people struggle and survives through massive massive chef we know these stories and we can inform our strengths and resilience our courage by looking at the stories of for example the water protectors and the people who are standing at the front lines right now saying\nThe earth is precious we only have one planet and we're all going to show up and\nI'm informed that the you know the public's eye of the necessity of staying in this place and and things vigilant I Would\nJust go go ahead go ahead but oh I Would just add that\nThe St Louis is a reasonable reaction if you don't know the full range of solutions\nThat there's a lot of good news here\nAgo we eliminated one of them six main greenhouse gases it will no longer exist on earth Twenty years from now with the golly agreement to phase out HFCs\nTurns out there three or four other super pollutants like methane and black carbon if we can reduce these quickly about three times the current rate\nWe can limit near term warming and prevent\nThe climate crisis and actually solve it to exactly to combat that fake lives in which is a serious problem and I I really do feel empathy for people who are overwhelmed by a ... a little further what our HFCs\nAgencies are hydra floor carbon or manmade gas that ironically are used in refrigeration huh in air conditioners\nAnd they're growing incredibly quickly because we phased out an earlier set of CFCs chlorofluorocarbons\nTo fix the ozone hole by the way it's worth noting that that happened under Ronald Reagan a Republican so also noting that the acid rain problem was solved under George W Bush a Republican Republicans have historically taken very responsible positions\nOn environmental problems but they've gone off the rails lately and we need to help them help them back\nI didn't realize that HFCs these are some of the the refrigerant chemicals are kind of kind of safe and the heat out of a refrigerator and help advance\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the Annenberg Foundation committed to supporting educating and engaging communities in the United states and globally for

conversation we would love your help with tomorrow's program about being Native American\nMassachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren recently announced that a DNA test has confirmed what she said all along that she is indeed of tribal heritage the test was a ... back to President Trump who mocked her for claiming that heritage and refer to her as Pocahontas\nCritics including some tribal leaders said direct ancestry matters more than DNA testing in this regard it's just one of many issues that may have Native American voters talking head of the midterms\nIf you are Native American what has claiming your heritage meant to you what tribe or are you part of and how does that factor into your life\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a now if you're not Native American then share what your heritage means to you especially if it's something you learned about a little later in life what did you discover and how did it change you\nTell us your story eight five five to three six one a one way or you can leave us a radio quality audio files through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Sarah my ... and Paul blood so let's get in a few more of your questions and comments before we move on Noel tweeted I teach clients to think of anxiety kinda like sugar a little gives you energy to get going and too much shut you down and dreams you\nNeed to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and Paul I wonder if you could respond to hurling\nTo try to mitigate it in their own personal lives there still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with the thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical\nWhen you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take large policy action to reduce emissions in the United states and globally to make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions\nTo solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who acknowledge like uh the congressman from some South Florida\nUm but there are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not\nStrong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace and stare at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation and the useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would have happened ... years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that well\nMean that things are happening right now so [laughter] they have to have it in that um that that those protections are coming through I mean all of that pieces of protection that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentration thing we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal thanks I guess the issues not just that we're having winter\n[noise] yes and there's so there's complexity and how the regional climate and the seas analogy of different places are influenced by they the the on the Arctic\nWeather system basically a collapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities why\nOn people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate ... we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and the the climate for our planet has been ... oscillation between glacial an inter glacial state abrupt warming into enter glacial\nFollowed by slow cooling into glacial state so that pacing of glacial enter glacial warming that cold too warm structured that was fundamentally paste by changing geometric relationship between the earth on Sarah backup\nOranges along the changing geometric relationship between glacial and enter glacial stayed last me it's so cool it's amazing what it's confusing like like bring nurse\nFrom it okay so in a ... million years the planet's climate has been moving between glacial states\nWhere there's an eye on top of North American and erasing continent sea level is lower um it's a colder climate on and then in ... states so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift\nThis on this ... thing that I'm oscillation its ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate and that heartbeat from cold too warm or cold too warm that heartbeat was paste\nBy the ... and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and earth tilt as it moves around the\nSun so I only make sure all following you just yeah just heartbeat this earth heartbeat between hold too warm\nCold too warm it's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest the heartbeat as off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it to us is that that what you're saying that exactly right I like them or if it's been okay that makes a youthful\nPattern that's been on that's been happening for the last ... years we ... we have fundamentally disturbed that pattern I was out\nThere on a super high cholesterol sugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof and um the climate system can't take that forever that will go out of control\nWho questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work through that\nI I understand that you can distress individual scientists but there's not a conspiracy of\nTens and hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to create a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many cases their understanding the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now in imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed a degree and a half Fahrenheit we're on our way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit and it could spin out of control and that that's just the factual information I\nI I think we went with very few people actually denied about ten percent Fifteen Percent of the u._s. public actually\nDenied climate science would I think we have to do is galvanized the Seventy five eighty percent who broadly accepted into action\nPublished so former climate advisor for the Clinton White house process or your lecture at American University Center for environmental policy\nAnd a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute Paul thanks very much for talking to us thank you judge them and Sarah my re PHD research associate at the University of Washington and founder of the ... Institute Sarah thank you you're so welcome [noise]\nThere are good reasons to be concerned about our politics the division the tribal ties that seem to get into way of finding agreement and compromises we just discussed but we're not alone no matter how fraud things maybe come here between now and the midterms\nAt least we're not trying to work out a divorce it's lasted more than forty years and that will probably cost about fifty billion dollars\nTo the negotiations on any time that the reason it don't matter because of the future of our country and I think every community kind of country the all time off and on democracy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Pullman", "day": "17"}
