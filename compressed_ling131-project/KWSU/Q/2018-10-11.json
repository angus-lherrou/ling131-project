three\nThink it's very well executed as a musical and a sense as a as a as a realization of the energy of rock\nAs a complete showcase for what makes Lady Gaga great artist and performer I'm an as an immersive experience I have a lot of problems with the fundamental story and I'm and problems with the chemistry between the two stars so\n... as I guess for the music sums up for the movie I don't

we will be discussing all the details of this movie so if you haven't seen the star is born yet but you want to you might want to listen to this conversation later on line at the one a dime\nOn the line hey Heather what's on your mind what'd you think of the movie\nHey well of course I loved it but I loved it for entertainment value but my big piece was that moment when he brought her onstage and knowing that was not her comfort zone knowing what she'd been told that she wasn't going to be good enough\nThat no one would care that no one would find her interesting or attractive\nAnd she just went out and she killed it and they loved it in for that have second ISI that she realized they were wrong and everything they said to her that was a pretty important moment if you're someone who's been afraid to put yourself out there for the same reasons is kind of a big moment\nYeah I I I hear you on that just did that resonate for you in a way like was there something personal that that made you flash back to er sad about ...\nAbsolutely yeah I think you know I Do a lot of things where I have to go out in front of crowd or in front of people and you often hear you know you need to be dinner or project lower or beat this or that are younger\nAnd at that moment with kind of all of this it was kind of all of us will have that moment that we can personalize it whether it's your interview or what have you and I think that was an important\nElement Heather what'd you think about that whole storyline was her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her no\nYes yes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she's like this is my name is all me to take me as I Am and she worked at it\nYou know got tend to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and um I thought it it kind of the deal\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's an alley billboard and he says we should have just a bold billboard you're knows\nA thing about the comments about our nose and it's also a guy guys honoring Barbra Streisand [laughter] and one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a exist and and thrive\nIn Hollywood as far as coming up the music industry it absolutely is of a powerful comment on the music industry as the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think that where this thing is placed in time where this movie its place in time it's interesting to think about that because\nAlmost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's really no acknowledgement of how things\nThey both having less power than they used to so it's almost like old fashioned in its view of the music industry but only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really tackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also chime in but by the way which for those who have not seen the stars born will not be seeing stars form of just kind of want to be in on the conversation she tells Bradley Cooper is character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are you saying well but your nose you know just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that\nHad prevented her from getting where she wanted to go into homes I Wonder how you view the commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie I felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art\nI also thought about pink\nWho is very much and invention of pop music but you also have this kind of rye cynical filed style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in this film in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some way it is very linear it's a very linear idea of there is the one I'm rose to fame there is one pass you just simply a stand or deep sand as opposed to\nThere is no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in a a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like that he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming with out kind of going through that traditional path agree with Anna about that but I think\nThat um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them passed each other on this fame ladder and I think you kind of have to construct it that way and what you're saying about Lady Gaga you know I'm the caller was talking about kind of seeing\nA alley the character talking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist's like Lady Gaga who has been so able to make such an indelible mark on the industry and on top\nIf you're talking about the real people just kind of funny to see her big personality taking advice from now Bradley Cooper they've had a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right and it's odd and that way\nYeah except for voicing rocketing guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diversion but you're right I mean he is much more of like typical leading man actor I Wonder also John in terms of\nThe story line you know one of the big parts of the storyline is the love story and Bradley spend a lot of time sitting up that first time meeting here's a piece of that moment from a star is born when they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga is character alley is just improvising a love song\nTammy Paul [noise]\nBack in time can do that [noise]\nTo me [noise]\n\nTo me [noise]\nBradley Cooper Lady Gaga in a star is born Cooper spoke to NPR's MORNING EDITION with the host Rachel Martin about his work and said this about working with Lady Gaga\nAnd then we went to the piano and saying and it was just kind of wonderful thing I couldn't believe it\nSo that was the beginning of the journey and the first time we sang together I mean everything's ... we say we sing everything live in the movie wow you there's nothing we're not just lives thinking\nAnd I turned to Lady Gaga who's seen next to me and she was looking at me like I was Jackson, Maine when any when you're in that scene is actors fully believing that you're the character you cannot believe it yourself so she really gave me that confidence Bradley Cooper\nSpeaking to Rachel Martin on NPR's MORNING EDITION John horn what did you make of the collaboration between Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga particularly how it came out in the way the love story played out\nIs my big problem with the film and I think for a lot of people it's not an issue it was for me when her character an alley first meets jak here they stumbling blackout drunk and I think it looks as if he's just been a weekend at a bar do Kevin\nInteresting he's he's increasingly mean he has petty and I think as his alcoholism ... becomes words he continues to treat her worse and yes he's Bradley Cooper and yes he's is incredibly talented musician but I never really bought fully what alleys saw in him\nThat made me want them to stay together and that was my big problem as a couple um and there's a line later in the movie where one of ... says she loves you too much to tell you the truth I just thought that line was just really dated and not terribly truthful\nComes

more of your calls now gene is listening in Indianapolis hey gene what did you think of a star is born can you hear me\nYes I have a five stars which why five stars [noise]\nUm actually I just loved everything about this I've actually seen the other versions and this one seem particularly well updated to today um I thought it was the the irony of her being discovered\nBecause he was a drunk and looking for a drink and their life being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was the continuing sane and one one thing I don't think other people have mentioned is the part that her agent\nI guess he was her agent uh the guy who made her over\nThe manager do agent played yeah what what did you may have been character\nI didn't like him and I I guess I wasn't supposed to but ah the minute he had that conversation with Jackson um and and basically getting ready to accuse ... are accusing him\nOf being a problem in that whole relationship I just I just knew that that was going to be the start of of something really bad happening\nYeah yeah I I I hear your dream a hundred percent of ... and I I think I heard you chime in as well\nNo that was male ... yeah I think I think one of the tricks and it's gotten a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of the story one of the tricks with the manager and I think\nThey do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is I'm thinking about mental health and they made her seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she's been wary\nDetermine tragic ending in which um he died with suicide and so I think the manager I think the conversation with the manager unfortunately it seems like a forced element that\nIt doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes in to just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed debt because when he's been through these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate in a lot of different ways for sure but\nYou know did the movie really deal with the job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough to drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film led by agree\nWith you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell and there was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour and make it happen or or we're done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example she goes on said to her with her and he can't keep up or he keeps we're getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened to someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right so that would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way for me\nIt exactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that's part of that the narrative issue with the ending\nWas oh go ahead and go ahead\nWell of course of course the the ways in which\nA Hollywood and the fame machine or the fame monster as Lady Gaga once called it and one of her album ah destroys people is a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of stars born in there and in fact all the bridges of the stars weren't have that manager character in a different embodiment\nUm that character in this film I\nAbsolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions he almost with a sympathetic enabler um of of the male lead and who then was like hey you know we're trying to keep them\nVersions so the story of Hollywood destroying people um requires that a a stand in for the machine be part of being part of the cast you know has to be there um\nI also just want to say before we end gotta get this out there that um\nThis is also the story of how a woman's arise leads to a man's fall [laughter]\nAnd then that internal problem with the stars bar and you know\nUm it's a melodrama it's it's a melodrama is traditionally aimed at women we feel very sympathetic\nA toward the lead female character but there is this underlying sense have to say that even as Jackson, Maine\nIs saved temporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically from his young protege ultimately he is destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushing the periphery\nFeminist raining problematic\nWell but you're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a feeling male ego is the wrong story in this meat to era\nWe get to a few more if your views of the film Harvey in Ann Arbor emailed I saw this film hoping to be moved crying deeply engaged that didn't happen for stars\nI deeply appreciative ... new wants to shyness in her early portrayal which made Maine's characters advising her work well I'd like to have the same Eliot brother character better developed possibly a moment perhaps a moment could have been written in the car rides the bar possibly dropping him off from the performance\nHis scenes seemed a little too detached from me overall I Love the big venue concert treatments\nThat kind of gets to a comment from Argo in ... North Carolina who tweeted three stars a star is born was a story\nThe performances especially the musical ones were fantastic and the cinematography was incredible I expect a lot of nominations to come for deep ie the director of photography cinematographer\nMatthew ... production designer Karen Murphy costumer Aaron been knocked score original song\nAnd editing John horn spoke with the cinematographer Matthew Lee ... about shooting live performances\nWhich are not really straightforward spaces to navigate here is a part of that conversation from Cape PC sees the frame in this film was very difficult to sort of um\nI'm borrowing stages or that were already set up with the lady that was already existing and putting in our own crowds and then there was the hum running guns sort of we have ten minutes to shoot in between two sets with a real audience\nApologizing in thanking the audience for I'm sort of I'm shooting a movie in between two bands and then we had the third which is the Greek theater which in which shallow was performed where we um we actually in more of a movie fashion was able to create the Greek theater as a set\nAnd put a certain amount of crowded and so that was my most controlled um scenario\nBut the lighting of it had to have a consistency and like my goal was that um you know in creating a a character from sort of ocean retiree standpoint Jackson, Maine might as well be um [noise] oh I don't know Jack White and I had to make sure that the\nThe audience maybe subconsciously felt that this is his lady you know this is his road show and it's also in the film in the sort of visual movement of it all representation of rock and roll it\nThat was Mathew petite the cinematographer on a star is born speaking to John horn on Cape you see seeds to frame John can you talk a little bit more about the making of this film particularly back to Kathleen question who wrote on Facebook how you can tell if a film is well directed this kind of a film\nThe way that Matthew described it presents all kinds of additional challenges to make it a well directed films shooting in so many different kinds of locations\nYeah I think the ultimate question about what is it is not a well directed film it's do you believe that do you believe you're watching Bradley Cooper or do you believe you're watching Jackson mad if you think you're watching the actor you're not in a well directed movie if you are with the character\nYou earned a well directed moving there are certain different ways to achieve that and I think Bradley Cooper does achieve it and I think one of the things that he achieved really well is an ... talked about this this seeing the performance of shallow", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Pullman", "day": "11"}
