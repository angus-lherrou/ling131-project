work day if you feel very guarded at work you're not alone and it turns out how your boss behaves has a lot to do with your answer to that\nBernie brown has spent years researching effective leadership is a follow up to her groundbreaking findings on shame vulnerability and whole hardness applying those findings to the world of work\nRound is a research professor at the University of Houston graduate College of social work her new book is called dear to lead during greatly and rising strong at work and she joins us here in Studio ... brown welcome to what I Am excited to be here\nI read the book and you say early in the book that it does follow up to a lot of your previous work I imagined\nBruce you had your develop through your research and apply them were practically especially because you do speak to a lot of business groups were across the country around here\nI Do I so I spend about for the past five years I Would say I spend Ninety percent of my time in organizations working with leaders and talking about leadership innovation and creativity uh recently talking about a A R I and machine learning and kind of the consequences of that that the rise of the machine\nSo you know for me\nIt was probably I don't know six or seven years ago um\nWe had this mission at kind of where I work at our organization of making the world are braver place and it really struck me that if we don't change the way we work we can't change the world because we spend too much time at work\nUm and I think everyone listening at least my experience has been when that's a bad experience with NASA toxic environment\nWhen we are in bad relationships at work our whole lives go just fall apart\nOne of the things that you've described in your speeches I forget which of your tied talks it was but you talked about how business group started reach out to you and they say they want you to talk about creativity and innovation and and the future but but please don't bring up shame vulnerability or any of that difficult stuff and your response to that was\n[laughter] I can see why you have a problem [laughter] you know it right there I mean that's the thing so\nIf you don't have a culture that is prepared and understands failure sat back and disappointment don't ask people to innovate because failure is a prerequisite for innovation is by that you know you bankrupt innovation on its own term it's when you say nothing can fail\nYou know and then what happens and I think we see is a lot today and I think we see it in civic organizations government corporations faith communities we see people only doing what they're already good at doing\nAnd and we were the problems are too big that we face today\nDo you think that we're more like that now that we've been in the past or we kind of always been like this and we're just noticing it\nDifferently so hard question um you know data wise I Can't tell you I haven't done like a longitudinal retrospective on it but what I can say as I started my research obviously coincidentally six months before nine eleven\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the doors do charitable foundation whos\nClinical

dot org\nJust won a I'm Joshua Johnson we're discussing empathy and vulnerability and how they can help make some of the best employees boss\nWe learned today that a high profile woman in the Trump Administration is leaving her job at the end of this year Nikki Haley as America's ambassador to the United nations and this morning she announced her resignation in the resignation letter Haley says she plans to return the private sector after fourteen years in public office\nHe was formerly the governor of South Carolina has somewhat international reputation for being willing to take on her boss from time to time she told the New York times she doesn't agree with the president on everything but says there was a right and wrong way to address that will pick up the phone call them or meet with him in person\nShould also be remembered in part for striking back at White House adviser Larry Kudlow who suggested she might have been confused regarding Russian sanctions she told Fox News with all due respect I don't get to infuse\nShe and the president but today at the White House she lavish praise on him and his family he was part of what ambassador Haley said\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared ... is such a\nGenius that no one understand I mean to redo the NAFTA deal to weigh in on what I've done working with him on the middle east peace time it is so unbelievably well done and author of the great friend and they do a lot of things behind the thing\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're that our country because they're in\nThe ministry and you also just have to say I'm certainly thank you to my family Michael at the same and I'm like the little ones I adore them and for team usa wins you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time and energy into it um but they have a lot of heart\nReally wanted to make America\nI'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is any good slate and on for the next disaster to come in but now I don't have anything that I'm where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was\nI was governor for six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand year ... shooting a school shooting with a lot and then they come in\nAnd just two years have Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to be ... to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so thank you for five minutes\nAnd I will say that on our own here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty I can promise you what are we doing campaigning for it\nUs to the United nations speaking this morning at the White House announcing that she will be resigning at the end of the year\nBack now to our conversation with Renee brown and maybe by way of a transition we should get to an email ... writes I've noticed more attention since the twenty sixteen election of President Trump how has that changed for work environment ... have you noticed a difference\nAnd absolutely ... absolutely I don't think work I think this is the whole point work is not immune from the larger culture and I think we have seen just like we've seen increased polarization in our families and our neighborhoods and mine are friends is at work too and it feels dice here at work\nUm I think that people have to be careful on especially when there's power differential Z and it it's I I actually believe it's become a pretty significant source of anxiety at work at home\nJust being able to talk politics or culture or any of these other dividing line\nThere because everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural today where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nTo let's see I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to kind of open up\nIf that ... toward keeping the professional and personal separate that at work I just needs to be this one person I Need to keep my head down and get to not make waves I Need to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there\nAnd the minute that we start talking about emphasizing and being vulnerable and bring it up and compassionate and ... that opens the door for me to say something about how I voted or you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love that's going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like\nIt's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of\nLess I think you're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I've never seen anything meaningful are significant come from mouth shut had down\nAnd my career that's just not how we make contributions\nAnd so what we have to do is learn how to listen talk here each other and rumble and we use the term rumble because it really feels like a rumble rumble with the vulnerability of seeing other people as people and being seen as a person and\nIt's a muscle it's a foundational skill\nOur adult lives at work I don't think spending half of our adult lives in armor\nIs something that most of us are willing to do I think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high\nAnd we're not solving problems I Need you to bring all of you to work I Need the combination of all of your experience as all of who you are to address the problems\nFrom reading your book and based on the research that fuel to book a lot of what you describe points to that kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a star star is tough because the wind is tender right and so if there wasn't something tenders there'd be nothing to protect\nYou know that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really\nIt was actually voided my hypothesis going in so where did you drop off yeah yeah it just it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at Jesse what I'm going to find but not in this case\nSo we asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders there it's a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred and fifty sea level global leaders\nThree years building a daring leader assessment that people can see where they are and these were NBA and NBA students at Wharton catalog Rice University and then\nTons of data evaluation data so I thought when when when it was clear that the future of leadership is about courage we need greater leaders and more courageous cultures I thought the barrier what's going to be fear\nBut then we went and talked to several dairy leaders and said so you're not afraid very often and they're like\nWhat I'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long I was like so that blew my hypothesis of fear being the greatest barrier to dairy leadership\nThe greatest barrier to daring leadership is armor it's not the fear it's how we self protect when we're in the fear is the perfectionism the pleasing the defensiveness the anger\nHaving to be the nowhere and get everything right instead of being the learner\nUm so really you know and it's interesting what she said about scars and tender places\nNot only does armor keep other people from seen us and sharing ourselves with other people armor protects the fear and less it faster and grow and metastasize\nDid we are some of you to call in and tell us about your workplaces here's what two of our listeners left in our inbox first let's hear from Adam\nMy name is Adam and I'm calling from Nashville, Tennessee\nI'm a paramedic and firefighters and as such I definitely feel like I Need to do my job perfectly at all times because there are definitely times one lives livelihoods or on a lot of jobs\nOn the other hand I worked for a department that's very good about forty ... or ... and my co workers and I definitely do a good job of trying to share in better get stressed at the job\nAdam thanks very much for calling and sharing your story with the snow contracts Adam's story which is the bill's story she works in a similarly strict workplace was a rather different take\nOn a doctor at a big hospital and it's just really hard to suggest that anyone to feel safe there you have to watch everything you say in jail and there's so many corporate compliance policy I Would say like it's not a safe place to be human at all\nIs the bill we appreciate you sharing your story as well bringing it sounds like they're one might think that being in one of these high pressure leadership environments would lead to more common experiences with both of these folks are in places where lives are on the line with wildly different experience is what's the variable that makes a difference there\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Americans for the arts committed to transforming America's communities through the arts and arts education supporting the nonprofit arts industry

world is talking about a new report by some of the most renowned climate scientists putting a finer point on just how little time we have to do something about our warming planet the report states that we have until about a year twenty forty\nBefore we reach a point of no return it also gives a reason for hope that we have the skills to do something if we work together\nWe want to answer your questions about what it would practically take to fight climate change leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a we'd also love to know what you're working on to fight climate change in a big way tell us your story eight five five\nTo three six one a one way or you can use our app won a vox pop to send us a high quality audio file and to keep up to date on future topics you

O. X. P. O. P.\nIn the app store and we'll share some of your questions and stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with burn a brown author of the new book dear to\n... and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah I mean boundaries are actually a big part of this box down trees are incredibly important [noise] um we defined it very simply as what's OK and what's not okay [noise] and so armor is not about\nProfessional management of south it's not about four going boundaries armor is about defense in it is I Am going to put the protection of my ego before\nDoing right by this business and the work that we're doing together I'm honored to protect feeling good about myself over moving our work forward\nSo there's a difference between say armor and image\nSuch as kind of self that you portrayed other people to kind of keep bad things and it's it's ... it's on a deeper level now it's on a deeper\nInto one of the greatest examples that armor armored leadership versus airing leadership has one form of armor we see a lot and folks is that need to be right that it's that I've got to be the network and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being a learner and getting it right\nWe got a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into workplaces and hope emailed can you speak about the ways in which racial power structures and broader society that manifest themselves in the workplace\nDisproportionately impact the contributions of people of color in their work and the extent to which they progress in their careers before you answer here's one example professor ... tweeted\nAs a woman of color an immigrant and an academic I've learned that showing vulnerabilities and even my own resilience can and will be used against me by those in power would love to hear professor brown talk about overcoming distrust well here's what\nAre the biggest findings I think is that\nOne of the greatest casualties of trauma\nIs the is the loss of vulnerability and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic incident I mean racism homophobia poverty white supremacy I mean privilege\nThose are those are everyday traumas and it is real that that ... that you know the army that you need to survive those things Israel which is why it's leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off and be seen\nThen we can't I mean gender is another you know I\nTestimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of fun during a way that we're more it's when you got your guy who was\nYou know but absolutely vulnerability can be used against us on and I think that is that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talk about core values and I don't think any of us has worked at a company that doesn't have some\nKind of mission statement or vision clarification or posters everywhere thing but for those who are supposed to be and then it's really worth nothing more than a paper on which was printed I work at some companies\nWind been to some companies where their values statement was like Fifteen bullet points la I'm like well what what we're even start\nYou suggest that we should limit our core values to to just to and there's a long list in the book I'm trying to find a because there's a lot on the list that I really struggled barrel down to my to why only two\nWell here's the thing if you don't operation allies and values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating that you just really do have a cat tester\nI mean it really it was just really a poster so like I'm a recording of my head that little will tell you [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter] you know and\nSo what was so you know operation lies values into behaviors fewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with had actually done that had taken the time to say you know what\nI some assumption of generosity is our value and here are the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in\nAnd so the two is\nReally kind of backing into the data\nThat men and women\nWho had the capacity to be the most courageous can identify their values and\nThey had two to three values and you know I have you know there's a long list in the book like we talked about and there's like Fifteen things on there that are important to me\nAltruism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independent self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I there's probably Fifteen or twenty things\nWe are facing courage and I know that the core values because it's a place where every other thing on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we have an we had a companion work buckets free downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operational ice an end to behaviors um he's changed completely the way we all work together\nWe all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them and then we have our company values and that's actually how we assessed shoot every quarter\nLoose on the values that you were to win\nLike for example one of our values is take the care taking care of each other or south and the community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talked to people\nI mean either do it or you don't\nAnd so I think it goes back to something we haven't talked about yet that as a real core finding which has courage is one hundred percent teachable\nIt's for skill sets each of the skill sets are behavioral and can be taught it's learning how to rumble with on her ability living into your values which we're talking about right now\nIt's braiding trust understanding how to talk about trust and breaking it down so we can talk about the anatomy of trust and and learning how to rise how to get back up on your feet after a fall or a setback\nDo you need to declare these values I mean I I Would be fascinated to know what you looked me right now see my to core values are because I Know what they are I went through the list I finally figured out my too but I don't know that anyone would guess what my to war based on who I Am the work I Do like\nI guess one sure catcher I sure OK face no\nThere's not one of my two chords but it's incompetent what am I to Coleman's but no I didn't tell us what you are I don't know maybe I should maybe I shouldn't and we're talking about on her daughter's Russia I Know but I'm the host I don't have to do and I'm just I'm In charge here here we go ... no no it was OK okay fine I'll tell you what the\nFreedom and gross those are my two values\nAnd give me an example out of behavior that supports freedom\n[noise] um well\nFor me being out one thing yeah for its freedom I'm being a better listener on this program because if\nTo you and I can't monopolize discussion on my best days I Will do for less talking and former lifting um\nThose are two ways of freedom expresses themselves",
