television why she supports this legislation\nAnd how much have given up hope\nIdaho was one of four states that will vote on Medicaid expansion next month many people have expressed frustration at the federal government on health care and are looking to state governments for change and that is our focus for part three of our special series this state we're in a deep look at the bills and ballot initiatives dominating the debate in state capitals\nDozens of red and blue states have passed laws aimed at lowering prescription drug costs and addressing the opioid crisis many voters will also face ballot initiatives on ...\nNational correspondent for the hill read welcome back to what the heck they dress with we also welcome back Julie Rovner chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health news she's also the host of the podcast what the health\nAnd the author of health care policy and politics\nAid to the Julie thanks for making time for thanks for having me I feel like every time I say the name of that podcast I have to pronounce it really really carefully while he's the Alps you did it just strikes and Scott Greenberg or executive editor of state line which is a journalism project of the Pew Charitable trusts Scott welcome thank you so much\nJulie let me start with you and we'll start with Medicaid expansion we want to go through a bunch of different kinds of legislation over the course of this conversation\nBut we'll start with Medicaid first of all just give us the basic remind us what Medicaid expansion\nMe when the Affordable CARE Act was passed in twenty ten every state was supposed to expand Medicaid the idea was that for um middle income people there would be subsidies to help them buy private insurance\nAnd for lower income people and they extended that all the way up to a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty I'm about sixteen thousand dollars a year those people were supposed to get Medicaid for the first time you could get Medicaid if you just had a low income you didn't have to be\nI'm pregnant or a child or a senior citizen or someone with a disability a\nAnd it went to the Supreme Court in the Supreme Court to everybody's surprise that um this is going to be voluntary for the state states don't have to expand Medicaid will Congress had said that they weren't going to pay a hundred percent of the cost for the first three years and then going down only to Ninety percent for going forward\nFor this um population so for most states it was a no brainer you're basically getting free federal money to help people get health insurance and the blue states all jumped to expand and eventually some of the red states jumped to expand but we're now down to roughly a dozen and a half states that have not expand it\nThat's what we're looking at now and interestingly on the ballot in three very red states that didn't expand\nA voters are going to decide whether or not they're going to expand Medicaid\nSo Julie just be clear most states are currently participating mostly have expanded Medicaid has what they have read as Julie mentioned there are some states were voting on Medicaid expansion next month Idaho

conversation we would love your help with tomorrow's program on climate change today President Trump is serving the destruction from hurricane Michael he says he still skeptical on whether climate change is manmade he's not alone maybe you agree with him at least in part\nIf you are not one hundred percent convinced that\nStuff and how did you reached that conclusion leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a now on the other hand\nMaybe you are part of the vast majority of people who are one hundred percent convinced how have you won skeptics over or if you don't bother to argue climate change anymore\nWhy not tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a or you can leave us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our series the state we're in today we're looking at state trends in health care law's with Julie Rovner chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health news Scott Greenberger executive editor of state line and read Wilson national correspondent for the hill before we move on from Medicaid read\nI I did want to get your sense of kind of where this is going only one state Maine has approved Medicaid expansion through the ballot box so voters in Maine voted for expanding Medicaid but the governor of Maine Paul the page still refuses to do so\nHe talked about his opposition to expanding Medicaid during the morning talk show on W. V. O. M. radio back in July here's part of what Maine's governors said\nOne thing I Know there's no way they can force me to put state in red ink and I will not do that so I can tell them to go to jail before I put the ... the stage and read it and if that's the core tells me I have to do it then we're going to be going to jail\nAs part of Maine Governor ... speaking back in July now read ... telling voters I'd rather go to jail can kind of feel like he's telling voters to go to somewhere else but how much of his political feet or I mean how's this going to ask well\nA ... page is he was sort of Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump he uh he was the loud and and bombastic candidates in a one two races that are ah he probably shouldn't have one in the political Senate and that you know main is a pretty liberal state and\nI came in to shake up the old order and that's what voters elected in foreign\nUh now he is refusing to follow the will of the voters I'm In the Medicaid expansion will happen in Maine at some point ... just turned out this year or the Democratic candidate is leading in most of the surveys that ah that that up there um but it it has not happened yet and as a consequence Apollo pages actions\nThere are thousands of people in in Maine who [noise]\nThe problem in Maine especially in a communities that have been hard hit by things like climate change the the lobster community in the in the northwest part of the state along the northern coast or is it has been pretty devastated and they work for very low wages and pretty dangerous jobs and uh you would think that they would need that Medicaid expansion\nLet's shift gears and talk about the cost of prescription drugs and issue I think that everybody sooner or later have to grapple with dozens of states pass laws this year\nThe aim to get rid of this kind of gag rule it prohibits your pharmacist from discussing prescription drug prices with you we spoke to one democratic state lawmaker about isn't about why he introduced new legislation on prescription drug pricing\nI Am a representative Ryan Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island and I'm In my thirtieth year as a state representative\nSo earlier this year representative Kennedy had this sinus infection a mild infection his doctor prescribed an antibiotic Kennedy went to a pharmacist that he'd known for a long time and the pharmacist told him that he's he paid the retail price of the if you pay the retail price the drug and didn't pay with his insurance he would pay less\nWhen I went to my local pharmacist he told me I I Can't tell you that there might be another option for you that other option would have been not to use my co pay because the cost of the of the pills was so low it would have been cheaper for me to pay those out of pocket\nRepresentative Kennedy learned that the pharmacy had a contract with a company called a pharmacy benefit management company it handled its drug insurance plan that ... that prohibited the pharmacist from discussing this with customers\nKennedy and for their democratic state lawmakers decided to introduce legislation that would ban the so called gag clauses and the bill had not passed\nWe wanted to make sure that Rhode Island does have that opportunity to speak one on one with the air with the pharmacist in and learn what their their pricing options are because\nOf that is consistently one of the big complaint so we hear from our constituents on a on a regular basis is how expensive drug costs have become\nSo Scott Greenberg or we heard from representative Kennedy about what's going on in Rhode Island how common are laws like the one that he's pushing ... how many states have passed laws like this well\nBut it these gag causes are a pretty common and uh last year there were a over a dozen states that [noise] excuse me took up legislation or having to do with these got claws\nGag clauses this was kind of low hanging fruit though of a\nOf a drug drug prices issue a I don't think anyone like these gang clauses but uh\nYeah that that will be less federal legislation on these state bills won't change the fact that many many people struggled to pay for the prescriptions they need and um it's a very complicated issue and there are many states are taking other other steps to try to rein in prices\nShe mentioned the president's he signed two bills last week as you noted that were designed to lift these gang clauses on prescription drug prices here is part of what the president said\nIt's the no the lowest price active two thousand Eighteen and patient right to know drug prices that and\nObviously based in the name you can tell that just gives people knowledge as to prices have different locations where to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact too\nIt's called the law of supply and demand pretty simple but we didn't have that they didn't want to have that some people didn't want to have that but now we have it and it's going to really drive prices\nScott back up to the the bills that various states have signed on this California signed a few bills into law on this a few weeks ago governor Jerry Brown signed them and these are considered among the strongest there'll be laws in the country what do they do\nWell I think the what a lot of states are doing in California or as is often the case with this kind of progressive legislation is in is in the lead on this\nOn California is trying to reduce drug prices for transparency in other words they are are requiring um uh the drug companies to be public about a price increases increases beyond a certain point and the idea\nIs that uh if these are made public that they'll sort of be shamed into into reverse in some of these increases it's still too early to say though whether this is going to have the desired effect um nevertheless other states this year California passed its bill\nOr in two thousand Seventeen and last year you had five more states um Connecticut Maine New Hampshire Oregon and Vermont all passed a drug pricing laws that are similar\nTo California so we'll see whether transparency is enough to reduce prices and then in addition to that\nUm some states have tried to go even even further than that Massachusetts passed a bill that would've allowed a its Medicaid program to exclude some drugs from the a formula to the um [noise] uh the group of drugs that are available to Medicaid recipients and the idea was that\nExclude some FDA approved drugs and and as of right now Medicaid state Medicaid programs have to include all FDA approved drugs and their formula Larry the idea was that if they were able to exclude drugs that would give them leverage in negotiating on prices but uh the federal government shutdown that that effort by Massachusetts\nI Want to make sure understand the argument from Massachusetts what they were trying to do any damage to the federal government shut that down semesters has not do this now are now for an hour an hour now but the ... it sounds like you're saying the argument is you know find Massachusetts\nAnd you know Julius the drug company I could say hey Julie this medication that we know was FDA approved is still too expensive and we're not going to just pay blanket leave for a medication we think it's too expensive so you have to keep negotiating or we're not going to we're not going to honor that part of the\nExactly that's right I mean interestingly enough in this uh uh the federal government though it rejected a mass at the Massachusetts

installment of our special series the state we're in we'll focus on state trends in labor unions and collective bargaining public employee unions have been in the spotlight this year with teachers' strikes this spring and the Supreme Court decision this summer that affects collective bargaining\nHow was the labor movement doing in your state perhaps there are laws where you live that prevent people from organizing for better wages or working conditions or benefits tell us what's going on where you are leaves the voicemail eight five five\nTo three six one a one day we also know there are thousands of hotel workers on strike across the country\nHave you benefited from union membership or perhaps do you think that unions have too much power in your state tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a our series the state we're in continues next Monday on one day\nBack now to our conversation with read Wilson Julie Rovner and Scott Greenberg are still time to get in a few more of your questions and thoughts about state health care policy where you live one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nJulie let's get to that question for months in law who tweeted isn't part of the reason Medicaid expansion didn't get as good support\nIs that it wasn't available as quote unquote GAP insurance for those whose employer plan has a high deductible\nWell of course the people who have an employer plans with a high deductible\nOf dollars in deductible so you have to pay before your insurance kicks and there are a couple of small demonstration programs where Medicaid has been able to ah basically fell in with employer insurance but generally Medicaid and sort of an all or nothing proposition you're either on Medicaid or you're off\nThe way they Affordable Care act was created with those people up two hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get\n'em medicated people between a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty and two hundred and fifty percent of poverty get special discounts they don't have those big deductibles so it it and then over two hundred and fifty percent of poverty then you're sort of on your own\nI'm In Arkansas I might point out though another we've been talking about a lot of different program that they instituted was to help people who often who were right at that margin we're constantly shifting back and forth between Medicaid and private plant and basically what they would do is the state was allowed to basically buy them into the private plans that they wouldn't have to keep changing\nWhere two weeks sidebar for just a second let me to the point of the series is to talk about what states we're doing on big issues healthcare is a very big one it's one of the very first things that Donald Trump said he was going to act on when he became president repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act AK Obamacare\nThere are some people who feel like health care should be a national matter every human being in the United states of America should have equally good planned what simple set of health care costs and there are other Americans who believe it should be left up to the states that every state has different kinds of needs and different issues and the needs to be for ...\nAre we any closer to one side of this argument winning or is the state federal split just kind of baked into the nature of this country like where is this where is this going Julie\nActually it's where it's going it's back to where it was before the Affordable CARE Act what we're finding from all these sort of small incremental changes that the Trump Administration has done is that the the Affordable Care act was intended\nTo create more of a national floor if you will for health insurance states\nStill do an enormous amount of regulation of how can they always have the federal government has always been sort of the the junior partner to the states um but it had gotten so such a patchwork that it made huge differences which state you lived in what kind of healthcare you were able to get to the Affordable CARE Act with trying to say\nThere's a floor beneath which people won't fall that is slowly being chipped away and we're going sort of every month looking more and more like we did in two thousand nine before the Affordable CARE Act\nScott do you get the sense that this means that the effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is kind of succeeding than it is taking us back to where we were before him as well as Julie\nLike that they're re instituting some of the uh parts of the Affordable CARE Act that the Trump Administration has and the Republican Congress have tried to undercut so for example ah on the individual mandate the requirement that you have insurance um\nSo called association health plans which are these cheaper plans that do not a ... offer all of the benefits that were mandated under the AC a some states are saying well whatever they're doing the federal level um insurance is regulated at the state level and if you're going to sell insurance and our state you are going to abide by these rules\nI'll tell you one issue read that states and many people have been hoping the federal government will act on and it states kind of moved on anyway and that's dealing with medical marijuana it's on the ballot in some states again this year about twenty two states have already legalized pot for medical use some of legalize the recreational use\nVoters in Utah will choose whether to join the states or not and the political battle ground seems to have shifted and I want to read if you see it this way for more traditionally liberal states into more conservative areas over ...\nWell yeah and it's not just the medical of it has gone that way but also legalization of recreational marijuana the two states where legalization is going to be on the ballot this year is in Michigan in North Dakota\nA medic for no for ... for recreational low you know in in on the medical side there are three different amendments in Missouri which is nice and confusing for the voters out there to try to figure out\nWhich is which are and then that Utah is as you say on the ballot Oklahoma already approved it this year so yeah we're we're not talking about the liberal coastal elites that are legalizing marijuana ah we're talking about a red America that is now dealing with this debate or it came up and you know in Florida last year and\nLast last year two years ago but this is this is now a debate that I think it shows the shift in the political conversation around marijuana those sorts of people who approve of\nA marijuana legalization tend to be a older white males funny enough\nAnd then the millennial generation that the younger the basically the younger you are the more you in favor of\nA legalization you happen to be um the older white males the theory is that's the that's the sort of libertarian streak a they don't want the government regulating something that\nThey don't think the government has a hand in regulating and the real swing voters or perhaps not surprisingly come down to suburban women are in talking to the people who run campaigns for and against marijuana legalization\nBasically the battleground is mothers who are worried that their kids are going to be exposed to marijuana\nNot that this will not expand the market into younger people who will then have access to recreational marijuana and then you've got the opponents who say exactly the opposite that legalization will in fact\nUh begin to rope in a bunch of kids why are there are three items in Missouri they so they're all on the ballot from different ah proponents different sides of it with two of them are from a actual citizen groups that that put them on the ... amendment to an amendment three\nAnd then there's a proposition which I'd if perfect from around I think the proposition goes on the ballot from the state legislatures that's going to be some kind of\nCompromise or a piece that's proposition see 'em and they are all sort of competing\nWith each other and this underscores another piece of\nThe evolution of of marijuana politics pots of big business or in a lot of these states that have legalized Colorado Washington Oregon a California Nevada Alaska or Massachusetts and Maine are the people who are setting up\nA who get to write these laws also essentially get to determine who's in the market um and who owns a very lucrative space one of the biggest opponents\nOf recreational legalization in a bunch of early states where the people who ran medical marijuana shops because they already have the monopoly wide dilute the monopoly with other people\nI should know by the way we did a program this year about state laws on marijuana and the business of politics can find that on line at the one a dot org\nScott a couple of things to add to what to read said on this very interesting issue um at one is that it's sort of intersects with what we talked about earlier the opioid crisis because there are many people\nAre supporters of medical marijuana who argue that this is a viable alternative to uh to opioids for people who have chronic pain\nAnd then also I think we've written about this um it's interesting that social justice provisions are finding their way into marijuana bills or this idea that a\nA minority communities have been the most impacted by the war on drugs and therefore uh as we move towards legalization it makes sense to include in these bills provisions that uh\nThat ... on the one hand would allow people to ah to expunged they're criminal records for small amounts of marijuana but also some of these bills are calling for investment in these communities that we're most impacted and and also as I read said at the big business\nA step up for for people or were members of these communities so they can get into this very lucrative business\nLet's get to a few more trends before our time is up about ...
