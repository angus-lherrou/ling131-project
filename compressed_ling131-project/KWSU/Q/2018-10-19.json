Bo of applied economic research here in New Hampshire before we keep going and introduce our next guests I just want to kind of add a yes any men to what then you'll you just said\nWe're called how to earn six figures without a four year degree about how to get into some of the skilled trades\nThat requires some training or an apprenticeship but that don't require a four year bachelor's degree one of our guests are Nicholas when Louis Wyman who was the c._e._o. of the Institute\nFor workplace skills and innovation wrote a book called the job you and he put a question to answer on our website about what an apprenticeship is how does an apprenticeship work when should you consider taking one where do you go to find one you'll find all this information on our site program called how to earn six figures with out a four year degree\nOn line at the one a dot for that's the words are the number one the letter a dot org before we bring in our next two guests Russ one more thing about the job market here you mentioned\nThat New Hampshire has an aging population affordable housing is a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job market is adjust and aging job market or or does it manifest in other ways and that\nWell I think the main thing that is that we see right now is sort of they're lagging wage growth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to bringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year as sort of lagging\nThis prosperous economy that we hear so much about I think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs\nAnd I need three jobs go yet by so I think that that's a that's sort of the main stumbling block right now\nWe're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn kind of reverse course and started becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that they're in lies to crunch glad to get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management have been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nAnd Julian tweeted ... billion jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what ... my education and pay a third of what his manageable but try to zoom out\nAnd is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso here with this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome thank you Ryan can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture is\nWe've talked about New Hampshire are most states\nDoing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level\nSure what I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective to understand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity I start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands\nWage growth has also been quite weak\nAh and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places\nAre at the Hamilton Project we've released a paper recently that describes how over the last forty years geographic mobility has plummeted and those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places we\nAsked members of our one a tax club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at aged Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now as being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nI actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I liked that kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and\nThe store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nI think the same logic applies to the labor market fit in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity in the national data that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages\nAs employers compete for workers and we just having observed that overall real wage growth after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups outpacing other industries by big margins are for example ... wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy and I'd also say that wages are\nBut not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that's all they say that they were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page\nAs someone who works for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can see wages in the field aren't enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work was show emailed it's wages not supply and Christine car and wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote\nNew Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised there's we're at the national minimum wage thousands traveled to Massachusetts daily were the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you're dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor into structurally\n[noise] well I I don't have any empirical data on why so many uh employees are working in math and traveling there that I Know and I live there that they play it over half a million or can eaters everyday into the city and out\nUm and then many of those that coming from New Hampshire so you know wages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we have and to the jobs that are out there\nYou see the roots about shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\nThat you know I I feel like you know my point of view is I'm getting a set of a wider industry perspective in in the sense that I work in technology for the last ten years and\nComing to New Hampshire and looking at each of these high demand um occupation such as automotive construction\nManufacturing there just seems to be shortages across every single single sector whether it's in India factoring or in high tech\nLet's get through a few more of your comments particularly about the nature of will be described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed to all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stopped\nMuch experience plus we don't always want a huge salary\nJan in Manchester New Hampshire emailed I Know several educated and qualified older women who lost their jobs here in Manchester they've been out of work for at least six months I've overheard conversations at my local local supermarket from older employees losing hours to sixteen year olds ages them is a big problem\n... how do you see this that the impact of\nOf older workers especially in in high tech careers especially in like Silicon Valley\nIt's becoming worrisome at this point where if you're old we just decided we don't want you\nYeah I think that's that here in New Hampshire it's kind of like a to a degree that's less of a problem than it may be in Silicon valley for example because if you don't\nHire and retain older workers of chances are you're not going to get any workers because our our states as I said our median age is the second highest in the country so\nHere in New Hampshire I don't know that ages them per se as as big a factor as it might be in a more dynamic a state at one point in history was adding up close to two hundred thousand people a decade now we're barely staying even so\nP.

Rockefeller is working food health power jobs and resilient cities at rock sound dot org and from the listeners support this NPR station\nBy now to our conversation was ... and Ryan ... let me get to a few more of your comments before we bring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers\nChris writes as a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U.S has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties they want experienced people at relatively low wages right off the street\nIf you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left a voice mail in our inbox\nIs bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics in our house and supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months and we're really struggling with two items one is employed turnover where there\nAre chasing higher wages and and new facilities and new employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had the probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent from what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the rights\nSome were housing so easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us\nAnother one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade jobs shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in\nI Will withhold my thoughts on your abandoning your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because to stem their brain drain some cities and counties and states are offering to pay workers to move there there's a city in Nebraska that'll match signing bonuses for newcomers to the tune of five thousand dollars\nVermont to pass a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAn accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt that plan with the idea of Randy ... the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county\nAnd he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to win a thanks Joshua so this is called the come home award tell us what to come home award is how does that work\nYou gotta come home award program that we lost in ... and early twenties sixteen is really\nTurning traditional scholarship business miles on their head\nUm there are too many flaws and traditional scholarship to talk about and doing that but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model and instead of investing heavily in a Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college\nWe flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly upon completion of some kind of degree\nBut only if you return to our region to live and work as really aren't home home reward paying off of that\nSo this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair accounting\nYeah we have a very strong preference for those with family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that they have some family connection here there's probably a better bet they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county paint me a picture of what's it like\nA small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of Lake Huron in St Clair river um our largest town of course you're out has a population of about thirty thousand people we do not have a four year University in our region we did I have a fortune five hundred company in our region a thirty percent of our workforce\nUh the family friendly environment amenities a small town America Josh\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside of Detroit is that right\nYeah and you were talking about something earlier just don't want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is\nGreat for Detroit um but the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged on the economic health of regions like port Huron are Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true health\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people hit they're pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it hit here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come home program\nWas once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was philanthropies government business\nAny other sector we realize that we all had to get together and play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan\nIt had to be an organic plan that that drove our prosperity\nSo Randy telling me how to come home award works suppose I'm from saint Clair townie and I moved to Chicago for work and now I'm considering coming back and how does that work\nYeah Chicago's a great example Chicago Austin's south um as long as you do not have primary residence here so let let's say your parents still live in this region\nMaybe completed college six years ago and you're still living in Chicago but you met someone you met a partly the medicine if other you you're weighing the option of staying in Chicago which is a great place to live or you want to come back home settled down started family spend\nMore time doing what you want to do as long as you don't already live back in our region\nOr you're eligible for Fifteen thousand dollar award if you're selected we give the recipients a hundred and twenty days to establish a permanent residency or they have to find a job that they don't already have won several already have jobs lined up\nAnd then we stretch those payments out over two or three years as the carrot to keep you here and it's really a simple back scholarship we pay the loan holder directly which in every case for us has been the federal government\nSo I Do so you you pay it on a little bit overtime so by over time by the time to two years or up since\nLike would that be three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars like every six months or so and it adds up to Fifteen thousand over time\nThat's exactly it Josh when the goal you know I'm is to really give young people actually yeah it could be in their twenties or thirties or forties I'm the chance to go two or three years without making that\nNationally I Know you see data that says the average college student has thirty thousand dollars in debt I don't know where they're getting that data Josh because out of the fifty plus applications we've received\nOur average that an eighty thousand dollars\n[laughter] that that's a crippling amount of debt at preventing people from living the American dream\nI can relate to that I'd finally paid off my private student loans I had to settle them it was\nCaught it was it was the most awful form of financial slavery I can possibly imagine and yeah definitely like that's a whole other our where I Will I Will tell you with my tearful story of dealing with Sally Mae before I I Know rusty but wants to jumping but before he does Randy I just want to ask you about\nSome of the perception issues that we discuss with regards to New Hampshire\nThere's this there ... there is evidence that young people are moving to bigger cities in in large numbers\nYou have talked a lot about this feels kind of small town America New Hampshire specifically conquered for sure definitely feels like small town America\nDo you think there's this misperception about smaller communities that young people are getting I haven't seen the TV show\nThat kind of glorified young people in a small town since dawson's creek I mean you don't see it much any more to do you think people are just getting the wrong idea about living and working in smaller parts of the country that we're all just kind of dabble by the big city\nYou know that's that's a great point I was when I speak around the country about this program in this effort of talent attraction there is a complete misperception that young people don't want to move to small town America I'm One of the biggest impact of this programming is dispelling that met\nNo I'm not saying ten thousand young people a year law to move to a small town America New Hampshire or this part of Michigan but we've already had far more applications for this program that we can possibly find our region needs to realize there is a is a growing interest in coming to small town America they just happened to be out of our line of sight\nRight for people in my age so it's really just dying that meant New Hampshire has a lot to offer and there are young people that will move back home we have to be open the how do we make that transition happen\nRoughly one of the jumping yeah I was gonna say that traditionally in New Hampshire we lose twenty somethings", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Pullman", "day": "19"}
