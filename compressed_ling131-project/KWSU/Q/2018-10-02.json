state houses and governors are passing bills and voters are approving ballot initiatives today we're launching a special series called the state where in\nEach Monday This month we'll explore the bills and ballot initiatives dominating the debates in state capitals what are the state level trends tell us about the political direction of the country\nThis time around we'll explore trends in gun legislation and proposals around the nation today also marks one year since the mass shooting in Las Vegas at an open air country music festival it left fifty eight people dead and hundreds of people wounded\nAfter that shooting many people called for more gun control measures particularly on bump stocks some states passed bump stock restrictions other major restrictions went nowhere\nBut this year something shifted after another mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida a gunman walked into that school and killed Seventeen students and staff\nThat sparked a movement led by students survivors and states around the nation started restricting got access including some states with Republican governors\nJoining us in Studio to discussing is Scott Greenberg executive editor of state line a journalism project of the Pew Charitable trusts Scott welcome back to one day thanks very much for having me\nJoining us from NPR in New York is Chris Brown the president of the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence Chris welcome thank you so much and joining us from Texas Public radio in San Antonio is Richard Feldman the president of the independent

program we are eager to hear from Mr Oliver North thus far or in treaties have gone unanswered but that invitation still stands\nScott Greenberg let me start with you this has been a heck of a year for the gun control movement and also the gun rights movement in the U.S\nGive us the broad overview of what's been going on as I understand that there are about fifty new laws restricting gun access that move forward including and fourteen states that have Republican governors right\nThat's right and uh we tracked there since\nThe shooting in Parkland, Florida a last February because uh it what we found and this is really interesting was that up until Parkland even with uh the many other mass shootings unfortunately that have taken place\nA that for the most part states reacted by expanding gun rights I'm up until Parkland Parkland seems to have shifted something or perhaps a because the students there um\nBecame so politically active and so outspoken a so quickly or that following that um [noise] incident it seems that ah states have moved from the other direction as you noted\nThere have been about fifty new laws restricting access to guns ranging from a bump stock bands to allowing authorities to temporarily disarm\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the doors do charitable foundation whos clinical scientists development towards support promising early

trends this year in New state gun laws and proposals part one of our new series the state we're in we're speaking to Scott Greenberg or executive editor of state line Chris Brown the co president of the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence\nAnd Richard Feldman president of the independent firearm owners association Richard by the way before we keep going we mentioned that you are a former lobbyist for the n._r._a. you're not president of a group called the independent firearm owners association\nFor those who may not have heard of it that's that's a separate organization from NRA right or is it affiliated or is there any relationship not just clarify\nNo relationship between the two I headed up the firearm industry's trade association during the Nineteen nineties\nOkay thank you I just wanted to make sure we're kind of clear on on the the distinction between your organization and the and the n._r._a. Scott Greenberger I Wonder if we could talk a little bit more\nGoing four term governor of California just vetoed a bill that would have expanded that states red flag ball Jerry Brown is a Democrat the very progressive but also thoroughly pragmatic and has pushed back on Democrats in an array of ways so\nThis is an unprecedented in terms of human vetoing something the Democrats would have wanted but what do you make of the veto\nWell a ... you know California of course is a very blue state of progressive state and already had um a\nA relatively speaking a pretty strong gun control laws in place so I'm at the Jerry Brown has a governed as say a pragmatic a liberal and progressive and so um [noise] uh you know in this case he felt like it at perhaps you know with some of the concerns that ah Richard raise that uh\nIt went a little too too far um and a return note it's a question of of balance but I Would add also I think it's interesting that generally speaking\nA that a lot of the debate um post a Parkland has focused on a these so called red flag laws or I'm\nA limiting the gun access to guns for people a\nDomestic abusers you know the argument or the ... argument for for such a long time was that a guns don't kill people people kill people and it seems that now rather than trying to revive a for example on assault weapons ban uh the assault weapons ban from the nineties\nOr people who are in favor of more um\nUh safeguards gun control are pushing on red flag laws are they're pushing on background checks and it seems like that's a potential uh common ground between people who are\nA very strongly support their Second Amendment or what they view is their Second Amendment gun rights and and folks who would like a um some more ah controls and safeguards speaking\nOf the ... are a governor Larry Hogan of Maryland who's a Republican had an a minus rating from the national Rifle Association here he is endorsing a red flag law in February\nI've said for years um that we need to do more\nTo keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill and people with criminal backgrounds that's why we will push for and support what is known as red flag legislation in general this policy would allow family members for\nWhich would prohibit an individual from having any firearms ram a notion [noise] if the judge was clear evidence that the family member poses a animated and present danger um causing injury to themselves or to others [noise]\nIndividuals with a mental illness should not have access to fire them for\nThat is Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland worth noting that who's a minus rating from the un already dropped to be as a result of his support of these kinds of red flag laws Chris I Wonder what impact you think\nThat that kind of influence would have on more states passing these kinds of extreme risk laws\nI think it has a positive impact absolutely a and I think governor Hogan\nActually there are a he's doing the right thing and be you know he's a politician he has to be aware that that has an impact on his NRA rating it has an impact on the rating the Brady Gibson as well and I think it relates back to the initial point\nThat I made that is part post Parkland really there is a groundswell of activism on this issue a huge new slate of polls that had been taken\nWhich show in every state across this country\nA vast majority well over fifty percent normally in the seventies or supporting exactly these kinds of measures\nThey're sensible measures they're pragmatic measures and they balance appropriately uh the you know the second Amendment rights of of gun owners\nWest or the idea that we all want to be safe in our communities one of the most heartbreaking components of my job is getting polling data back and focus group information that really yields two different things and I think it's really important to think about these laws in this context first\nAmericans overall when they ask about their fear associated with being shot one of the most profound quotes I got back from a recent poll is well most people think I have not then shot yet\nAnd and that is a very concerning the second is many Americans are actually ashamed about the epidemic of gun violence in this country and they want pragmatic solutions so I certainly applaud governor Hogan for doing the right thing here\nAnd moving forward knowing that these are popular and populist positions to take\nI hear you Chris in terms of the pragmatic argument but you know when it comes to gun laws their constituents in their constituents I mean Vermont and the good example of that I mean Vermont was one of the states that band bump stocks as part of a larger package of legislation on guns is here back in April Vermont's governor Phil Scott who was a Republican who had an a rating from the n._r._a.\nSigned these laws into these bills into law\nGovernor Scott said he changed his mind about them after police\nFoiled an alleged shooter's plans to storm a local high school and basically kill as many people as possible now here is some of the sound from the signing ceremony as he was signing outside the Vermont state house he was being heckled\nBy opponents to gun restrictions listen\nI support the second amendment [noise]\nDoing everything we can make our kids in our community safe [noise]\nOur kids are afraid to go to school and parents are preying\nOr police don't have the tools they need to protect victims of violence or families can step in to prevent a loved one [noise]\nOf the signing ceremony on the steps of the Vermont state house with Vermont governor Phil Scott who is a Republican Richard Feldman Philbin when you hear that moment from the signing ceremony ... what does that tell you about the the nature of this debate in states across the country [noise]\nBut I think in many ways the pro gun community led by the national Rifle Association is somehow corner good self by its own success on the politics\nOf this issue transcends the policy of this issue and therein lies so much of the problem in getting this debate focused in a way that we can achieve results that work for everyone and\nWe can but not when we focus on the politics but only on the policy we really have to well wind those two and dealing with the perceptions versus the realities in this society\nIt's a statistical thing but of course it's going to make news and we're all I'm In the same boat when when we see things day in and day out we feel that gets all around us\nWe deal as human beings with these perceptions um for so long now um when the pro gun rights community has gone after something they've often gotten their way so you end up getting cornered by your own success um\nDeshon working to

quality audio file and to keep up to date on future topics will share some of your stories next Monday when our series the state or in continues here on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Richard Feldman Chris Brown and Scott Greenberg or a few more different kinds of laws that we should touch on before our time is up\nWe should talk about the minimum age is to purchasing long guns and rifles four states California Hawaii Illinois and Florida passed new laws that would raise the minimum age from Eighteen to Twenty one uh Florida State representative who ... who was a Republican\nSponsored new legislation on new gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida he had an eighth grade from the n._r._a.\nSerious speaking on WFL our TV in Miami about why he agreed to raise the legal age this is an edited version of his interview\nA determining what age someone can do something is a judgment call and we do it in in many areas of our of our law making and so I think it was for that on was the fact that you had an Eighteen year old a who did purchased this weapon I think I think without that partake in fact he probably wouldn't have seen that [noise]\nWhat about law abiding Floridians who are Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old some of whom have gone and served our country and fought for our country overseas what are you say to those who feel like their Second Amendment rights are being British particularly that group\nOr if you're a law enforcement officer or or you served in the military society has already said that you're trained and can carry a firearm till this bill would not in favor of that even if those are just\nThat's the ... in Florida Republican state rep speaking to us for TV in Miami Chris I Wonder how you think it will play out with this law particularly because the n._r._a. is challenging it in court\nYes than our as challenging it in court I think a Marion Hammer has done a very effective lobbyists there for the n._r._a. for a long time um had a suit filed within twenty four hours of that measure passing\nI think that it will certainly withstand judicial scrutiny from our review 'em and be upheld and I think it's a natural reaction to the a mass shooting involving you know that are often\nUm with schools individuals who are within that timeframe of Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will note that Florida passed a package of laws at the minimum age being one all of which were\nA really designed to address the the type of issues that we saw\nA from Parkland at the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in the home where he stayed on secured\nAnd that's why the extreme risk laws so important so we're seeing these kinds of package bills ah reviewed and introduced that the most notable point for me is it passed in the state of Florida\nHas long been one of the strongest a sort of ... of the enterprise legislative agenda and I think is very telling on obviously the reactions of Parkland and the the activism\nThat took place immediately following a the Parkland shooting\nWould like to come back to safe storage and the moment but there were ... by the way we did a program when we visited Salt Lake city\nAbout guns in the mountain west states and and the nature of gun suicide in the mountain west in which a state representative who joined us showed us want to be safe storage lockers that does open with your fingerprints I tried it it it works it's it's pretty fascinating you can find the conversation on line at our website the one a dot org\nBefore we move on to other kinds of gun legislation Richard Feldman could I just get your sense in terms of\nThe ... real view on gun legislation\nThe administration's authority on a federal level rather than the state level\nOr we just kidding ourselves here should we just come out and just say the n._r._a. is not in favor of any new gun legislation that can be passed on a bipartisan basis are we trying to make the n._r._a. more ten fifth wheel and more collaborative than it really is\nWell first of all it's to find something I'm always a little bit of a loss to understand when people talk about the n._r._a. on an endowment number the n._r._a.\nThere five million NRA members um there's the board of directors that has the senior leadership there that can psalms there are many and our race\nThere's my uncle was a card carrying life member of the at Iraq and we'll show you his card on demand if you ask with great pride\nAs so many will myself included um but I I I think we're talking about the senior leadership of an already here and um again when I said earlier an array finds itself institutionally boxed in a corner\nOf if you're calling it gun control no matter what it is it could mandate\nThat when you turned Twenty one you're given a gun they're almost institutionally has to be against it because of the terminology in the political position of the terms\nGun control they don't mean that we sometimes think they mean are they mean different things to different people at different times but\nYou know what I mean I'm Talking about Wayne LaPierre Oliver North of the leadership of the national Rifle Association what we hear you know from the big ... the main figures who speak with a national voice for the n._r._a. it's the\nYou know the only thing that stops a bad guy with the gun is a good guy with a gun it's those ads within the last to say you know they are coming for our freedom and they use their media and the n._r._a. as you know ... you know liberties last safe place that in RA that's who I'm Talking about\nWhat you're talking about that's politics that's galvanizing the true believers\nThat's about membership that's about fundraising that's about a organizing for the next a political event both sides to it and there's nothing unusual about that whether we're talking firearms or the environment\nOr any other hot button issues in America everybody does\nWell we've been put on that side Scott Y. disorder sides I wanted to ah just ah to to add to that that you've seen on some of those issues issues you just mentioned and perhaps uh we're going to begin to see it on gun control as well that in cases where\nState legislatures are gridlocked and the power of a [noise]\nUm the gun lobby is such that uh that lawmakers won't pass anything I'm a there is another outlet in many states and that's about initiative Washington state will have a ballot initiative in November that would raise the minimum age to buy a a\nSemi automatic rifle to Twenty one uh Oregon people in Oregon and supportive a similar measure came close to getting out on the ballot so we may see that I mean that's that was a pattern with marijuana legalization for example so that that might be a that might be coming in the future\nLet me get to a few more of your calls and comments we did get a call about speed gun legislation in Missouri from a person who was working for a democratic state reps office this is what she lifted our inbox\nThis is Emily Laughlin calling from Missouri state representative Tracy me curries office in two thousand sixteen Missouri has ... six fifty six eliminating all permanent requirements for concealing carry in the state of Missouri leaving a loophole that allows domestic abusers to possess firearms\nSince two thousand sixteen there's been a bipartisan effort to close that Paul\nLeadership and the Missouri legislature will not new this\nBill or make it a priority to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers instead during the past session we spend our committee time focusing on bills that expand gun rights like house don't Nineteen thirty six known as the guns everywhere bell that little lemonade almost all of the state's gun free zones thanks for your doing on money\nThanks for calling in Emily and sharing your story with as much appreciated Carol in Fairlawn, Ohio emailed\nNot only has a Republican legislature not
