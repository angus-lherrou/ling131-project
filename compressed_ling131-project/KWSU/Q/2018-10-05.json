are states we have for justice having goes to list the fridges are regulatory shows with\nExplained in detail there by the network news now fast forward to election night\nEver seen advertised by CNN right now is moving our earlier decoration of Florida\nThrough a very close calls call off\nNow that's the night that red and blue clashed into their current meetings then I went Florida was blue than it was too close to call and it was read then I'm known\nThen the ... started to hang and then Bush Gore you might remember that it's also the night according to my guest Steve ... when our increasingly divisive politics came to a head\nAnd established America's polarized identity as the red and the blue and in fact that is the name of his new book they're reading the blue the Nineteen nineties and the birth of political tribalism\nSteve ... is the author he's MSNBC and NBC News national political correspondent\nAnd he's in the studio with me Steve it's a pleasure to have you it's great to be here things have me I'm Steve we're gonna talk a lot about fascinating political history we're also going to talk about where we are now in our politics or our electoral politics to house the Senate the Kavanaugh hearings which have captivated American undercurrents of the politics there\nBut let's go back to two thousand because we just took it did yeah into those memories of hanging chads and Bush Gore and the recount in Florida and the Supreme Court deciding the results of an election\nUm that's where your book begins and also where it ends why was that such a pivotal moment for political ideology America yeah no I mean I I think it's the two thousand election to me which is you as close to a perfect I think we're ever going to see in a presidential election\nUm it was the perfect combination of the nineties all of the political wars of Nineteen nineties Bill Clinton Newt Gingrich Hillary care Ross Perot pitchforks Pat Buchanan impeachment all of these these major battle these major forces\nThat shape politics created this division that when you looked at that map on election night two thousand and you saw the entire south was now painted red red for Republicans the entire northeast minus New Hampshire barely\nA was painted blue for Democrats the Pacific coast you could see these\nThe stark geographic boundaries and they were more than geographic they were they were cultural boundaries they were demographic boundaries\nAnd I think the nineties really to me it's the decades those colors sync up with the parties those colors took on a partisan meaning political meaning and people chose sides and it's almost ... two tribes were formed red and blue and and I think that framework that was ...\nEver since and at that time red and blue working

you know the budget that we're in for you have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are\nDead men walking as far as [noise] back in twenty\nTwelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quip Timmy and any reporters would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough to survive as a Republican Party in the future meeting Republicans\nHad to broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics flash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it anymore\nStunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham hocus vacation in the Trump here it said to you about where we were in\nIn in where we are yeah I mean it tells me that the divide is deepening any idea tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to you that you saw in the two thousand election and I say that we've lived with a sense\nThey're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there and twenty twelve after twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally look to the Mitt Romney's last a brac Obama included what you know what Lindsey Graham did the demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just that he won the general election and that's a huge part of it but the fact that he was able\nTo sweep through the Republican Party is like other primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen told Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixteen one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump\nOf dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand granted our than granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of his party so what is Lindsey Graham thinking now it's\nAnd that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator from one more term or is he is he converted what's he think yeah I mean look there's and there's all sorts of theories about this I don't know to give you a couple of them that that that that jumped out at me what is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his enduring popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons\nTo Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk if you are seen as separating yourself from this president your next primary especially if you're Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being\nA being antagonistic towards the right here and they are so grim has to worry about that there is also the theory that hey part of this is\nLindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises or if you change your tone on Trump the way he has a golf with him maybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons is to is it is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump than twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road and then seeing down from when the election and I know it was narrow but seeing the one\nI think ... Lindsey Graham and just ... more broadly tells Republicans\nThat this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was\nAnd it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically\nKennan last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guy fast enough we can't manufacture them fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if\nWhen he closed his eyes at night whether he's changed his mind about that or not\nJames sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often\nSeveral of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and and Steve you're not him because that does not sound surprising to you\nWell what he's describing his ticket splitting yet to be and political science they those voters who go and they a Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot\nJust election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and in that that is just the rise of polarization of tribalism let's get back in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve ... so much of what your books\nFor this book although although he certainly could have a when he was a young rabble rousing congressman who was willing to defy the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house to then time speaker from Massachusetts the legendary Tip O'Neill\nMy partner speaker as you pointed out to us again yesterday are in charge of the house\nIf you are saying to me the urine postmaster isn't capable of delivering from one member to another the male and the system you run\nThen I think you may want to appoint a commission to look into the post office\nNow maybe a veiled insult there that might take a little bit of parsing but give it a back story and why Newt Gingrich was slinging an insult at a well respected and legendary Tip O'Neill\nYeah that that in in hindsight now you look back Thirty years and you play it you may say what what was the big deal the deal was Democrats had run the Congress at that point for Thirty years\nThey were seen as the permanent majority I mean Republicans weren't just the minority party they were buried deep they weren't even close you didn't go into an election saying maybe the Republicans will get it maybe they won't it was like maybe they'll get to a hundred Seventy feet you know that that was how deep in the minority they were in here with Gingrich um who was in his third term from Georgia\nBeating the speaker of the house she was at that point a Seventy two year old old school Boston politician Tip O'Neill man of the house\nBeating him into a fight on the floor of the house of Neal actually left the speakers rose from came down to the floor of the house to to debate Gingrich and and we have that very sound here's Tip O'Neill and his response\nFind out more at N.

story eight five five to three six one a one a that's eight five five to three six one two one two will make sure to get your stories on the air part of the national conversation in the days ahead here on one a\nWhile we're talking for the most part about what politician said and did in the Nineteen Ninety so how do they define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington that's polarized we've been asking listeners for memorable moments from politics in the nineties and and here's one\nAnd the president is right in many ways we are a shining city on it [noise]\nBut the hard truth is but not everyone is sharing and the city's splendor and glory there is this fair Mr President and the faces that you don't see in the places that you don't visit\nAnd your shining city\nAnd believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from ... the early nineties\nI take you back towards [noise]\n\n\nTo be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety two on the earth\nOn night time talk shows at all so that was something new talking about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because of the president appeared on Arsenio Hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark\nVery serious and and a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nWas also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second in third place in the presidential race at that point first Ross Perot begging place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton in so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two\nHad was thought to be unelectable he'd gone through the scandal about Jennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment it's sort of hard in this image of slick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer Li try this scheme is way out of\nA out of everything and so they were trying his campaign was\nTo change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around interviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers and the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall\nWhich was very hot at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd it was Ninety two it wasn't just are sending in Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot\nWho was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began in February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King Laurie can and and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was on in February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states\nI'll run for president an independent\nIn just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteers submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows Clinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary ...\nYou know aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did the person you're also that night well we won't be doing anything like that\nIn our city hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that when one after that was beneath the presidency yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not\nThat's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign to Bush wasn't doing our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message\nUm\nNow managed media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality Brock Obama had\nA winning personality an affable nice guy and used it to great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon to Stephen cold there there isn't a show that Iraq Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than than maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public has\nChanged just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or sending our home and I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier\nAnd the rise of Gingrich net moment with O'Neill what that moment came from with Gingrich looking for a way around with at the time where the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he CSPAN\nGive CSPAN was five years old in the early Nineteen eighties and he used the late night speeches and CSPAN to seek out find and develop a relationship with a new audience draw a line from that and how Gingrich is legal to build his career his rise in the house around that\nFast forward to Donald Trump or did Donald Trump to\nTelevision obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter\nDonald Trump identified through Twitter away to go around not just the news media but the entertainment media is well does that so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties with C SPAN in Trump was doing with Twitter\nAnd and I think there's a real common thread there well let's go back then in the way way back machine one more time\nTo Nineteen Ninety nine Donald Trump was people forget was involved with politics\nPress back in Nineteen Ninety nine and had some thoughts about somebody that we've already talked about Pat Buchanan the insurgent right wing politician in the Republican Party\nFor his Hitler lover I guess he's an anti satellite\nHe doesn't like the blacks who doesn't like the gays I I it's just incredible that anybody can embrace this guy and maybe I'll get four or five percent of the vote and it'll be a really staunch right wacko votes I'm not even sure if it's right it's just a lack of them and I just can't imagine that anybody can take him seriously", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Pullman", "day": "05"}
