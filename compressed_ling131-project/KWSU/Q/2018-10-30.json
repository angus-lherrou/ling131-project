weddings and uh it is\nI call home and especially considering that another few blocks from the synagogue\nWas Mr Rogers home I literally grew up in Mr Roger's neighborhood was even on his show when I was little and yeah well they got that tape somebody judgment\nBut um it you know this is a community that although it is predominantly Jewish are culturally Jewish is incredibly welcoming tolerant diverse you know really welcome all comers and it it is a place where\nUm you know one of the some of the popular um\nUh you know Jewish Delhi's growing up or rode a bagel nauseous and some of those have been replaced by Chinese restaurants and Vietnamese and Thai restaurants it's an incredibly includes of welcoming and loving community\nAnd the idea of this happening there at a place where the

speaking to in the ... went on Washington columnist for the Boston Globe rabbi Jill Jacobs the executive director of trucks and ... from buzzfeed news apologies to those of you who are trying to call it on the line and we've been getting deluged with phone calls [noise]\nSome of which we've had to screen out very quickly that we're going to do our best to put some of the most useful and positive and productive calls on the air\nTo those of you who've been making that job a little bit harder I think it might be worth sharing a comment from Alexander who emailed I have a message for those who hold this kind of hate in their hearts I don't care who you are I don't care what race you are a part of what creed you follow who you voted foreign twenty sixteen I Will find you\nCharlie ... let's get back to Thomas comments on Facebook Tommy rights\nWhen speeches free and in the open people get pushed back when it is driven underground it is giving legitimacy\nAnd leads to action one of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident what what can you tell us about gab\nAnd the kind of online footprint that Robert Bowers had there so\nUh ... dot com is a sort of a basically a Twitter cologne um and it is was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racists bigots [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter\nFor for violating Twitter's community standards are\nAnd gab was sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know eat the absolute power of a free speech but what ended up happening with gab is at it it became a cesspool it became a place where only these sort of worst people would go to express ideas that\nAre that we're really not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I ... it it has become a\nA place where white nationalism a and an extreme or bigotry homophobia whatever a has a has been embraced and and uh and this was a place where the the Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say his name\nOr was it maybe not radicalized necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his I truly hateful views it was the last place where he\nPosted before at the shooting 'em and it seems that it was it was sort of a\nA A N unproductive event for a lot of that hatred I'm an after after um after it was clear that the shooter had been an active a participant on gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming and realizing this for the first time\nA note notice that ah that that this place is you know a dark place to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying ah words are not bullets and social media posts I have a body count at zero sort of saying that you know this free speech is different from from action\nI started when they did they actually say words are not bullets anyone who said that should go read the declaration of independence when it you know what\nFree speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is that it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\nDevalue speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences than than there is sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why protected so hard is it means nothing um and and I think that that is something that that a lot of people don't quite grapple with especially on the Internet\nRub I ... I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like ... job is not the only place where this kind of speech politic rates on line it is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment First Amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful mask vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes curtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given a new kind of\nSpeed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened in Pittsburgh all the more worrisome to folks like you\nShort well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true it said how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it is true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to be such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the last where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate\nOn the right against Jews against\nCrucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported nimble than from the very top when the president at the United states that the white nationalists see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the left who is in charge we have somebody on the right who is the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist the racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign ad before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and light Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power and the United states of course trap the tap into\nVery old anti Semitic tropes ...\nYeah I I'm Sorry where do you want to get a little deeper into that a lot of thought a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts at that on that I mean the president\nDid address this during the speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday he began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil of anti Semitism\nAnd every other forms of evil and unfortunately the vote comes in many forms and we come together as one American people\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning she wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country cause in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly\nThat will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must end unquote\nGotten a number of comments from some of you about the president's potential role in all of this Susan is in Silver Spring Maryland right outside D.C Susan writes I look forward to the day when we once again have a president\nIndira well this was of course incredibly disturbing to have the president once again demonizing the press and calling us enemies of the people\nI'm going to be under the tree and we the people I mean this is this absolutely journalists are essentially in a way the life blood of a democracy if we're not able to inform and educate citizen I'm about what's going on in their country if we're not able to hold publicly elected officials accountable\nUm then you don't have a true democracy and the president misunderstand what the term fake news mean fake news actually means misinformation false stories that are made up\nSupport for

need or at NPR dot org slash won a back now to our conversation\nWith rabbi Jill Jacobs Charlie wars and an ... let's get some more of your questions and comments Constance in Silver Spring Maryland writes I Know this sounds weird but I actually feel some hope after the massacre\nIt was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in tears we were told it was just trumping Trump's telling it like it is he could be as prejudiced and root as he liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nAsia W tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially acceptable behavior we can fight back against hate speech with our own words are votes and our money\nAce in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions\nThere needs to be a consistent strong resistance to the hateful devices speech that is anti American journalists needs to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism the president's ignorant rents if not you who make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to scream very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments\nDC Hey David what's on your mind\nWell thanks so much for having the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who is both religious Jewish and also very much scientific I think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left\nOf people who have a strong religious views and close next to the state of Israel I mean I teach at a a small through school here in the city and or in this in the suburbs and a lot of her students do feel uncomfortable on college campuses and feel that um\nYou know if they express a strong and here in state of Israel or express religious views that aren't um you know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up in and how you were high school deals with it\nWell I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know we\nI mean there are students who are you know are not particularly\nStrongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leave this school\nAnd they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a friendly if if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't\nThink it's reasonable say that you're seeing a lot of violence from the left and that that's true I think you are saying and I think our students feel a certain intolerance 'em when they go to college\nUm and it's you know I don't know we we tell we do tell kids probably should need need to shut up you know\nAnd I haven't fished shut up that you know you can't argue with every class or just kind of how you're going to have to learn to live with that she kind of pick your battles I think that's a hard thing\nYeah to pick their battles I mean I don't I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advice didn't do that and not\nThe not settle everything well David the time but can be it can be very hard\nTo even let me put that to thank you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs right but what do you make of Davis comment\nThank you David I wanted to respond birth to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I went to saint Anthony first time really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course at high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you let it be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism in Alaska and very often it expresses itself as attacks on Israel and Israel is right\nCountries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses the line into anti Semitism [noise]\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of Israel's governmental policies we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies but rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out\nWho carry of violent acts and say that they're motivated by hatred of Israel but the targets are actually choose who are shopping in a grocery store in a jewelry store and I synagogue\nAnd at the same time and the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred\nA base racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is that it's being supported by the government it would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore\nWho's ... who is criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U. S. that instead we have somebody at the very top who is encouraging the hatred on the right and riling up his people\nMake it through a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation which has many recalls we can't as well Stacy wrote on our Facebook page\nI Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue to escape the news of the week now there is no escape and no sanctuary but as our nation rabbi features the world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid\nLynn wrote on our Facebook page yesterday's interface service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope\nVarious religious leaders offered support strings and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything is going to change we citizens must make it happen last night's fellowship help to bind our wounds and set us on the path for making our town better endure would you react to that I feel like part of what worked\nCommunity that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had someone crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to lock arms with one another\nThat's right I mean scroll hill is a very ... this is one factor is a very educated community\nUm it's right next to CMU Carnegie Mellon University in pet and a lot of the people who live in squirrel hill are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers account dentist it's an educated community a tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall\nIs also um you know politically liberal community and voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton in this last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community of Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill ... has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of\nThe city so that's why I Would say yes it did help in Pittsburgh favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming um we were talking about the ending the enemy of the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning\nI'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta just four months ago an attacker killed five reporters and Annapolis newsroom the capital gets that\nSo you know I Do think we have to worry about drawing the line um I mean meaning there is a line between hateful rhetoric and I'm hateful actions because of group polarization that happened\n... wouldn't deer just mentioned CNN is reporting that a suspicious package that was addressed the CNN was intercepted at a post office in Atlanta let's get to a few more of your calls and comments including one from Pittsburgh where Lee is on the line highly what's on your mind\nOr judge or a ...\nSure what what's on your mind how ... how are your neighbors doing after all this\nTime very upset it's you know it's it's it's devastating of a family of friends and customers in there and the living squirrel hill it's um we're taking a brutal hit 'em but like my comment is is that I think", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Pullman", "day": "30"}
