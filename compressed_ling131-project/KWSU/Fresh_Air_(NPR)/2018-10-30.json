Jonah Hill we'll hear that tomorrow today we're going to talk about how ... views echo the rhetoric of the white nationalist movement\nAnd about the threat that this movement posing my guess fast and I was a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author as uh\nDerek father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an Arab parents in the movement but here we know is racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties in a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Jared black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with Sasha ... this morning\nSessler welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing you back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the center God I thought about your book\n... black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black\nIs still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull a trigger at the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that but do you find non blacks story relevant to the views that were expressed by the shooter Robert Bowers\nI think you can draw a straight line from Don's views and ... work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter um you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooter spot he had a tattoo at fourteen eighty eight am to white nationalist slogans fourteen refers to a fourteen word\nSort of statement of purpose that is central to what storm front does about securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children at you know in and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and and watch my people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case then when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language in the motivation that exist on strong front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this a quote unquote race war that they believe is underway\nYeah the um uh ... had had said that um he believed the Jews were committing genocide against his people genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believed the Jews are committing genocide\nDo and both Don and Derek worst central to the sort of creation of that language even a term genocide that was one of the main things that Derrick and Don\nTried to spread and popularized on the radio show and and the idea behind it was it instead of speaking about uh you know minorities and slurs or things like that that they could appeal to white people by the idea that their race was slowly disappearing and more than that that this was a genocide that somebody else\nIt had huge purchasing this movement um and now white genocide I Would say is probably at the top of the paradigm of white nationalist ideas\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting and synagogue\nI'm In ... is the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the sound your son so so what are you reading on during from now\nAre some really vital um sort of celebration of what happens ah there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storm front over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that well\nThis probably isn't quite the way to go about it he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but\nThe people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global is and choose who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect but every now and then somebody's going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so have you spoken with either done are guaranteed black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular and you know and and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways culpable and he wanders and you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism plays into\nIncidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide into to popular icing on the movement so to have somebody go into a synagogue and murder eleven people\nAnd leave that building staying the phrase that you yourself spread again and again on the radio and for years and you're young wife is a I think it's it's haunting\nYou liked sass no is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Darren lack a former white nationalist whose father Don black sounded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm from\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Darren black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is ... it's\nA dark reality then I don't know what you mean America hadn't hadn't been any when we came nightmare than something like that would be possible\nVigil are being held across the country for the victims of the mass shooting in Pittsburgh how much is a national climate of even division responsible\nWords matter in rhetoric in this climate of bigoted rhetoric matters on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News starting at five here on northwest Public Broadcasting's NPR News service\nJust as fresh air to social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed\nWe're going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Derrick black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we now sing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nDerek father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nDerek Black and the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter ... who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included fast so the first question was addressed to dark black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning like people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we're better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs like my dad popular everywhere and white nationalism in so that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was far as it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and now that was\nNot about superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know the early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism what did they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable\nOr whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism [noise]\nReally did believe they were not doing bad things to other people that\nThe uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and maybe unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America\nLanguage and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to give people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confident way\nIn central is everybody is basically all white people are basically racist they're just afraid to express it so let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo that they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward they lay the Clintons to word [noise] um\nRacial s racial out all over the years if you look at the language in terms of how many people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies movement of people who are actively pursuing in and cause of separating and\nYou know races into into different homeland Sam White supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is\nSo if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguished movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures your based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black a

reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and it raises a nebulous thing fits that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nA really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public er and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those with how are we going to define who's white because only a white person could be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me a definition and even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and were something else starts and everybody was\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually white by most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white

was twenty to his father Don black as a former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter Eli sass low the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred\nSo they're one of the things you did you had been home schooled so you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views\nUm but then you went to college and from the way you described it in the book it was a pretty liberal college in Florida they were Jewish people their initial he tried to hide your identity\nWith an article by you in a gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's Derek Black so after you kind of out of yourself\nAnd after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when I found out who you really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to you even had a girlfriend ... additional you didn't initially no\nWas Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends\nSaid to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nBut I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew Shabaab dinners took the strategy that I think was very very smart\nOf ... are not talking to me about it uh I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up ... every other thing that we were possibly interested in did\nUm and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or talk about his life and this is very human\nAnd he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where either this is this is crazy we need to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of Derek transformation I mean I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on campus to invest in them\nCivil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast staring out and made it clear to him how how awful and how hateful and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah\nWho won one his trust filter relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through and and ah\nAnd showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited Derek over a week after week after week not to build a case against him\nBut to build their relationship hoping that just by spending more and more time with them and he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people and to the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself could be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick headset Matthew in ... in between these dinners which sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site\nAnd they would see the horrible things that he said about you and and what kind of yeah\nJews were on their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and you know in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid of beliefs\nJews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe the Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and I\nAre sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist would define as the white race and\nSo ... had also in their own lives experienced large degrees of anti Semitism in ... case he's a from a family of Hungarian Jews there was all but wiped out by the Holocaust that in Bergen do and and that was the definitive experience of his\nYoung life was growing up in an orthodox community that was largely defined by a by by an an incredible history of anti Semitism and and the Holocaust and\n... had had gone and traveled to these concentration

vote there about issues in your community there about do you listen to all things considered and hear the bigger picture every afternoon from NPR News\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's known for starring in movies like Superbad money ball and the wolf of Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting then would you be willing\nTo share a story line or a joke from one of your early scratch\nHere's what I say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah\nLet's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter of certain [laughter] but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age because my dad's favorite movie and\nI wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten and then I think is a I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the characters in The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old\n[laughter] who\nMarge was Don Corleone [laughter] because at a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the Don\nNo excuse me she's Michael Sallah OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael way to Homer fan\nNo Homer see that would be but I Would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a\nK [laughter] like Congress Diane Keaton like [laughter] what are you going to go legit you know [laughter]\nBut uh Lenny and Carl homers friends from work were Lenny was frayed auto and Carl was sunny and I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the um fishing or the or\nOr even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who tend to think\nOf that story and Catherine\nOn your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much I'll tell you story that I I find interesting because [noise]\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film like I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine the on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this I mean most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise]\nUm they said we are so mean you you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange well kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your money\nAnd it's the seminal movie in my life kids with a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids where kids it's so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burn in the world down\nAnd this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope even if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my missions the both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it um a friend of mine who ice skate boarding with who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York\nI completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older than I understood\nThe HIV aids plot and part of the film couldn't win over my head so I just took wow this is diversity of and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] disturbed and I need to talk to [laughter] like\nYou know like a laughing I Want to do is tell them that I just obey them but I was too shook up not to speak to them about what I had seen what shape you also about them\nI think the rape and ultra violence was just too of course it was too heavy so so hard to watch it\nLike you should listen to us because we're telling you that that's the reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realized they were trying their best\nI think ultimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nI guess this Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in their mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd marine card in will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American

and I worked for you [noise]\n\nAnd he quit his job which I thought it was a little weird I mean I just met this\nI don't get out of a ... there were other things about him to like a Fox for wrestling white T life I got to deal with your wife back then he was born rooms with clear when you just look more wash\n[laughter] okay so that's a theme of Leonardo DiCaprio and my guess Jonah Hill from the wolf of Wall Street um what did you learn from working with Martin Scorsese Arnold philosophy\nIs going to see so many things I guess the main lesson I learned\nWas that it's okay not to judge your characters to just show their behavior as people and the characters in his films often do really ugly things and you still find humanity\nIn there and I like how unabashedly\nAnd unapologetically he shows human being\nWhich is I think something that really\nSpeaks to me in art in general and something I'm going to strive for do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and something that I tried to do in mid nineties\nIf we don't want to leave it back to The Simpsons I mean homework I view it as a terrible father right about the terrible father [laughter] you can't be viewed but he also in really loving big hearted person right so you know it's like I guess I'm interested in the gray area okay\nSo this weekend this Saturday you going to host Saturday Night live November third\nSo I'm going to play an excerpt of a Saturday Night live sketch that you when you hosted in twenty fourteen and it's the sketch that most took me by surprise and when I say me I mean me personally the you played a six year old who's with step mother\nAt a ... hunter restaurant seated at a communal table and you're you're acting like this like six year old insult comic with all the insult directed at your stepmother Dr Debbie Wasserstein has played by Vanessa bear and she's trying to make you stop [noise]\nInappropriate inappropriate you must be all over my nightmares will take place in Syria and Terry Gross [laughter]\nMaybe you don't want to let me one of the time [noise]\nOkay [laughter] I was shocked and delighted already named ... a year on the show [laughter]\nThere's so many layers to why that is humorous to be here at this moment\nI was just so funny um I think the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like\nHe like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that you have to listen to NPR it's incredibly boring theory kid even though he's so aware to talk about the show with such detail\nAnd understanding but that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first I'm this is my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was probably like twenty three or something [noise] um [noise]\nAnd I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader and Andy Sandberg and I think a key ... oh Seth Meyers was there and uh\nWe couldn't tell whether the kid was like sticks or like forty [laughter] and when the when the chef did his trick the kid leaned back in ... one hand against the table almost like Tony Soprano style I think I just started\nDoing the kid is if you were like an old Catskills comedian and then that's where when I got there a few weeks later we were like oh we should try that as a sketch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times\nWell known health thank you so much for coming on the show it's been great to talk with you\nThank you to Jonah Hill wrote and directed the new film mid nineties\nAfter we take a short break marine card in will review
