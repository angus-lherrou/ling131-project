S. U.\nAnd we need new leadership in Congress right now\nAnd in eastern Washington because sadly after fourteen years my opponent is increasingly out of touch with what really matters to us instead of running on her record she's running away from her record on health care and putting her party's needs above our\nCongress has broken right now\nThe leader of a Congress that has blown a huge hole in the budget not dealt with health care or immigration and even left town without a farm bill we can do better\nI Want to go to Congress and work with are farmers veterans students seniors and defend our health care\nUm work for solutions not just talking points eastern Washington deserves an advocate that has more ah for\nAh getting things done than simply standing up for party priorities it would be an honor for me to serve you in Congress and I'm asking for your vote this evening\nThank you [noise] we began our debate tonight with the economy but us it's currently experiencing robot economic growth\nLocally unemployment that at twenty eight year low and consumer spending it taking I\nHowever the federal deficit is off the growing by Seventeen percent this past year and trade agreements with our long term trading partners are undergoing significant change it but first question to you leave that\nWhy you see as the direction of this economic growth and what action had the courage to Congress taken that you consider to be beneficial or harmful to the ... economic growth you have sixty second thanks\nWashington's natural resource based economy a health science economy in Spokane and an agricultural economy here in southeast Washington unfortunately this Congress has acted irresponsibly as I mentioned doubling the national debt in two years [noise]\nAh we need leadership that knows fiscal responsibility\nMy economic priorities are clear\nKevin your question regarding immigration last year President Trump's administration ended the DACA program and saying that Congress has not regard to the ongoing crisis in which hundreds of thousands of young people including many young people young people in our valley find themselves\nFirst part of the question is do you support DACA and secondly what do you say to people who ask you what is going to happen to my family and friends I\nHave met with many dark individuals over the last year and and beyond that\nWe needed to give DACA individuals certainty and I have been negotiated legislation voted on legislation to give them give DACA the certainty because many came here no fault of their own and there and they need to have that certainty\nNinety percent of those that come to America legally our family reunification refugees\nUm and and our um and we need a merit based a visa and that's the solution that I have helped draft and supported in Congress\nSo that if someone was in school if they were working or if they were had joined the military that they would be able to get a visa and then over a period of time get a permanent status get in line to be to get citizenship if they would like to do that that's part of the solution that I've promoted\nAnd I am committed to working in a pilot and buy parts in a way to get immigration reform done\nHere is that um when [laughter] I guess would\nBe my question because [noise] uh [noise] because over\nA year ago you said that these DACA\nA student's deserved a path forward and your in leadership and your party is in control of both houses of Congress and the presidency so there is no reason to be talking about what you support or what you negotiated bring the bill forward and it will\nThank you next question is regarding women rights\nThe me too movement encourages women to speak up about sexual harassment and sexual violence and hold perpetrators accountable but movement has also been met with the backlash with it being criticized as having gone too far is that what do you think is the proper place\nShe'll harassment or are we actually regret thing as a result of a movement gone too far well we're not\nRegret thing we have made progress but there's so much more to make when I first moved to Spokane I joined with others and we took on the first women take back the night march to bring up the reality of domestic violence which was not necessarily talked about was hidden and swept under the rug\nOr I serve on the board of the of the YWCA in Spokane and it is sad to understand how many relationships are our suburb because of domestic violence and how much family violence there is\nAnd we need to talk about it we need more than having a victims of domestic violence have their story be told they also deserves justice and due process\nAnd a independent investigations and we need to hold the perpetrators accountable and we need to raise our girls and boys in a new way to prevent future domestic violence\nThank you hear about um [noise] I Believe that those that have been involved in domestic violence sexual assault sexual abuse they need to know that they have a place that they can go and that they can ... and edited a safe place and that is\nWhen when the me too movement was was sweeping the country we had our own situations on Capitol Hill and I led we got some rules change we got legislation passed to give staff\nOn Capitol Hill a place where they could go stab Bush or an office that would give them that that safe place I think it's very important that women know that they this is not acceptable and they have a place they can go\nThank you Cathy your question regarding women's right what do you want the future to look like for women's rights and what are you doing to advance that decision\n[noise] well I Want you know I grew up on a farm [laughter]\nI never imagined I Would one day be serving in Congress I was a two hundred woman ever elected to serve in the United States House of representatives out of\nA nearly eleven thousand who have had the honor of serving I Want every woman to have the confidence that she can be anything she wants to be my daughter's in in the crowd tonight and I want her to ...\nYou can do that this is this is the country that has led the world in raising a\nAn opportunity when I was growing up I never thought about if I was male or female or what opportunities I had because of that I Believe that I could do anything that I wanted to be and that's what I Want for every woman and every man child in in America and this is the country the unique country in the world that that is\nPossible [noise] please ask your that'll there's a big contrast here we are women deserve to have more than confidence we need to be in control of our own reproductive health care choices which is something my opponent opposes [noise]\nShe has also voted to weaken the violence against women act and against the equal pay act for women so we want more women leaders in Congress and it's great that two women leaders running here tonight but we need women leaders who stand up for women's rights\n[noise] I just a quick reminder to the audience please do not applied if you'd like to weigh in on a topic\nWe'll ask at the end to go to end W.
