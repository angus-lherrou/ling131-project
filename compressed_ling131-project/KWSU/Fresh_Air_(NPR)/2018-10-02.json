he's a quid vacated in spite of the evidence presented by American intelligence agencies and journalists when other reporters who is broken stories that have revealed new information to the public about that into the audience\nAnd about connections between the Trump campaign and Russia is my guest Greg Miller he covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post\nThis year he shared a Pulitzer Prize for national reporting now he's written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy\nIt's a chronological narrative connecting many of the most important stories on the subject and adding new reporting to those stories Greg Miller welcome to fresh air is there a story that you helped break the you consider the most consequential story\nOf candidate or President Trump and his administration what I mean there\nThat I had a hand in one way or another uh ... obviously working very closely with some terrific an amazing colleagues here\nI think the one that jumps out for for many people as the story a that said that that former national security adviser Mike Flynn had not been honest about his conversation with the Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak\nWe wrote the story saying that she in fact had discussed the lifting of sanctions on Russia in those conversations and then lied about it to the White House or to news organizations including our own and to the American public\nUh and this was the sort of just one of many huge stories that we broke during that time in a couple of others that I was involved and include\nThe revelation that the CIA had reached a secret conclusion that Russia was not just trying to disrupt the election was about was trying to help elect Donald Trump\nAnd then later when Trump was in office I broke several stories about his rough conversations\nWith foreign leaders ah we had the transcripts of some of those calls and the story about his um revealing of highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister in the oval office\nThat's certainly the ... I guess that had really direct consequences Flynn was fired selling was fired within days yeah yeah so you know you helped write the story that Flynn had cause with the Russian ambassador to the ...\nTelling Kislyak that the Trump Administration would lift sanctions to like don't worry about it\nUh didn't sanctions imposed by the Obama administration and these calls happened\nAfter the election but before the inauguration right so how do you have to get that aren't in is how did you start investigating mystery\nWell I'm you know so\nAfter the post reported that about this secret CIA conclusion that Russia had in fact sought to help elect Donald Trump had had essentially had a candidate in the race\nAnd done what it could um to propel him to the White House I mean it just raised obvious questions about well what was Russia doing this for and was this in any kind of coordination with Donald Trump because of the bizarre things he had said throughout the campaign including Russia\nI'm On the other hand we're things happened that had never happened to me as a reporter\nUm several of us started getting cards actual letters in the in the mail a thanks for readers from far away places\nUm notes on on our on my doorstep at home I Would walk through the neighborhood and suddenly people would stop me and thank me and\nI mean that was that was felt great too and it was odd it was something I had never experienced\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll taxing more if you're just joining us my guess is Washington Post reporter spreads Miller he covers intelligence and national security he's part of the team that shared a Pulitzer this year for national coverage his new book is called The Apprentice Trump\nThe midterm elections are approaching\nAnd was so much going on in the world and moving your own morals [noise]\nIt can be hard to say caught up out of the loop considered has been losing you need to know amateur contacts do need to say up to speed listen to all things considered to be here the bigger picture every afternoon from NPR News [noise]\nStarting at three right here on northwest Public Broadcasting's NPR News service [noise]\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us I guess is Greg Miller Washington Post reporter who covers intelligence and national security he shared a Pulitzer Prize this year and now he's written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia NSM version of American democracy\nAnd it kinda brings together a lot of stories about candidate and President Trump and the Trump Administration stories that have been reported by Miller and other reporters that the Washington Post\nYou know you're right in the book that Trump has avoided consequences for offenses that were long considered politically fatal often by lying in the face of overwhelming evidence Flynn however had noticed that community I was interested that you used the word lion\nAward lying when used in the same sentence as Trump is very kind of controversial in the journalism world because line implies intent\nOf fatherhood is when you speak something that isn't true line implies that you know it's not true and you are saying it anyways\nSo people are just weighing lack is worthy of using the word lie or not so you've used the word lie so I Want to ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like um it is a difficult decision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we also get criticized at the post for being\nToo reluctant to use that word and I think that's true with other news organizations as well but at the same time\nI mean we're here at this moment are you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post to has documented\nFive thousand or more fall swords from this president since he's taken office many of them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff\nTo um to correct his misstatements\nIt's part of Trump's per se contrary complex personality it's part of it and it traces back to his origin as a as a as a public person um I mean we have run fascinating stories here at the post about\nA times earlier in his career when he would adopt phony persona and call reporters for Forbes on the phone and try to lobby them into inflating his net worth for magazines in magazines annual rankings I mean there's a\nThere is an intense here and I don't have any doubt about that or or real any hesitation when appropriate from using the word lie\n[noise] after Flynn resigned under pressure\nOn you spoke to Devin in as a Republican chair of the house intelligence committee and you say that what he told you was basically the opening of what became an ongoing CJD by Trump and his allies to discredit the FBI what did he tell you\nThis was at a time when we're trying to figure out well we now know that Flynn had discussed sanctions would the Russians was basically cutting a deal behind his government's back with Moscow\nAnd that just raised a lots and lots of questions about well who else was in contact with with the Kremlin during the campaign if anyone right so we're we're digging by our news organization and many others\nAnd this was a conversation with the chairman of the house intelligence committee Devin Nunes has who has who is read into all of the most sensitive intelligence on questions like this and I was asking him you know what else is there we are seeing lots of indications contact between Jared Kushner\nAnd and officials for Moscow and other members of the Trump Organization we already knew about Paul Manafort of course and he says that the FBI has been looking at this and all and it's all a dead trail\nAnd I pressed him because I could not believe that he was saying that there was already abundant evidence of contact you could say that that was incidental and meaningless and harmless but you couldn't say didn't exist but\nHe says it you know when I pressed him\nNot even pizza boy delivery contact\nAnd it just struck me at that time that that was\nSo implausible um that he was you know he was trying to throw sand in our eyes basically uh in my eyes as a reporter he was trying to um protect Trump and that that was um more important to him in that conversation then add adhering to the facts that had already been established\nSome

I'm not going to trust and not having an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are your own rules what are your guidelines for using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy at the post who those sources are so they can be confident and do any fact checking that's necessary [noise]\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really I'm In a really important one\nAt this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources um for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources\nWe would really be unable I think to give our readers in the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U.S government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over again I Want one really saying on 'em and source the reporter and listen to the source as it's the ... leaders who are kept in the dark about the SARS but it's not like you know that happened and yelling at the information\nThat's absolutely right the sources are not anonymous to us\nUm these are sources that we know who they are\nUm many in many instances their sources we have known for many years and have developed trust and because of how reliably they have given us information um and you know frankly even in that case when we're writing sensitive stories I we talked earlier about the the Mike Flynn story and how we ended up\nHaving nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the with the publication of that story could have been two or three it's more about the caliber of the sources their their positions and whether they have access to the information that they are providing\nA how trustworthy are they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that sourcing so sometimes you might be asked well what is the position of the ... where is the source and coming from from the story\nUm who are we talking about here and you can you can basically described their positions and government\nSometimes if it's highly sensitive senior editors are going to want to know more they're going to want you to identify your source and that you know that sometimes can get a that can get touchy depending on the nature of your agreement with sore say or source be\nBut it's something you know ultimately despite you know we've\nThe the record just sort of holds up the stories that we've written over the past two years attributed mainly to anonymous sources have almost all proven overtime to be accurate I mean there might be mistakes at the margins here or there were\nA news organizations are perfect and an and we do make mistakes but boy we've gotten a lot right\nUm and I know Marty Baron executive editor at the Washington Post talks frequently about\nYou know the post and other news organizations um are always trying to get it right but at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news\nYou know there's extraordinary care given to getting the facts and even the nuance exactly right it it's really it would really be damaging to not just to post credibility in my credibility as a journalist but to the broader\nUm journalistic community if whenever we get things wrong there's a lot riding on the media right now in its ability to do its job and do it well and do it right let me try to give you one more example of\nThe recording environment that we're trying to operate in just how much pressure we're under us reporters how much pressure our sources are under a\nAs well um there came a time this past year when the Justice Department in Congress released the memos that former FBI Director Jim Comey had kept\nEvery time he met with Trump every time he meets with Trump something happens troubles him he goes straight to his computer type type of mental to record would have would have transpired\nOne of those talks about a conversation he had with Trump in the oval office and most of the coverage about that memo focused on their interactions about what Trump wanted him to do in terms of backing away from the Flynn investigation but Trump has also complaining to call me in that in that setting\nAbout the leaks that are plaguing him at that point early in his administration he's complaining about how are people Howard news organizations learning what I'm saying into this phone and he points to the phone on his desk and the oval office\nHe's complaining about stories and he's talking as I read this memo I realize he's talking about me he's talking about the stories that I had written for the post colonial talking about yes I agree with you sometimes it's great to put somebody had on a pike as an example the Trump goes on a joke about putting\nJokes about how once in a reporter spends a little time in jail they make a new friend suddenly they're willing to talk\nIt's a really disconcerting moment for anybody in journalism anybody who cares about journalism um but for me it it was just eerie um to to think that he's talking specifically about stories I had written for the Washington Post\nThey're talking about heads on pikes reporters in jail chasing down sources it was it was unnerving\nIt make you afraid well let me let me ask you\nWhether it made me afraid I ... I was confident enough in my ability in in how I approach sourcing said I wasn't\nWorried about that I work for a news organization that has my back um and that's a good feeling but it is frightening in a way Terry and I remember talking about this at home um when I saw this memo describing this document to my wife and what was in it\nAnd our seven year old was at the table with us and he heard me talking about it using words like jail and he's following this conversation that I maybe it was being too careless with the parents and bringing the subject up in front of him but he started to cry\nA he started to get really worried and asked whether I was going to be put in jail um it is frightening at some we're just trying to do our jobs um we're just trying to get to the truth we're trying to\nFulfill the role that the founders invasion for for the media in this country and it's an important mission\nClinton Miller thank you so much for talking with us and thank you so much for your reporting\nThank you\nGlenn Miller is the author of the new book The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy he covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post\nAfter we take a short break TV critic David being cruelly will consider how the season premiere of Saturday Night live and sixty minutes covered last week's Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings this is ...\n[noise] President Trump is celebrating a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico what will it take to get Congress to say yes [noise] tomorrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News starting\nAt five right here on the NPR News service of northwest public broadcasting [noise]\n\nSome WHYY in Philadelphia I'm Terry Gross with fresh air today Michael Lewis out there in the best sellers money ball and the big short talks about his new book the fifth risk it examines the federal government under President Trump by focusing on three departments energy agriculture and commerce\nWhich together are responsible for controlling risk you wouldn't associate with those department conducting hurricane and overseeing our stockpile of nuclear weapons\nThere was that half of the top seven hundred jobs in the Trump Administration I still unfilled and some of the people who have been appointed have conflicts of interest or unqualified making them unprepared to deal with many of them potentially\nAnd many of these are not risk most people think [noise]\nPerson is\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm ...

the fist risk by my gas to journalist Michael Lewis who's also the author of the best sellers money ball and the big short which were adopted into films and the undoing project\nLewis lifted Trump's government by focusing on three departments energy commerce an agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or a corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service is part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the Energy Department many responsibilities [noise]\nMany essential positions and the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says I filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing well others have conflicts of interest our political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this an article published in Vanity Fair Michael Lewis welcome back to ... explain what the fifth risk is\nShort answer is is the risk that you failed to imagine it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you and the longer answer is what I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump\nI come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as a wandering around the federal government trying to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what I'm asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture part or even the White House to name kind of the top risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with kind of three or four and then they can't think of this so I thought that's the moment where the mine failed to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nWhat I found about how the Trump Administration has gone about taking over the federal government\nWhat kind of light the fire under me is when I discovered that the Obama administration spent the better part of a year and thousands of people's lives preparing essentially the best course at every been created in in how to run the federal government or what was going on inside the federal government\nAnd that this course was meant to be delivered to whoever won the election the day after the election starting the day after the election and they were expecting hundreds of people to roll in to to receive these briefings and nobody showed up nobody to bring in many cases when I go get get get these briefings I'm the first person to have got them\nAnd I I thought well this enterprise is managing all these risks eight imagines but we as a society don't spend much time thinking about\nUm it it's being neglected ignored and and uh is operating on the basis of ignorance so I thought what happens when you do that across a big portfolio of risks like the federal government runs and eat what you what happens is you\nYou amplify the risk you you create the probability of these risk actually causing problems\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fist risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments [noise]\nYou know I'm Wondering there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the mother investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh confirmations story\nAnd not as much attention being paid to what's happening on the cabinet level on a department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about you know agriculture commerce energy\nThat most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nAnd never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like we're a society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a true we had a prior to the big decided it ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of\nOf abuse and scorn in his collected rough and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and is is having at it and nobody's paying much to know is paying much attention because of slow moving stores and this to me you know one aspect of the fifth risk\nIs we've got a lot of the risk that the government managers are very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another ah cleaning up uh\nYou know horrible toxic waste\nSlow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been frost is very short term attitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration has incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle\nAnd the public has gone along with it and that's ... that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department and I don't like that kind of level of government where things are being done with physicians aren't being replaced where people are being appointed who aren't really appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions as the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about immigrants we ask atomic bomb includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department is really Noah first of all what they're doing in the Commerce Department [laughter]\nIt's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department including the national weather service titled National Weather service at ... and now there was a versus the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War next Nixon got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department as an actor vengeance so if there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department [noise] uh\nAnd it does it eat most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical and I'm into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nYou're talking about Barry Myers who is the C.

N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good thing he runs a weather Prediction Center okay well\nRuns no a as a as a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... no one is a giant science operation um the problem is that the national weather service uh\nWhich has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but\nBut but weather prediction has gotten generally dramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them an image and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better\nOr all of that saves lives and property or\nIf that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public uh it it has to let the rest of it has and has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a\nHas been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to essentially forbid the national weather service from\nFrom doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a a a weather event that might kill you and the problem with is is that well in the first place is the the ... the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the uh the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data and then makes it available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and you know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the day to the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts\nBut what he's been trying to do is organized essentially a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYou're talking about the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons\nDid he get no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is naturally or a government operation and so and it's a naturally a governor operation to deliver a weather forecast for the public\nSo Barry Myers or had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now [noise]\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the shift risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from cancer treatment centers of America working to outsmart can't use of genomic testing to profile each individual is Ken and revealed possible treatment option\nLearned more about precision cancer treatment that Cancer Center dot com\nOffering a tire decision guy to help consumers find pirated fit their car and driving conditions\nWith a network of more than seven thousand independent installers\nDirect dot com helping drivers find deliver install\nThe federal government spend billions replenishing beaches after big storm like Hurricane Florence at least in richer coastal community a look at beachfront property value than federal priority next time on marketplace\nStarting at three thirty and again at six thirty right here on northwest public broadcasting\nFor the pollution and Louis card valley scattered showers and breezy conditions today I used in the mid to upper sixties when in showers linger tonight with gusts up to forty miles an hour lows in the upper thirties to lower forties sun comes out Wednesday was cooler temperatures in the upper fifties to mid sixties\nNorthwest public broadcasting listener contributions and business sponsorship\nAnd during laboratories in Pullman and ed medics there's information about sponsors in the community at N.

I\nWould love to have one outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all assuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk\nThat he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say\nA Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption and the treasury bond market they stole money in the first place from is we're not going to pay the Chinese back this is a a larger way of saying that I think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in face in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding\nWe have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt he's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt\nI'm a ... that wouldn't shocked me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why would if you treat them at the national crisis\nWell because the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots and lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable they'd be a flight out of the dollar\nA U.S treasury bonds or the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be you know better than gold\nCollapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow was going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like\n... predict what might trigger the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it some sort of political event\nAnd it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun when you predict things funding sort of predict things where where we may happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it ah\nI think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming\n[noise] my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\n[noise] drinking water around the country and polluted with a potentially harmful group of chemical Trump Administration is working on a plan to regulate them on the next all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nStarting at three right here on your NPR News service northwest public broadcasting [noise]\nFor the pollution and Louis ... valley scattered showers and breezy conditions today highest in the mid to upper sixties\nWhen in showers linger tonight with gusts up to forty miles an hour lows in the upper thirties to lower forties sun comes out Wednesday was cooler temperatures in the upper fifties to mid sixties\nNorthwest public broadcasting is joined by cascade auto center in its mission of bringing distinctive programs to the northwest everyday inspiring dialogue discourse and discovery if you also support these values you can find out more about becoming a program sponsor at N.
