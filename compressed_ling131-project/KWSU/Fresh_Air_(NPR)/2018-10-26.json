Madness was seen by Ninety seven million TV viewers\nOur guest writer Michael ... says the money and recognition the sport generates has led to a host of corrupt practices in the recruitment of players for the top college basketball programs talented athletes as young as twelve or targeted for manipulation by St agents soccer love described as dealers in human athletic flash\nMany of those corrupt practices were exposed in an FBI investigation which led to a sprawling indictment that rocked the basketball world last year\nIn the first of three trials in case the federal jury yesterday convicted three men of conspiring to use cash payments to recruit players to college basketball programs including the University of blue of all it's legendary coach Rick Pitino wasn't charged but the scandal cost him his job\nHe's one of the subjects of ... new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball I spoke to cycle of yesterday when the jury in the case was still deliberating well my ... welcome back to fresh air\nYou know any enterprise that generates large sums of money can be beset by corruption how much money does college basketball generate\nBillions I mean it really depends on how you calculate it but directly to the universities and to the NC double a billions but if you figure in the gambling money and money that's generated by recruiting sites in all these crazy ways\nYou know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year right and what is the money go [noise]\nThe money largely goes to the adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which has program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out Thirteen scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year the rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight million dollars a year just the assistant coaches who make as much as a half million dollars a year\nAll throughout the athletic department people are making six figure salaries it does not go to the players and what I call the unpaid workforce\nHow big is the NCAA a championship tournament March Madness\n[noise] just about a billion dollars a year goes to the NC double a itself which is the non ...\nOff and all kinds of different directions is where you get into the two or three billion dollars it's the kind of money that pro franchises are are making or generating the differences that they're actually paying the players\nYou're right about the University of Louis all what you said was kind of quiet commuter school\nUntil it a new athletic director guy named Tom Juravich came in and had big ambitions and invested in big time coaches and new facilities stadiums and and basketball arenas and and he made a ton of revenue from it did it have benefits for the rest of the school\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I associate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's\nFourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as out of business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life and one of the things that really struck me\nWhen I have been around grassroots basketball is the kids who referred to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business of basketball\n[noise] Michael ... book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino the story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball we'll continue our conversation after a short break this is fresh air\nFifty years ago the threat came from Russian nuclear missile stationed in Cuba nowadays President Putin's weapon of choice seems to be poised to Moscow paid a price for targeting an elderly retired spy with a deadly nerve agent but what does Russia up to and who's next [noise] this free Paul file [noise] next time on one hand\nYou can hear one day and about forty minutes right here on your NPR newscaster that north last public broadcasting [noise]\nThis is fresher and we're speaking with journalist Michael ... has a new book about corruption in recruitment in college basketball but it's called the last temptation of Rick Pitino\n[noise] so in a lot of cases families will move uh they're promising young basketball player to a different city for a high school that's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives too\nYou're right that on the college end of this is the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain what they do how they're paid [noise] the assistant\nCollege coaches are the sort of ones who first make contact with a young player in his family\nThey fly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches that used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball\nThat you win in July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments\nThat's the job get me kids thinking in\nThe industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that many of the head coach who say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bringing them to me there are things I don't want to know\nThese assistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back into business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nI had these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of the story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges\n[noise] but then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there [noise]\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this\nSo in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the intent of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send them to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\n[noise] All right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you managed to have ... in some way or another get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you\nNBA player over the course of the ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more\nSo if you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or can over those players that adds up to a whole lot if you\nMight add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting water money manager might make there's a lot you do you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars if I were a future NBA player or I were the family of a future NBA player\nI don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people who serve professional athletes\nManage their money or if you get traded there are specialists who will set you up in a new city they will go to private schools and figure out what private school your trial should go to\nThey will find you designer for your new house and and interior designer so sports is a very insular business and a lot of the players want to deal with known quantities\nAnd part of this is there's the money manager she manages NBA players money so the game is to become one of those guys and then they have one of these go between set you up with a with players\nMichael ... new book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball after a break he'll

new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino is about a recruiting scandal in college basketball\nLast year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal when these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news\nWere people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\n[noise] they absolutely were not shocked\nWhat the FBI I did was put names and faces to what many people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock and what that was was\nThat the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms\nAs opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double way it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at prison time that was a shock\nAnd has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\n\nThink overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball the legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke which is quoted as saying\nIt's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but the fact that coach case that it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and\nA determination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean\nWhat college sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and at a certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe when the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for particular programs and\nThey're not real students their loyalty and their\nTheir responsibility is to their teen first which takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week\nAnd you're not paying them you know you were you are having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through not necessarily getting a degree coming out with some injuries\nAnd yet the NC double a persists in the myth of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nA while to come back to one thing you said earlier you said a lot of people knew that the shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations is a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nI Do think it will make some difference but I think that difference will be\nJust in the way that people conduct possibly criminal activity I think people will be more careful and you're already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them you know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts\nCareful sunny the ... the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grassroots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy he also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone\nSo there's an element of all of this that makes this look like just common criminal activity\nIt makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on the case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we covered this I mean ... you said that in some respects [noise] shooting apparel companies look pretty bad in this what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in these charges\nThe apparel companies have been very quiet they have put out sort of analysis statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet\nThere is a Adidas executive who is one of the three current defendants his name is James ghetto\nHe's being represented by a lawyer hired by Adidas and finally James ghetto who this Adidas executive his father was a high school coach he's an insider he's a basketball insider almost all of these defendants are well liked\nWell known insiders they're not people who operated you know outside the system I think one of the scariest things for people in the basketball industry to the extent that that they are alarmed is\nThese people were them they were family they were part of the basketball fraternity and Adidas and Under Armour and Nike are part of the corporate basketball fraternity and I don't think they're planning on much to change either if they can help it\nMichael ... thanks so much for speaking with us thank you it's great to be on with you\nMichael ... new book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball\nWe spoke

I just wanted to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that [noise] but when ... left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI have a girl price on Iran exactly\nKnow and and uh I once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being\nBecause father for Monday and at that point in my research I I took loose story as you know the truth and I said well what his father ever of giving them money she said of course he would have given him money you know if it's anything from the you know he was he was the oldest son is Jewish family and\nYou know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around you know a lot of what lose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand whatever Lou needed anything he was there and\nYou know that was one of the complexities Lou dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know ... ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seen\nAnother thing that really like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his arm he didn't have any money not he said he got a job working for his father hyping up in his father's accounting often yes exciting transgressions that [laughter] I'm\nNot totally they don't have any I always see what's hey guys you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was that for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to to buy time in making money and if they were they had already ... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that's a nice little quit the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car driving back to Long Island I mean I could never get confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they kind of relationship it was a [noise]\nYou know along with a you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt I mean he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names was never like mom and dad\nUm and you know he certainly would characterize them in song you know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl\nBut ah yeah but in real life you know we got along with them fairly well [noise] so early\nIn the velvet underground period they team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of ...\nAnd what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they went didn't work for them in lead\nWell that's yeah that's a very interesting question because you know um [noise] yeah ... uh an anti wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular and I'm just going to make some movies now and you know and since like we should have a bad yeah rock and roll is going to be saying and\nSo they found the velvet underground um you know through some feel on the audience who had gone to see them and thought they might work for ... [noise]\nUm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio\nDecided that the the velvet underground more kind of too boring looking so they got Nico yeah who is a you know a German model an actress and soon to be finger\nTo you know to be their lead singer Lewis not crazy about that but I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of disability\nThat was going to what's important and that he would just go along with it he limited Nico sports as patient as much as he could you know um she only saying you know a few songs\nA band with pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band\nAnd as soon as he could have gotten the you know he kick Nico has the band as well after having an affair and well that's very true [laughter] exactly you know part of those times\nUm and that was a you know so that was one of the issues with Warhol\nA Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York where I'm at a time where I was in the newspapers all the time you're not\nYou know not art critics writing about it and although that too but it's just like a this crazy guy you know he thinks that Campbell Soup cans or art and he went to this party and the other day I mean and every day was in the newspapers do whatever he did got attention\nAnd ah you know Lou took advantage of that but that also hurt the velvet underground and not you know rock and roll certainly back that was a pretty Ernest thing and the Warhol seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a band\nYou know for for people who had entered them yet you know in hurt I'm amazing they are\nSo you know I think eventually like once they made you know\nHis self image and his persona\n[noise] well you know Lou how complicated feelings about it\nIt's kind of you know the coming thing\nAnd uh you know ... you know I have a clue like there was a very conventional aspect of but we I mean much as he was a boundary breaker she always you know kind of respected his elder you know and and the people who had an important influence on him and Lou Reed was right at the top of that list\nAnd so she you know bully offered to produce transformer and restore it\nYou know lose standing after the velvet underground and created a solo career for him and gave him his only hit 'em they'll walk on the wall side was on that record um [noise] you know so little of course yeah once you got to hit that he desperately wanted your kind of came to resent it and\nYou know thought of it as um you know just to kind of pop song and why do people sort of reduced me too that\nUh but at the time that he needed it he really needed it and he really wanted it and I'm ... and ... guitar player mc ... who co produced I'd album with a with with David\nA day created that song and also you know other beautiful songs like you know perfect day and satellite of love that are that are on that record and uh you know made it such a you know such a significant album for Lu\nWanna walk on that ... from that album and um this was his only real like radio hit and it was a big ... I'm In the sun the lyrics are inspired by some other trans women he knew from Andy Warhol factory cells so let's hear it and then on top of that [noise]\n\nCalling from Miami ... hitchhiked away from us they\nPlugged ... rounds on the way to shave their legs and then he was a she says the they take a walk in the wild things that have honey take a walk in the wild [noise]\n\nCandy games from now on the island is\nActually read walk on the outside transformer which was produced with David Bowie I'm so that so that was actually a head friendly to read from your book like this\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire he'll look Lou Reed grew up in an era where you know there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible there to be a rock band to have credibility and not have heads before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know [laughter] I'm learning more government that is that yeah yeah precisely and even if you did have hits [laughter] you know you\nGot a year or two and then you went home but\nUm you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA\nA but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as want us to do serious things and\nAnd take left turns and you know go in New directions and so the degree to which you know the record companies like oh okay great we've got ahead like now let's do take another walk on the wild side or walk on the website again and that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nOr you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh I'd lie in ... but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and a crazy move because it was you know such a harsh and depressing records [noise] um [noise]\nSo you know he would turn it on himself you know he would he would do whatever you needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once you have destroyed instead you know because the next thing was\nRock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record it I'm a big success at a big seller was alive album and a good one [noise] um yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career was just an hour of just\nYou know deafening guitar feedback and it was again a gesture that went on ... before Lou did it\nAnd I'm just I didn't want that he wanted to have it needs to reach people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance\nExactly and it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like [laughter]\nHonestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm [noise] um so I'm ... and ... you say that\n[noise] um well one thing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a which is documented quite movingly or in the song street hospital apart called slip away\nWhere you know you said you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and [noise] you know he in an interview you know at that time you know said you know that was real she did that I mean essentially they're saying like Rachel Neal stole whatever jewelry with around and took off and [noise]\nUm I think they had been falling apart from lots of lots of theorize about why that is in some sense of\nI'm Rachel wanting to make a transition as she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met I'm Sylvia morale is who became his second wife\nAnd you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was\nUm [noise] you know over the course of two or three years Lu got clean\nA got straight and um and his gay life became something that\nI mean he's still honored in certain ways of song like Halloween parade or a you know there would be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was out there as anybody could be he also turned on it and are\nOften not with that you know that much um [noise]\nBitterness but uh but still we would never discuss it [noise]\nYou know so I I Want to play a different accept at St ... the ... not to slip away part that you referred to sure where the part that's about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so called just fell in different about it it's almost the setting and listen to you but it's it's yeah it's great music and it's great writing [noise]\nUm so it didn't in the middle part [laughter] on a street house I'm trying to think about that that's part yeah I'm\nDrawing on the story of a guy who used to be around the factories\nBy a car that mean that was the official story the unofficial story that we studied died of a heroin overdose in somebody's apartment and they got dragged out onto the street and just left him by the doc I'm as if he had you know I had an accident of some kind\nOf a blue turns that male character which were female character and then you have described the guys who was the host of the party 'em urging she's got to get to a girl body out if there's a partner [noise]\nMuch here at liberty [noise]\nYou don't live in a really nice talking to that really that was a little more tends to be\nThere would you know who can be having tried this winter we do but how was your opening I'd just\nLike me to tell where there was no one knew what made you know I'm going to go into the Internet news with the universe checking in June\nAnd [noise] the way some and then you see the long\nRun through the the word is it I don't have to get a motel and I know I Know when I turned it in my brain you know the religion lay around and by morning you know the answer on\nYou know people that I Do enjoy listening to talk about what they call the numbers and neither of them\nThe right to be one following you know it's called bad luck
