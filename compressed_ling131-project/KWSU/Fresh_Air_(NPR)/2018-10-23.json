I mean it was embellish [noise]\nBeautiful trees\nLiterary\nLittle tricks lone mothers was\nAs if you're not understanding the world of elite\nCollectibles literary articles that are supposed\nTo be fooled pieces of paper to go with\nAm selling to come home she goes [noise]\nThat there was a waste of a secret I should've gone out they're not in Iraq and holding the rock because I get a better response was to be told [noise]\nThe only one was that [laughter]\nBut listen McCarthy welcome to fresh air and love you in this new movie so congratulations on it this is a really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic did are way\nBut I wouldn't call it a movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you know physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent an a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you [noise]\nUm I think it's a it's a new direction for how\nI'm quite comfortable and I was kind of think if you you know put all the all the things I've done together I I may have even done more drama than than comedy in its totality but uh [noise] and you realize I most people haven't seen a lot of that it was incredibly far off Broadway plays\nAnd make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you're very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter] when\nThe right in the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing yet um you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can and it really wasn't a point of it oh okay no no\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data inside we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny [noise]\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to term it for more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it because we have things like that do happen and I said if it's less about gross for growth and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like you have to look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the fact of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and\nAnd how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nAnd interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter] within it'd be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do grows out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality by doing gross out scenes so your response is really interesting 'cause you're saying that's that's not really what was in ...\nOr or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a\nVulnerable humiliation that we can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all fall into the wrong thing had some shaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that's that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if\nThat particular action hasn't happened to most people [noise]\nMelissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insult [laughter]\nInsulting no [laughter] I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know I don't know what are you not [laughter] but but the most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kids and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and it's become a feud between the three parents\nAnd they're all called in to meet with the principal and the ... the other couples allegedly manpower ... couple have threatened you so\nYou're all just kind of going at each other in the office so let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash than he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do hit him or you know when I said was that we need to keep an extra ... and our kids because with all the technological advances having to learn to use them responsibly\nNo no when he well he said to me was he told me\nWhat language Catherine language learning how to relate what they do not fall to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her thing next door\nMusic man maybe if I looked more like this fake couple of big commercial that's what you look like like you're a big commercial Koppel none of this talk it's productive I Would like to enjoy my legs and kick you out in a job with my ... bone\nJust really scaring me this is what happens when you cornered rat you corner me I won't you drew you to you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of ... improving insults in that scene in it just got back on and on with more over the top insult\nAnd solve you know I Know I Do not oh go round insulting people um I Hope ever um\nI don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I got it all out on on screen but [noise]\nYeah one of the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] never say that and the first time a sitting with with that said we're watching you say you set all of it and I I didn't\nRemember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say every anything that came up the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything so um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory\nHow'd you improv insults before [noise] yes I've had a ... and only have\nPlayed a lot of kind of very assertive um characters that you know I think in the heat\nEspecially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just it you literally say anything she has to kind of kind of tear people down and I think kind of try to stand her\nIn her own authorities so it was a big part of that character and you're very aggressive detective in that very aggressive detective um there is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but\nIt's part of the fun of getting to act you do these things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher\nYou know you're you're just ripping insults that someone and uh there is a there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nMy guess is Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new film can

Pullman regional hospital and it's the Vinci robotic assisted surgery program with six da Vinci train surgeons and got a call ... in general surgery and nearly one thousand cases performed more information about robotic assisted surgery is at Pullman regional dot org\nI did duplex as one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise]\nWhen you went into a regular comedy clubs something that I really didn't like was there is this element there was always one\nTo one guy always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy\nAnd he was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like your top off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does it ever worked for you is any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my chop off [laughter]\nLike he just every time\n[noise] and the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling it just really shut them down like truly shutter now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise]\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person film Barris that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to heck with God [noise]\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work than where I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of thing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I always kind of go down that road like just so surprising like can I get a show of hands for women who\nWho isn't crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do vote for him and talk about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person to finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she is a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAnd they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there to somebody there was a comedy club owner like happened I was watching tang times oh my God I saw the light oh\nAround ever present uh not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white men\nFlash and it's like I Am\nYes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know the stage explodes it is\nTo the other comics ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a oh my God it's a really big deal yeah and the feeling other people's time ears stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they're going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something much to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booth and I thought it was kind of a non verbal um applause from the manager\nKind of a room shot like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on a laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me\nHe is really encouraging me and then I [noise] I got off to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was there that I truly didn't know\nYou don't want to know women who has taken on like producing and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act immaterial\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles\n[noise] I think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where I don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read for kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant I was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their house and I was just thoughts\nLove and like are filled with\nQuirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even just like people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was\nReally bland and and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like car all [laughter] I say I'm Still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like\nWhy didn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer I just couldn't I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this because I don't know why she's doing it\nI'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors their careers or at least temporarily\nEnded because they were ousted for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger Munnell behavior yeah try to women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered in Hollywood now [noise] every little\nInch I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that it is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys\nThere has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think it's so important to me too it's it's branching out to every one it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and I think the more we we linked up and and realize their strength and numbers\nIt can't be for the worse\nHomeless McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it

at five\nThis is fresh air I'm Terry Gross we're about to have perhaps the most important midterm election of our time the outcome will determine who controls the house and the Senate in a very divisive era as well as who governs key battleground states the results could be determined by who has the right to vote\nSince the ... election over twenty states have adopted new restrictions on voting such a strict voter ID laws cut back to early voting and aggressive purging voters\nSince twenty fourteen hundreds of thousands of people were purged from the rolls in states that have a so called use it or lose a policy which removes people from the rolls if they haven't voted frequently enough\nIn Georgia alone that policy purged an estimated a hundred seven thousand voters according to a new investigation by American Public Media's investigative unit\nAnd twenty Thirteen the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the voting rights act\nBut current ballot initiatives in several states could make it easier in the future to register to vote in those states and to crack down on gerrymandering I guess Ari Berman has been covering developments in voting rights and voting restrictions he's the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America\nHe's a senior writer for Mother Jones reporting fellow of the nation Institute and there's also written about voting issues with the New York times magazine and Rolling Stone\nAri Berman welcome back to fresh air before we talk state by state and get into specifics is it a coincidence that there are voters being perjure asked for IDs ideas that many citizens don't have in several states\nIt's not a coincidence and let me just give you the big picture of what's happening with voting rights right now\nSo since the twenty ten election twenty four states have implemented a new restrictions on voted for nearly half the states in the country have tightened their voting laws to do things like require strict forms of photo ID to cast\nClose polling places or to purge the voter rolls and many of these restrictions on voting are playing out now in the ... elections in critical states like Georgia North Dakota Kansas et cetera where there are very close elections\nSo is it a coincidence that all of this is happening\nIt's not a coincidence this has really been a major strategy within the Republican Party\nAfter the two thousand eight election when Republicans gained control of a number of really important states and twenty ten\nThey began to introduce a wave of new restrictions to tighten access to the ballot than those efforts were basically given a green light by the Supreme Court when it removed a critical part of the voting rights act in twenty Thirteen and the Shelby County versus hold her decision\nAnd said that those states with the longest histories of discrimination no longer had to approve their voting changes with the federal government that allowed states in the south that previously had to approve their voting changes with the federal government\nPlaces like Texas and Georgia North Carolina and Alabama to implement these new restrictions on voting so I think you're seeing a national effort\nThe secretary of state is also running for office\nSo let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state is also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's running for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nNot just any secretary of state Terry I Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state in the country and he has really been the leader\nIn the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission which was formed in a very high profile way and then shut down before it actually did anything but it requested voter data\nFrom all fifty states which set off a huge firestorm last year Kobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally in the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by Trump or Kobach to support this than the less Kobach is really the guy who was formed intellectual case for restricting voting and what he's done\nIn Kansas is a few things\nHe wrote a law that was passed by the Kansas Legislature called the safe act\nThat did a few concrete things when it came to restricting voting the first thing it did is that it required proof of citizenship to register to vote meaning that you had to have a passport or a birth certificate or naturalization papers to register to vote\nThis law blocked one in seven cans ... almost thirty five thousand people from reading\nHas almost no evidence of voter fraud in Kansas to justify the potential disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters so so that part of the law has been struck down but another part of the law of voter id law where you have to show government issued id to be able to vote that part of the law remains in effect that I've looked at the numbers in Kansas\nAnd over twelve hundred ballots have been tossed since Kobach was secretary of state of Kansas because voters showed up at the polls without having the right id\nBut Kobach only won his primary his Republican primary by three hundred and fifty one vote and now he's locked in a very close election with Democrat Laura Kelly\nWho's a member of the state Senate and independent candidate Greg Orman\nAnd even the smallest reduction in turnout could shift the race in Kobach favor\nAnd the government Accountability Office did a study of Kansas voter id law and they found that Kansas voter id law in twenty twelve and it was first in effect reduce turn out by ... percent\nIn that state with the largest drop off among black voters young voters and first time voters and these are all people that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the traditional Republican base\nHe said that Kris Kobach was actually the source of President Trump's false claim that millions of people voted in legally and twenty sixteen and if you compensate for all of illegal votes Trump would have won the popular vote and not Hillary so what is called that do to plant that idea\nKris Kobach met with Donald Trump after the election basically Kobach was a disappointing for a cabinet position he was under consideration to be head of the department of homeland security\nAnd ... had to study not a very legitimate study but nonetheless it was a study that he gave Donald Trump that purported to show that three million people had voted illegally in the twenties sixteen election and shortly after this meeting with Kobach\nTrump tweeted that millions of people voted legally and when I interviewed Kobach for the New York times magazine last year he told me that he was the source of Trump's claim\nAnd showed me this study that purport to show this however when the author of that study who was a professor at Old Dominion university testified in a federal lawsuit challenging Kansas proof of citizenship law\n... own expert disavowed that study and basically said it didn't show anywhere near that three million people voted illegally\nTests and the census might not seem like it's actually a voting issue but it is a voting issue called back advocated for adding a question about citizenship are you a citizen [noise] um how does that apply to voting right\nIt's a huge issue because census data is used to draw voting districts it's used to draw districts for state legislatures\nIt used to draw districts for the U.S house its use to determine how many electoral votes each state has so the census was instrumental when it comes to voting and what happened according to court documents\nIs that Steve Bannon at the time and the chief strategist to Donald Trump\nCalled commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who's in charge of running the census and says I Want you to talk to Kris Kobach about adding this question about us citizenship to the census and what Kris Kobach toad Ross as he suggested wording for the citizenship question and then he said\nIt's needed because right now in his words illegals or being counted when it comes to representation I\nI don't want to get to technical here Terry but the the way that districts are drawn is they're based on total population so everyone in a given area is counted\nWhen it comes to drawn a district in deciding what level representation an area should have\nWhat Kobach wants to do is restrict those districts to only counting people who are citizens\nIf you did that areas with lots of non citizens places like Texas and New York and California would have much less representation\nThan places where there's a lot more citizens\nIf Kobach has his way districts are going to be drawn only based on citizenship what that will mean is that will be a major power shift to Republicans because generally speaking areas of lots of immigrants tend to vote democratic if you exclude them from counting then despite the massive demographic change we're seeing\nIs that the districts are going to become more conservative and this question about us citizenship hasn't been asked on the census since Nineteen fifty and there's a tremendous fear that if it is asked\nLatinos Asian Americans other minorities whether documented or undocumented are going to be afraid to respond to the census and that the areas where these people live will get fewer political seeds less money less political representation than they otherwise\nOur six different federal lawsuits challenging this question the most high profile lawsuits is being led by New York and sixteen other states and basically what they're saying is that this question is going to have a major league suppressive effect\nOn people responding to the question that you're going to see how many people are afraid to give their citizenship on the census because they're worried about Donald Trump's immigration policies and they don't want to tell Donald Trump what their legal status\nIs and that's going to affect the entire senses and so if the that just is unfair consensus is that accurate than so many things to the census does is going to be unfair and an accurate as well\nMy guess is Ari Berman author of give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America\nAnd senior reporter at Mother Jones after a break we'll talk more about voting restrictions and ballot measures that may expand voting rights and look at the Supreme Court with Brett Kavanaugh on the bench and how it would likely respond to cases pertaining to voter suppression and voting rights\nI'm Terry Gross and fresh air\n[noise]\nThen you know our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR

sunny today with a slight chance of the afternoon showers high proponent listen I'm sixty seven tonight just guys will be mostly cloudy which lows in the mid to upper forties and tomorrow will be another sunny day and a little cooler with ties in the lower sixties\nLots of questions and it can be tough to explain why the ocean and salty or how Bones Are formed but they can get answers to their science questions when they ask Dr universe sending questions and watch episodes on N. W. P. B. dot org and on northwest public television\nBecause they have a felony convictions so ten percent of people in the most important swing state in the country that has routinely decided presidential elections aren't able to participate in aren't able to vote in twenty Eighteen and this ballot initiative would restore voting rights to up to one point four million people in Florida\nThat would be the largest in franchise meant of new voters since the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia in North Dakota and Kansas in other states\nFlorida has a chance to give the right to vote back to more people than at any time since the Nineteen sixties and and that's the good news that help doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news\nSo Rick Scott the governor of Florida who you described as the chief enforcer of this felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate against three term incumbent amounts than\nHe is and so here you have a situation where the architect of a policy that has disenfranchised one point six million ex felons in Florida is running for office\nAnd the people disenfranchised by Rick Scott aren't able to vote against him and previous governors in Florida have restored voting rights to many more people than Scott has Jeb Bush the governor of Florida are stored voting rights to Seventy seven thousand ex felons\nCharlie Crist Jeb Bush's successor restored voting rights to a hundred and fifty five thousand ex felons in Florida\nRick Scott has only restored voting rights to three thousand people in Florida\nDuring his eight years as governor so he is implemented this felon disenfranchisement law in the most restrictive way possible and it's not just his race Florida could also elect the first black governor in their states history Andrew Gillum but you have a situation where five hundred thousand half a million\nDisenfranchised African Americans aren't able to vote potentially to elect the state's first black governor\n[noise] so in the past there have certainly been a lot of voting related court decisions that have been appealed as high as a Supreme Court the Supreme Court now has added Brett Kavanaugh to the bench what's his position on voting rights\nShe has from the cases we've seen a pretty alarming record on voting rights she upheld a voter id law from South Carolina and twenty twelve that the Obama administration had opposed and said could disenfranchise\nAnd he basically said that even if there was no evidence of voter fraud is that states could enact new restrictions on voting and that sets a very broad precedent for Republican controlled states like Georgia like North Dakota light Kansas to enact\nNew restrictions on voting and even if there is no evidence of the kind of fraud that they are purporting to crack down on\nThey can uphold these measures as legal ... even if they just say that they're intended to in cabinet as words uh promote the integrity of the election and so he is going to be joining\nA very conservative court already this was the same Supreme Court remember and Terry in twenty Thirteen that got at the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd he is going to be less open to potentially striking down these restrictions than his predecessor Anthony Kennedy who was already pretty conservative on these issues was and so now we're facing the most conservative court on civil rights issues since the Jim Crow era\nAnd there is a tremendous amount of fear that Brett Kavanaugh is going to give a green light to the kind of voter suppression efforts that we're seeing playing out in the ... election right now\nLike chief justice John Roberts has now considered to be the swing vote in the court with his record on voting rights\n[noise] it's amazing to me that Roberts is now considered the swing vote on the court when he has really been the most aggressive advocate on the court\nFor limiting voting rights and this goes back many years when John Roberts was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department all the way back in the Nineteen eighties he led efforts\nTo weaken the voting rights act that was a key part of his portfolio and then when he joined the Supreme Court he authored the twenty Thirteen decision had got the heart of the voting rights act and ruled that those states the longest histories of discrimination no longer needed to prove their voting changes with the federal government Roberts mocks the idea\nThat voting discrimination was still widespread pervasive and his words\nAnd in fact everything that we're seeing right now which seemed to contradict that the fact that there are\nSo many new barriers to voting both in states that were covered by the voting rights act to places like Texas and Georgia orange states that weren't covered by this one provision of the voting rights act like Kansas the fact that there is such widespread\nVoting discrimination that we're seeing right now\nTo have more protections against voting discrimination but instead the Supreme Court did the opposite and voting rights advocates are extremely worried that all of these new restrictions on voting when they go before the Supreme Court are basically going to be upheld\nThe argument for voting restrictions is fraud that you have to do this to prevent fraud if you look nationally and voting fry how pervasive hazard than\nEvery study shows that voter fraud is a very small problem in American elections not non existent but incredibly rare\nThat from two thousand to twenty fourteen according to one study there were only thirty one cases of voter impersonation out of one billion votes cast\nSo even in states where there are no voter ID laws like New York where I live it's very difficult to commit fraud in New York but we do is we sign our names at the polling station and they have to check\nThat the signature on file matches they signature that were signing when we go to vote well if I wanted to commit voter fraud in New York in a state with out of voter id law I Would have to find a voter I Would have to know what their addresses I Would have to know what their signature looks like I Would have to know that they hadn't voted already\nAnd I would be facing potentially five years in jail a felony conviction a tremendous fine and I would only be shifting one extra vote after all of that\nSo it doesn't mean that voter fraud never occurs but the penalties for voter fraud are already very high the mechanisms that we have in place already deter people from doing it\nIf you try to commit fraud you're most likely to get caught and then you're are only shifting a very small number of votes one vote usually most\nAnd so what I see based on the data is that the number of people prevented from voting by restrictions on voting is exponentially larger than the cases of voter fraud or see\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is journalist Ari Berman he's the author of the book give us the ballot modern struggle for voting rights in America\nIs also a senior reporter for Mother Jones who's
