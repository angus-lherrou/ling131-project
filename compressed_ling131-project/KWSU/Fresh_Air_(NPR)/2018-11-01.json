Anthony Kennedy after Kennedy retired now the chief\nThis is my guest David Kaplan says the court has reached the point where justices are often seen as political proxies of the Republican or Democratic Party\nHis new book is about how the court became so politicized and so powerful\nIt also includes profiles of several of the justice in the book is based in part on ... interviews with several of the current justices as well as pass justices sixty five law clerks who worked at the Supreme Court and congressional and White House officials dating back to the Reagan Administration [noise]\nA lot of the interviews were done on the condition that he not named the source Kaplan is also a former legal affairs editor at Newsweek where he covered the Supreme Court for a decade his new book is called the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court assault on the constitution\nDavid Kaplan welcome to fresh air so one of the main themes of your book is that the court has become so politicized you can predict tell each justice will vote it's become politics by another name elaborate on that idea for us\nWell on those hot button issues like abortion and same sex marriage and voting rights and gun control and campaign finance you pretty much know ahead of time where they're going to come out so the larger question I'm trying to asked in the book is whether the court ought to be as interventionist\nAnd as involved in American Life\nAs it is and enduring for example the recent Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings you heard questions about specific issues like abortion or presidential power but nobody asked\nWhether the court is properly involved in so many of these political and social issues because everyone pretty much assumes a that it ought to be\nIn what sense do you think that the court is overstepping\nThe court docket is almost entirely discretionary the justice to decide which cases they want to hear and too often\nThey choose to hear cases involving issues that I argue would better be left to the political branches got cheaply means Congress\nOr state legislatures and they do show for a variety of reasons but I I think the thread that runs through [noise]\nThe views of most justices most of the time and I interviewed a majority of them for this book\nThe attitude you get is if not us who will do show some will look out the window in pointed the capital\nAnd say look at the dysfunctional Congress they'll make references veil and otherwise to the presidency ah these days and that is a kind of arrogance that is remarkable to me I don't recall any part of the Constitution's stating\nHave that's [laughter] such dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias but you know his performance after Dr Ford testify\nTalking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for try to in Wall Street journal op ed piece I think that in some respects\nA leaves him\nIn an even tougher position than he might in a sexual harassment case there are a lot of cases that if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed huge true\nPartisan shelf in that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area\nWhat kind of cases you think that might influence\nWell you could imagine campaign finance\nAppeal coming up they're going to be more of those and depending on who brings it\nAnd are are there Republican interest or their democratic interest I think even if he's not in fact biased\nThe appearance of by a bias is a real one having said all that there are all kinds of reasons of course to criticize justice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so\nIn my book but I'm not sure you can point to a lot of cases in the area of of\nA sexual harassment or regulation of the workplace 'em and say that Thomas ruled the way he did out of ... or bitterness from his hearings back then\nI don't know if this was after last February or not that last February they lived in New York magazine cover story headlined the case for impeaching Clarence Thomas with stories of other women besides Anita Hill and had stories of sexual harassment ... um regarding Clarence Thomas [noise]\nYou know it's um it's a story that keeps you know coming back to life\nIt does and some folks could argue that maybe it was truly generous it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back\nTo light and as you point out now we've got two justices under a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts prestige\nBut one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act is 'cause they know that the justices across the street will act and I also think it it distorts presidential elections and the way that we saw in two thousand\nSixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament they didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become I'm President Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and Trump insulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault [noise]\nAre you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel beholden to Trump and therefore\nCome to conclusions in ways that support the Trump Administration when the Trump Administration is involved in a case\nI think they're all kinds of\nLegitimate bases for criticizing Cavanaugh I thought his testimony\nAfter Dr Ford was appalling I thought Kavanaugh's performance of the press conference the White House was a ... of a justice but I think the notion that now that he's on the Supreme Court he's gonna feel beholden to the president who appointed him is misguided one of the great aspects of the system\nWhich has lots of flaws is that once you're on the bench and have life tenure\nYou really don't have to look down Pennsylvania Avenue with any degree of loyalty because the president can't do anything at that point other than tweet so I think by and large most justices or throughout history have\nSuccessfully proclaimed and demonstrated their\nIndependence from the president's so pointed them look at the Nixon tapes case in Nineteen Seventy four were unanimous court ruled against Richard Nixon that doesn't mean you can't have a friendship\nWith the president and various FDR appointed justices remained friends with FDR butter on my list of criticisms of and concerns about\nBrett Kavanaugh the fact that he's grateful to this president I don't think will affect his decision making I think most justices most of the time once they're up there they're free and clear\nI hadn't known of Brett Kavanaugh before he was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice but you\nOf a potential nominees the one that the one that that ended with a course such nomination and you say some movement conservatives called Kavanaugh\nApproved ... milk toast to lack that and again this was before his nomination as was during the course hatched nomination why was he called ... toes to lacked got\nOh ... they would say he was such because of an opinion he wrote in one of the Obamacare cases where he didn't\nOut and strike down the statue which is what the movement conservatives won and instead\nHe said that his court the federal appellate court in Washington or should not be hearing the case deciding the case at that moment on procedural grounds there was a technical issue that we we ... I won't go into details on\nBut he wrote what I thought was a measured\nScholarly legal opinion saying the case isn't quite right for us it's a timing issue I thought it was a good solid opinion do I remember that doesn't matter but I think he was taken out to the woodshed by a lot of movement conservatives who said why didn't you do\nOr the right thing here and that was the chief strike\nAgainst him not happen to think that cabinet or on the court will wind up being less of the arch conservative that Thomas and Alito have been or that Gorsuch will be I Would predict the cabinet ... will veer closer\nTo what passes for the center of the court that chief justice Roberts is now the swing vote and I think he's institutional ism his affection for the court and for its own reputation may lead him in ... on some occasions\nTo rein in the courts power in the way that chief justice did decisively show\nIn the Obamacare ruling upholding the statute back in two thousand twelve I think Kavanaugh will\nVeer on occasion closer and then in that direction and for example Neil Gorsuch\nMy guest is David Kaplan former legal affairs editor at Newsweek and author of the new book about the Supreme Court called the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution we'll talk more after a break and Ken technical review singer songwriter could vials new album\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\n\nThen you about our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation [noise] support for NPR comes from this station and from progressive insurance [noise]\nI'll bring home quote explorer shoppers can evaluate options in one place when buying home insurance costs them closer than rates are available on line [noise] learn more progressive dot com [noise]\nAnd from logged me and makers of go to a meeting a collaborative meeting hot point over Eighteen million monthly use are designed to connect people from anywhere in the world\nOn any device learn more and go to meeting dot com [noise]\nThe White House says blaming the president for recent acts of violence is outrageous I'm Joshua Johnson has the rhetoric at rallies gone too far next time on one day\nThat starting at eight o'clock right here on the NPR News service of northwest public broadcasting [noise]\n\nFull of blue San Louis ... valley this Halloween evening looks like we'll get some rain so keep that I'm really handy generally gusty conditions tonight to closing the forty below fifty Thursday isn't even chance of rain and a bit breezy to goes to you with high temperatures in the mid fifties low sixties food for a rainy and windy friday then rain off and on through the weekend\nSupport for northwest public broadcasting jumps of listeners like you an artist and that that they would burn in Newtown eventually November include southern blues America on a musician Jeffrey folk Alton concert Wednesday November seventh and the barns thirteenth edible arts and craft ...

Sonia Sotomayor for example was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents for that or blame the Senate but I I think you in the first instance you need to blame the court because it gets involved\nSo often it raises the stakes of who sits\nOn the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues than you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role of a politics necessarily becomes heightened it wasn't\nAlways that way when John Paul Stevens was picked by Gerald Ford in the mid Nineteen seventies\nAnd it wasn't for that reason and I could give you half a dozen a dozen other examples those days are long gone I Would like to see the return of those days\nDo you think that ... a Supreme Court nominees ... include how Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee asking list nominated\nAnd and listen if the Democrats get control\nOf Congress ah this this time round or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together because they're not really good at playing dirty or you may see them raised the stakes you know they talk about ... about getting rid of life tenure at the Supreme Court that would require\nA constitutional amendment but if you want to increase\nThe size of the court pack the court as it were all you need is an act of Congress if the Democrats control the house from the Senate or the White House\nAnd twenty Twenty one I don't think\nCourt packing is off the table\nAt all and if you want to get back\nTo Merrick Garland seat and if you want to take back control of the court just add to more seats a point to liberals\nSupreme Court justice is I'm a lifetime appointment you leave when you say you want to leave and how old is your third Ginsburg now eighty five and how old was a\nDump all Stevens when he left Ninety\nYet so you didn't say for a really long time [noise] um so a lot of people already good it's a pretty good gig gig [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nUm so the lifetime appointment issue has been challenged by many people because now that people are living to such older ages than they used to when the Supreme Court was first created you know and when the constitution was first written\nUm the president's power to appoint a Supreme Court justice that's become a much bigger power than it ever was big cuts in part of the extension of\nThe lifespan of Americans [noise]\nUm so you know some people including you have proposed changing the lifetime nature of the appointment why do you think we should consider changing it and what are some of the suggestions you have [noise]\nWould lower the stakes of any particular\nNomination if for example there was a single term of Eighteen years as many\nOthers have suggested in which I endorse\nI think that would lower the temperature it would allow one shoe kicked in the system over time because she couldn't make current justices leave it would allow every president to get your nominations you'd have a new justice every two years I think that would be a great idea it will never happen [noise]\nUm I mean I think the most creative idea that I came across was not so much a single term but by staffing the Supreme Court randomly I'm with a rotating series of nine judges picked among the chief judges\nOf the twelve lower federal appeals court in the country\nIf it was just any bunch of judges picked and maybe it wouldn't be a nine of twelve maybe we'll be five of twelve venue might\nActually give forced to the idea that the court is a neutral body it rules based on law not personality not based on the political views of this or that justice but that these more anonymous lower court judges and the cheap\nMore like we have long imagined it to be the idea that the court is politicized is not\nA new issue it's just far more dramatic than it used to be and it cuts again what we all learned in civics class which is that the law is supposed to be neutral or government of laws not men and women and so forth I mean set all that any of these changes are incredibly unrealistic\nBut they have a cat and thank you so much for talking with us it's a pleasure thanks for having me David Kaplan is the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution\nAfter we take a short break Ken Tucker will review a new album I singer songwriter Kurt via this is fresh air singer\nSongwriter Kurt filed released his seventh album what a name Kurt bio here some of the album next [noise]\n\nGood evening recuperating things for tuning into the NPR News service of northwest public broadcasting on your Wednesday", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pullman", "day": "01"}
