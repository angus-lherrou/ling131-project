I guess that really do have consequences Flynn was fired selling was fired within days yeah yeah so you know\nSergei Kislyak telling Kislyak at the Trump Administration would lift sanctions sort of like don't worry about it a sanctions imposed by the Obama administration and these calls happened\nAfter the election but before the inauguration on right so how did how did you get onto this how did you start investigating ...\nWell I'm you know so\nAfter the post reported that about this secret CIA conclusion that Russia had in fact sought to help elect Donald Trump had had essentially had a candidate in the race\nAnd done what it could um to propel him to the White House I mean it just raised obvious questions about well what was Russia doing this for\nI'm On the other hand we're things happened that had never happened to me as a reporter um several of us started getting\nCards actual letters in the in the mail a thanks for readers from far away places um notes on on our on my doorstep at home I Would walk through the neighborhood and suddenly people would stop me and thank me and\nI mean that was that was felt great too and it was odd it was something I had never experienced\n[noise] let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is Washington Post reporter\nBrad Miller he covers intelligence and national security it's part of the team that shared a Pulitzer this year for national coverage his new book is called The Apprentice Trump Russia and some version of American democracy we'll be right back this is fresh air\nThe center of a story is not so easy to find when things are moving fast President Trump signed an executive works in a car shot at least weapon\nWas aimed at a network there will not be a government shutdown because every every afternoon NPR find the people and I did at the center of the story so you can understand what's happening what it means to you stand with facts into all things considered everyday\nListen to all things considered we dates from three to six thirty here on northwest public broadcasting\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us I guess is Greg Miller Washington Post reporter who covers intelligence and national security he shared a Pulitzer Prize this year and now he's written a new book called The Apprentice\nTrump Russia and it's a version of American democracy and it kinda brings together a lot of stories about candidate and President Trump and the Trump Administration stories that have been reported by Miller and other reporters at the Washington Post\nYou know you're right in the book that Trump has avoided consequences for offenses that were long considered politically fatal often by lying in the face of overwhelming evidence Flynn however had no such immunity I was interested that you use the word lying\nWeren't lying when used in the same sentence as Trump is very controversial in the journalism world because mine implied in tents\nIt's not you and you're saying it anyways so people are getting just weighing not worthy of using the word lie or not so easy to use the word lie so I Want to ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like um it is a difficult decision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the post for being\nToo reluctant to use that word and I think that's true with other news organizations as well but at the same time\nI mean we're here at this moment are you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post to his documented\nFive thousand or more fall swords from this president since he's taken office many of them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff\nTo um to correct his misstatements I mean there is an intense I don't think there's any doubt that there is an intent or that it is part of\nIt's part of Trump's per se contrary complex personality it's part of it and it traces back to his origin as a as a as a public person um I mean we have run fascinating stories here at the post about\nA times earlier in his career when he would adopt phony persona and call reporters for Forbes on the phone and try to lobby them into inflating his net worth for magazines in magazines annual rankings I mean there's a\nThere is an intense here and I don't have any doubt about that or or real any hesitation when appropriate from using the word lie [noise]\nAfter Flynn resigned under pressure you spoke to Devin Nunes has not Republican chair\nOf the house intelligence committee and you say that what he told you was basically the opening of what became an ongoing CJD by Trump and his allies to discredit the FBI what did he tell you\nThis is at a time when we're trying to figure out well we now know that Flynn had discuss sanctions would the Russians was basically cutting a deal behind his government's back with Moscow\nAnd not just raised a lots and lots of questions about well who else was in contact with with the Kremlin during the campaign if anyone right so we're we're digging by our news organization and many others and this was a conversation with the chairman of the house intelligence committee\nAnd I was asking him you know what else is there we are seeing lots of indications contact between Jared Kushner and ... and officials for Moscow and other members of the Trump Organization we already knew about Paul Manafort of course\nAnd he said that the FBI has been looking at this and all and it's all a dead trail and I pressed him because I could not believe that he was saying that there was already abundant evidence of contact that you could say that that was incidental and meaningless and harmless but you couldn't say it didn't exist but\nHe says it you know when I pressed him not even pizza boy deliberate contact\nAnd it just struck me at that time that that was\nSo implausible that he was you know he was trying to throw sand in our eyes basically uh in my eyes as a reporter he was trying to do um protect Trump and that that was um more important to him in that conversation that adhering to the facts that had already been established\nMy guest is Greg Miller who covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post and has written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and some version of American democracy we'll talk more after a break and TV critic David being currently looking center had the season premiere such

I'm not going to trust and not an an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are your own rules what are your guidelines for using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy at the post who those sources are so they can be confident and do any fact checking that's necessary [noise]\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really him in a really important one at this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources um for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources\nWe would really be unable I think to give our readers in the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U.S government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over again I Want one really saying on 'em at source the reporter knows who the source as it's the readers who are kept in the dark about the SARS but it's not like you know that's happening handling of the information\nThat's upstate right the sources are not anonymous to us\nUm these are sources that um we know who they are um many in many instances their sources we have known for many years and have developed trust in because of how reliably they have given us information um and you know\nAnd how we ended up having nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the with the publication of that story could have been two or three it's more about the caliber of the sources their their positions whether they have access to the information that they are providing\nA how trustworthy are they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that sourcing so sometimes you might be asked well what is the position of the ... where's the sourcing coming from from the story\nUm who are we talking about here and you can you can basically described their positions in government sometimes if it's highly sensitive senior editors are going to want to know\nMore they're going to want you to identify your source and that you know that sometimes can get a that can get touchy depending on the nature of your agreement with sore say or source be\nBut it's something you know ultimately despite you know we we all of these accusations and criticisms that's our reliance on anonymous sourcing\nI mean the the record just sort of holds up the stories that we've written over the past two years attributed mainly to anonymous sources have almost all proven overtime to be accurate I mean there might be mistakes at the margins here or there were\nA news organizations aren't perfect in and then can we do make mistakes but boy we've gotten a lot right um and I know Marty Baron executive editor at the Washington Post talks frequently about\nYou know the post and other news organizations um are always trying to get it right but at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news\nYou know there's extraordinary care given to getting the facts and even the nuance exactly right it it's really it would really be damaging to not just the Post's credibility in my credibility as a journalist but to the broader\nUm journalistic community if whenever we get things wrong there's a lot riding on the media right now in its ability to do its job and do it well and do it right let me try to give you one more example of\nThe reporting environment that we're trying to operate in just how much pressure we're under as reporters how much pressure our sources are under a as well um there came a time this past year when the Justice Department in Congress released the memos that former ...\nSomething happens troubles him he goes straight to his computer types up a mental to record would have would have transpired\nOne of those talks about a conversation he had with Trump in the oval office and most of the coverage about that memo focused on their interactions about what Trump wanted him to do in terms of backing away from the Flynn investigation but Trump has also complaining to call me in that in that setting\nAbout the leaks that are plaguing him at that point early in his administration\nHe's complaining about how people Howard news organizations learning what I'm saying into this phone and he points to the phone on his desk in the oval office\nHe's complaining about stories and he's talking as I read this memo I realize he's talking about me he's talking about the stories that I had written for the post\n... talking about yes I agree with you sometimes it's great to put somebody had on the pike as an example Trump goes on a joke about putting\nTrump goes on to put joke about putting were just said he believes reporters should be put in jail or in jokes about how once reporter spends a little time in jail to make a new friend suddenly they're willing to talk\nIt's a really disconcerting moment for anybody in journalism anybody who cares about journalism um but for me it it was just eerie um to to think that he's talking specifically about stories I had written for the Washington Post\nThey're talking about heads on pikes reporters in jail chasing down sources it was it was unnerving making afraid\nWell let me let me ... ... ...\nIt made me afraid I I was confident enough in my ability in in how I approach sourcing that I wasn't\nWorried about that I work for a news organization that has my back um and that's a good feeling but it is frightening in a way Terry and I remember talking about this at home um when I saw this memo describing this document to my wife and what was in it\nAnd our seven year old was at the table with us and he heard me talking about it and using words like jail and he's following this conversation and I maybe it was being too careless as a parent and bringing the subject up in front of him but he started to cry\nA he started to get really worried and asked whether\nWe're just trying to do our jobs um we're just trying to get to the truth we're trying to fulfill the role that the founders vision for for the media in this country and it's an important mission\nQuite Miller thank you so much for talking with us and thank you so much for your reporting\nThank you Greg Miller is the author of the new book The Apprentice Trump Russia and the soup version of American democracy he covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post\nAfter we take a short
