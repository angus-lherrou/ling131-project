[noise]\nThat was fifty years ago when NASA didn't have the computer technology we have today\nAnd that makes us access for moon landing even more remarkable my guess Damien says now directed the new movie the first man based on Neil Armstrong's life in the Nineteen sixties when he was an astronaut and took incredible risks to test new spacecraft and fly to them and\nI'm sure has played by Ryan Gosling who also starred in the movie musical Lala land which does al wrote and directed to that one the best director Oscar for that um he also wrote and directed whip\nPlayed by car east all I see

says are welcome back to fresh air and congratulations on first man you know my first reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and a moon luck what what [laughter] why would someone who's so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals\nMake a movie about ... an astronaut and space\nI Love the film but I was wondering when you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself being the right fit with it\nUh well you know I I myself I think had the the same sort of initial ah you know it it didn't really line up with the sort of films I'd been making art or kind of had to my mind but\nI think after thinking about it for a little bit and and during the region Hansen's a incredible book that the movie is based on it struck me as a story about dreams and uh and the cost of pursuing those dreams and you know that those are similar seem addict terrain at least two uh\nTwo whiplash in la la land and and uh but just on this kind of grand cosmic canvas seemed like if if I could tell that story and tracing you know the sort of journey from\nThe kind of intimate home life on the ground to destroy the extremes of human experience out in space I'm there could be some sort of through line that connected those um it could be really interesting\nInstead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capital of simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meat to kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors and for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it on that if the cameras\nPost production effects to ah to give that sense then then the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real shaking will be real even some of the terror will be real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight till uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the ah discovery intonation and just called jostling of all of that\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin Ryan in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to kneel and and Dave Scott you know uh [laughter] but we are right and I both wanted to try and make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody for our lap heart and question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to get a break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because ah he started to uh apparently you started to\nNot make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to a fast and I wonder we ain't getting ... from where we had to\nTake a we had to take a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second or his rights that type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of it himself as as you can\nDo I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and ah you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off and hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet but I guess at times like this is not climate at all inside the space caps on a recent lessons and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was putting space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void [laughter] you know that that that is a space\nI'm In juxtaposition with or just the crazy kind of noise making machinery that these capsules\nMe up Scotty space this is a this is creeping machinery kind of uh making its way up there so something like a\nLike to spend the sequence we were talking about you know certainly we want it to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of would augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually reminded audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nA little drones and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something better just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from them and right before the moon's right\nNASA prints together at a press state and about the death of the men on the flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\n'em and tell them you know they basically sending astronauts Africa space helping their land on the moon but if they don't they don't match is preparing you know basically a eulogy and ...\nUm get get that actually happened\nYeah I mean you can find the or ... you know you can search it online in a van of moon disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a\nAnd so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a caring Heinz who plays about Gilbert movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um [noise] uh that you can uh again you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to calculate in such a poetic beautiful way the\nWillingness to sacrifice and and this kind of a reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech that says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there's some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragic\nSort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel to do you know and what sort of a risky costly brave ventures could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil is Neil Armstrong new at NASA was writing has a ... [noise]\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about meal and and his colleagues is just how close to death they\nA live their lives sending seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots were astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to add or any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people\nI guess just ... he directed the new film first man and wrote and directed by land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break and light trucks will review a new set of young minds recordings of ... sweet I'm Terry Gross and fresh air\n[noise]\n\nThe new by our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from this station and from tire Iraq with more than five\nMeans budget and brand\nTire wrapped dot com helping drivers times delivered in stone\nFrom T.

starring Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong the first human to walk on the moon\nI Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think there's music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that\nWith this music he plays on the way to the moon things what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah\nSo it it's a less Baxter piece called lunar Rhapsody and what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes under the category about of of genre that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices Sarah man is incredibly like Florida piano if it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it pretty ... and having that kind of transcendent experience\nOf like being on your plate of the moon and plane was like really corny\nCorny version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it's just so strange I I as somebody you know the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\nI was a fascinated by you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I served learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked the track and I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself has to\nDo for it or you know are so little known there were also more famous ... music that ah that Neal and so the other astronaut to play during the course of their mission they played a piece from about divorce shock and awe\nThe ... or listen to two together that they loved together when they were young and loud and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nA in space and as I learned someone who was you know who was having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kinda unexpectedly\nPlay distracted really no one listening knowing image control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real can actually do except for the the person he lived except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving\nAnd felt like another way of of tying earth to the minimum you know time space and and the sort of cause most to ah\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nWell why don't we hear a little bit of that record that we've been talking about which is called minna Rhapsody [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThat's an interesting which Neil Armstrong played on the weight of the moon in ... in the new movie first manned missions directed by ... inches last not directed land and where did too and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and they found remarkable was that you were working on land before first man but a lot of them as a turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nI I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first man or and so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing\nYou know success and and uh through a lot of stops and starts in and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during or after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way I also hear ah you're into musicals you as a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\n[noise] so I'm finally what brings you to most joy and the most anxiety and during a movie like first man which they so much technical staff you had to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing um space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicating ... miniatures it it's just\nYou know raw land with a complex found but that's sort of like the choreography in a camera work and dreamy sequences this is like really difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean I think everything you described gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was a little bit the responsibility of the weight of history and I think particularly knowing that a\nA N and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they'd been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were uh uh going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they went to see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just to kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under myself and all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder to you know really get it right and pay proper tribute to ah to these people\nThey mentioned how thank you so much for talking
