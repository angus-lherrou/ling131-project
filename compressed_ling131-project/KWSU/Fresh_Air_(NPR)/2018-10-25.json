respond well to to to just violence ... violence sake you know that's not my um so what does make his way mesh\nWell blood actually and I think the older I get the worse it is actually it's not like something where you become more it actually becomes more on easy for me especially now being a parent's right like being the first breath of life taken\nAnd to watch life expire so easily again and

generated by recruiting sites in all these crazy ways\nYou know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year right and what does the money go\nThe money largely goes to the adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louis though which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out Thirteen scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year\nIt's just an coaches who make as much as a

Michael ... whose new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino is about a recruiting scandal in college basketball\nLast year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in scandal when these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news\nWere people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\n[noise] they absolutely were not shocked\nWhat the FBI did was put names and faces to what many people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock and what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing\nParents coaches and players and doing target\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be this is by the FBI and maybe looking at prison time that was a shock\nAnd has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\n[noise]\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\n\nYou know I mentioned that they do well and a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke which is quoted as saying this is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that\nBut the fact that coach case that it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and\nA determination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean\nSports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and at a certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe one of the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for particular programs\nAnd they're not real students their loyalty and their\nTheir responsibility is to their teen first\nWhich takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week\nAnd you're not paying them you know you were you were having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through not necessarily getting a degree coming out with some injuries and yet\nAnd everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nMe to come back to one thing you said earlier you said a lot of people knew that the shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations it as a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nI Do think it will make some difference but I think that difference will be\nAdjusted in the way that people\nConduct possibly criminal activity I think people will be more careful and you're already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them\nYou know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity\nI think they'll become more careful sunny the Cairo the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grass roots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy he also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone\nSo there's an element of all of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on the case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we covered this I mean ... you said that in some respects [noise] should apparel companies look pretty bad and is what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in these charges\nThe apparel companies have been very quiet they have put out sort of analysis statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet\nThere is a Adidas executive was one of the three current defendants his name is James ghetto\nHe's being represented by a lawyer hired by Adidas and finally James ghetto who's ... executive his father was a high school coach he's an insider he's a basketball insider almost all of these defendants are well liked well\nI think one of the scariest things for people in the basketball industry to the extent that that they are alarmed is\nThese people were them they were family they were part of the basketball fraternity and Adidas and Under Armour and Nike are part of the corporate basketball fraternity and I don't think they're planning on much to change either if they can help it\nMichael ... thanks so much for speaking with us thank you it's great to be on with you\nMichael ... new book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball we spoke yesterday later in the day in the first of three trials which sprang from an FBI investigation\nA federal jury convicted three men of conspiring to steer cash payments to get covered athletes and to top basketball
