able to return to the company the following year and then gave her final performance that fall at the age of forty seven\n[noise] retirement was inevitable even without the injury forty seven is considered old for a ballet dancer\nRetiring was a personal and professional crisis her life\nShe's lucky she can still dance in spite of the injury she sustained now she does contemporary dance\nTerry Gross interviewed Wendy Whalen in July of twenty Seventeen a little more than a year later and the New York city ballet begins its new fall season the dance company is confronting issues which to me too movement has brought into the light\nThis past January artistic director Peter Martin's resign from the company after denying accusations of sexual harassment and physical and verbal abuse he had led the company for over three decades\nAlso a scandal involving the sharing of sexually explicit photographs of women taking non consensual ally has forced the exits of three male

creature is now available on Netflix Wendy Whelan welcome\nTo fresh air I Know leaving the New York city ballet and is very difficult for you it had been your life your identity did it make it any easier to have a camera crew documenting that period of your life and being public about making it something interesting and worthy of sharing something other\nPeople dancers and other people would identify with\nA great question um it was a very difficult time I did not want to make the film originally when it came my way um I didn't want to share this very unknown I'm part of my life unknown to me um complicated and confusing and very vulnerable [noise]\nUm but it was sort of talked into it I I was talking to trying it and I liked the footage that I saw and I liked the directors and filmmakers that I was working with\nAnd that the ... the camera man he had done dance films before so it was very comfortable he knew exactly how to move in a studio or wherever I was with me and because it was such a difficult time it turn into supportive thing in a way it was\nAt times irritating to have a camera crew around me but at the same time it pushed me to bury myself open my story up um and to do it with confidence and to do it in a creative way\nWas it was it a kind of a preventive against the wall owing [laughter] ... I think it kind of turned into that yeah it was it was a support it turned into that anywhere\nCity name on climate and tell us thank you for tuning into an W ...

I didn't imagine it would be a terror and I couldn't do certain dances that season I did some I didn't do the ones I was really well known for and wanted to do\nAnd I waited a few months um didn't stretch it still danced but just at a certain level and then within\nThree months I could include for position\nAnd fifth edition and if you don't know ballet is the base of ballet it's the most basic position that everything moves from and I literally couldn't do that so that was a big shock\nAnd I tried everything I tried acupuncture I tried I was going to therapy I tried massage I tried everything you can imagine had injections\nUm MRI's I'm an MRI came back and said there were the inflammation in my head so I had my hip drained and\nThe doctor or also did an ultrasound and he said oh I see a complex labor will tear Scott tear what do you mean a tear how could I get a ... you know\nAnd I'm sure the tear it was there forever I just didn't know it and until it was covered and or had gotten to a place that it was um needing to be fixed [laughter]\nSo I contemplated surgery contemplated everything I could do to avoid surgery and ultimately about ... eight months later I was on the operating table getting reconstructive surgery\nThe doctor didn't know to what degree the hip injury was when I went into the surgery and I'm a one and a half hour or two hours surgery ended up being for hours\nIt was on crutches for two months and I was um [noise]\nVery often in a a machine that kept my uh the circulation going in my leg so that we could try to build new cartilage grown

to work properly again your body is your source [noise]\nAh the source of your pride the source of your work the source of your identity as a dancer and it's also just like your home I mean we all live in our bodies but your body it was like a very special body [noise]\nDefinitely it was my home it was my best friend [laughter] you know and we could talk we could fight and we always found way to make peace [noise] um throughout my career um\nYou know it started to tell me what to do and I stopped demanding from it\nSo I had to soften up and emphasize when my body and have a little more compassion for it and be grateful for what it did give me which was a phenomenal thirty year career was arguably the best company in the world\n[noise] you know a lot of people think of ballet as being um\nThe ultimate in like femininity in like [laughter] I think it's kind of femininity like really to to your approach in New York City ballet was some like more of an extreme sport I mean\nYou got your body into shapes and angles and doing jumps in getting lifted in ways that truly seems to defy the laws of gravity\nAnd defies the laws of what the body as physically capable of\nUm would you describe a little for people who have not seen you down some of the things that you did that we're we're so a typical for you but not typical for others [noise]\nRight [noise] well I can take it back

really good at drawing and I wanted I wanted to either grow up and be an athlete or an artist\nUnbeknownst to me ballet which both and again when I first saw the nutcracker\nThe dance that appeal to me was not the sugar punk very it was not the fault the flowers that was the Iranian dance it was the muscular or send us\nA more almost modern dance of the nutcracker that's the part I wanted to be I
