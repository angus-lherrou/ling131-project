Haskell welcome to fresh air and congratulations on being a finalist for the national Book Award Oh thank you so much Terry Gross [laughter] did you know out of your way for many years not to tell people that your mother had been a heroin addict\nOr throughout my childhood it's something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting like they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we're going to go in another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic [noise]\nAnd my grandfather he sent me down on the couch and he said it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she's a drug addict and that's that's why she's been gone all the time now that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I I trust that one friend my friend Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it's when you when you have these addictions and your family is I mean you sort of live this duality you you have this thing that that you should hold back from people and then you you put your best face forward um you know as I got older sometimes I Would share stories with people in high school somewhat\nBut it wasn't really until I delivered what I call an accidental Ted Talk in two thousand and twelve that I share the story more widely\nPeople must have asked you like kids must have asked you all the time like how can the grandparents are raising you as your parents\nThey would and I would just make up stories on my my father he he travels a lot for business or um you know I Would just you just find ways to to sort of deflect right to say it may be bad for my story telling skills began by by making up excuses for where my biological parents were\nYour mother was in jail and halfway houses your father you didn't even\nWritten about your childhood and your mother in the form of a graphic memoir for a young adult I Know I'm an adult and I really liked it I I Would recommend Mr adult right um why did you want to like target AT T on ... [noise]\nNo at the time I was in third grade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties\n[laughter] am I going to go back to school in Philly [laughter]\nAnd I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you cursed but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know [noise] um they smoke two packs a day each nah or and my grandfather just be moans this movement of ah\nHaving places be non smoking [noise] you know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience it to the point where you said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry\nNo smoke [laughter] he died of lung cancer you die yeah he died from well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's often a heavy smoker also heavy smoker and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and unfortunately she died ah she died on a friday or my wife's wedding shower was that Sunday\nAnd in the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time gene I'm now my wife should be over and and uh my ... my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen and we always had thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom and you know like\nYou know she's smoking right with the oxygen around her and oh it's oh gosh that's being as though they were so lucky the hosted and explode\nYeah still giving your grandparents were different people and they were raising you know when they were raising your mind\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was ah my my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had from my mother Leslie because\nThat took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front ah surely was also drinking a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young [noise]\nYou know had recurrent nightmare as as a child about monsters would you describe a nightmare\n[noise] this recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force and these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked\nMonsters they would freeze but the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters and so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around\nAnd make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping and every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I I vividly remember those dreams and yes they are in there in the book and and those were difficult to draw because um you know you writing out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make up words and make up sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but just catching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\n[noise] when do they stop these nightmares [noise] probably some time\nJust before high school I imagine I met remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school St building for all those nine years\nYour grandparents later tournaments that they often open up the bedroom door and find your sleeping right outside of um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone to any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly were the kind of people who thought you should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help uh you know distant ties you seeing someone is talking to somebody\nOn a professional level um and that's weird for me art was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\nWhen you took art classes and you're in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes because he knew how absorbed you more or less you're like you're drawing\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nHis is the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given\nYou know I thought I was gonna get extra credit I read the whole book and without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just add like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was ... that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles [noise] this is how you have to think\nAnd so he as an as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comical classes you know he he would just see these young people\nAre judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that a ... a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally at and it's in that moment uh and and back then this was the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAnd he tells you you had your own style a nation develop fat she did say that and that did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comics ... Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics with that that was actually useful for you\nIs certainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know that's the punches like really real back or the punches been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to be you know [laughter] real one is just have your own style [laughter] don't if you ignore everything about your [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J.

targeted a that's terrible but it it it is interesting now to to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nSo how did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress and be theater like a human being and haven't beat the washed up star of the family ...\nWell the idea for the show really started from my friendship at least ... who was a brilliant illustrator and cartoonist and I have been friends with her since high school and when I was you know in Los Angeles pitching shows around\nUm she was living in Brooklyn at the time and one thing she was doing was drawing these animal people on her own and posting them in her blog and on the Internet and I thought they were just so gorgeous ...

you wrote it I'm an unusual episode because it's one long monologue ... mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dimension and low jak does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at a Mike her coughing at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both Maine to bow jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a brief part of his eulogy and just as well or not as Beau jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called ... around seriously though hold your applause will\nHeld it was written by my friend her 'cause as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named ...\nAnd it was about these wars and an early on the network at a new maybe don't mention their orphan so much because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted something to long for\nAny way we did this one season finale we're Libya's birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got her so quickly\nTogether and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted and anyway the horse to water be careful moms have a way of letting you down but Libya just thinks the horses jealous and when the mom says she's moving to California Bolivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced the cliffhanger ... gone for good\nWith of course because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother at a relapse and had to go back to rehab facility had hits like all the way home getting rides from Mr T.

you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um she would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of men that were shipped\n'em we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah as happy Halloween because it's missing an end to the misfit toys or why um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWith the disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... senators at my living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it's not like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated [laughter] now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes\nUm and\nIt's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage\nUm and that's been very scary to me\nUh but also scary how little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening um especially big some for someone who you know\nAs the Julian hear the story of the Holocaust is over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who are shocked when their own neighbors\nStarted you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAre you now officially one of the Jews control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey had a ... and ...\nUm and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the story that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nShe was a difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes\nYou know I I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested in me I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in and there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed\nWhere it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took her pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience that I Love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too was I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nKnow anyone that's inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize what an appropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy here pushing the boundaries I did because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified\nThat oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just\nA shouting out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's\nA ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it and I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay [noise] I\nFor me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not oh you have this thing there for you or this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this\nPrecisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps and what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat was to me like a safe space for you or you could like unless yourself on TV and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of\nWhat you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like there's so many pop culture references and bow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and they happened so quickly you can barely like catch them around [noise]\nUm so it made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there is a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here\nBut on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it\nRight even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely was a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh\nFrom an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this theme that I was living in feel like the scenes but I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful as being a writer and having an outlet and now\nIf I Am in a situation I think if the funny thing\nI can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and a lot of a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it's a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting it in a story later so having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central is running bow jak which is Netflix series now the comedy central is rain yet starting with season one um what's that like for you because\nYou in retrospect ... like some of the jokes in season one where\nYou know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks\nOr the right time for Comedy Central and you know obviously want them to keep their dignity as an episode of television not edited out have you been to a park and bad we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this work without this moment\nAnd if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out um but I also saying look this is the show and\nIt has to do exist on its own terms and hopefully people you know as they have embraced showing Netflix will embrace the show on Comedy Central and if there are flaws with it they will be those laws for what they are and you know we'll see what happens\nWhen it's been great to talk with you thank you so much\nIt was my pleasure thank you so much\n...
