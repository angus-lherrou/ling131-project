to believe when a woman says she was sexually assaulted by someone she knows behind a closed door and the men denies that\nThat's an issue university is I've been grappling with my guest Vanessa glory on us is the author of blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nEighty administrators and experts and read dozens of case reports\nShe says that while writing the book she witnessed a historic moment when survivors moved from the shadows to the spotlight first on campus and then nationwide with the me too movement glory out as as a contributing editor at the New York times magazine in Vanity Fair and has won a national magazine award\nVanessa group gory audits welcome to fresh air you know you're writing a book that there's a new understanding of what rape and sexual assault means that started on college campuses but with me too movement it spread beyond campuses\nWhat Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation tell you about how far that new understanding has spread\nI guess what I'm asking you is this if if the Republican senators and the Judiciary Committee\nHad gone to college campuses\nWhat'd you think some of the things are they would have been told about ... what to take into consideration\nBefore voting things that they might not have thought of in part by as the Republicans on judiciary were men a lot of them are older men if you know their college days were very different in terms of thinking about sexual assault\nYeah if so senators had um ban on college campuses as presidents or administrators are title nine officers they would have had a completely different set of questions right because they would have already known what college campuses no about sexual assault which is\nVery few women make it up\nVery few women are excited to get there and report and feel like the sister moment in the limelight\nSomething like not having reported for many years is not a big deal most sexual assault survivors and don't actually report for awhile\nAnd they wouldn't know that they might not actually get a lot of evidence because there's very rarely good evidence and\nMany of these cases particularly those that happened thirty six years ago so they have to look at the credibility of each person [noise]\nLast Tuesday while the FBI investigation with still going on\nInto Brett Kavanaugh's President Trump spoke to reporters on the south lawn of the White House before boarding a flight this was October second and so this this was before the Senate voted on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court\nWhat is your view of things that you may not be guilty which is a very very very difficult time [noise]\nWhat's happening here has much more to do that even the appointment of a bridge or just [noise]\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Vanessa ... is author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years\nYou were talking to people on college campuses [noise]\nThere was a huge shift and the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um\nMany students said to me that they weren't sure is groping counted as sexual assault maybe it has to be penetration 'em by the end of the three years that idea was completely blown up the water\nAnd I even had students pay to me you know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you abreast on people in speech and\nMake them feel like justice uh like dirty like a sexual objects I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually takes us [noise]\nSo um it is there no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that\nUm people who are enlightened about this as you understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that part of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue\nIs that we don't have a national definition [noise] so\nUm you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there's a huge difference something like gas means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to talk to somebody now\nI guess you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose\nLooking at us in researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I can convinced that this is a really good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly\nWho's in a workplace who might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question that you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why were you\nResistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means faxes something days ... book and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people nuts part of the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that a question is not that big a deal\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condo which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question\nI'm there really has to be an extra question\n... you read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is that it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness Winnie me\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls don't always saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing your way right they say well maybe another time\nUh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until band up giving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to\nFix this problem is about girls understandings signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves\nIt's really hard to get out well you know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like rules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever\nUm but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person having the full burden of the awkwardness exactly so this is a little\nDorky okay ... ... it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party like to go out and dance at night recently you know guys try to come up and down with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said\nIs it okay if I put my arm around here and I said no [laughter] no I'm In one of his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent I'm I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I\nWas that the first time that happened here that was definitely a first for me I mean I ... yeah I I didn't think that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him Mary and\nI'm I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so\nI think that's a great thing to have that happen and to have young girls who truly

Kennedy of how she pronounces it I'm not so I I was in I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did a newer version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line and we'll a Jackie Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people but kidnap models and force them to eat their make up a model of themselves\nDrag just weird dried but with no way gone because we were trying to\nEven offend I guess drag queens at the time by not taking it seriously\nAnd he starts looking through all these Jacqueline Kennedy magazines but there were many off at the time a fan magazines and he starts to imagine themselves as Jacqueline Kennedy in the Kennedy assassination and we have the whole thing a capital case I mean up pitiful version\nBut we have a chef for our we have 'em all the people that were in the car we have Secret Service agents\nAnd I'm divided waving to the crowds are no crowds that was filmed on my parents' street and lose his own Maryland I'm Maurice avenue and a\nAnd a and then it is scored to classical music where there's one note that as a gunshot and divine crawled out of the trunk of a car with the blood and everything and it's quite graphic but it was filmed so primitive later that's a nice way to say badly I'm black and white ah\nSixteen millimeter grainy over expose that when I took pictures on the twenty five thirty years later it began to look like the ... film the one of the most famous eight millimeter movies ever\nSo um I I I did a a photo peace based on that pictures of something I did a long time ago and it goes around the wall around the corner of the wall because I I always joke than I Am a Carney while I Believe in the world is that the frame is the hype to frame as the advertising campaign\nSo to me it was too big for one wall to go around the wall\n[laughter] I'm In ... for any of our listeners who aren't familiar ... design shown that you're referring to play against Kennedy design was a very heavy man who who usually played a woman Indian movies and hot and himself and some of those rules on unless you get him\nAnd and what do you think of we'll drag queens at the time\nWhether they were square at the time you know I think ... divine helped make drag queens allow Hitler they all wanted to be best Myers and\nSo it was they were really square they worship ever\nNow all drag queens or I mean you see 'em at Woodstock and they're all really found in a sense of humor and they have funny names and everything\nBut but then they were very very serious I remember in Philadelphia there's a great movie called the queen about a drag beauty contest in Philadelphia oh I Know where where you live and Harlow was the winner and I'm very very famous\nA drag queen but but we used it must have coffee who was\nHumor about it and used to being a drag queen of as being um comedy terrorist which I think um was much more useful in film than than just a man trying to be a pretty woman\n[noise] you know early in your career you said that you work is really about the sadness normal people feel because they're not involved in show business [laughter]\nSo what he said that was the ... thing I ever since I didn't mean to be some money\nBut I Believe that most everybody's secretly imagines himself in show business at every day on their way to work for a little bit depressed because there are people are sad they're not famous America [laughter]\nI guess you really needed to be famous\n[laughter] um well I I I certainly can't complain about it\nHate to hear people that are in show business to complain about any of that kind of thing well what on earth did you pick that field to go in for it if you didn't want people to recognize you I've I've always said that show business is filled with the most insecure people of all that\nThat we base a life on having to get approval of strangers from everything we do over and over and over on each project\n[noise] you know in your book there's a lot of skills of movies and I'm not the skills from movies that were transplanted in their time or you know violating some taboo in some small way [laughter]\nYou also have to fail ... yeah but you also have a couple of photos of of ... the clowns and howdy Doody not not known as the most but okay\nNext Clara Bell yes he was psychotic locking them was the first thing that I was on the how to do to show my parents took me I was on the peanut gallery at NBC Studios Clara Bell was a psychotic clown who never spoke who honked horns and shot you in the face with seltzer water\n'em and you know captain kangaroo in clear about what the same person imagined that life\nI think ...
