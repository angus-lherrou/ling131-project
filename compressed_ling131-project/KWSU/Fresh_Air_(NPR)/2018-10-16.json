know when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was\nA lot of jealous when my mother stopped is that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had from my mother Leslie because\nThat took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always at a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front ah surely was also drinking a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young [noise]\nYou know had recurring nightmares as a child about monsters would you describe a nightmare [noise]\nThis recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monstrous my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but then of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I've I've vividly remember those dreams and yes there in there in the book and and those were difficult to drop because um you know you writing out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make up words and makeup sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these pieces nightmares or you're facing these people once again\n[noise] when do they stop these nightmares [noise]\nProbably some time just before high school I imagine I'm ... I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school same building for all those nine years\nYou know grandparents later told you to turn it off and open up the bedroom door and find your sleeping right outside of um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't\nThirty would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help a distant ties you seeing someone who's talking to somebody\nOn a professional level um and that's where for me art was such a saving grace because uh I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawn\nWhen you took art classes when you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these crimes that he knew how to absorb July when if you're drawing\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have their reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nHis is the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I pride in this book was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just add like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was that the that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles [noise] this is how you have to think\nAnd so she as an as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comical classes you know he he would just see these young people\nAre judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally and in that moment uh and and back then this was now the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own ... somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that is a possibility\nAny tells you you had your own style a nation develop fat he did that I said but did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comics\nCertainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know the the punches like really real back or the punch has been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know are there still a lot of value on that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw books I think Paige wants to be you know real one is just have your own style [laughter] donate you ignore everything you're about\nMy guest is Jared J.
