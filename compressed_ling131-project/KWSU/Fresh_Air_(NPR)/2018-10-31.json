I'm claim I tend to LA it's seven ... thank you for making like less public broadcasting a part of your Tuesday [noise]\nThis is fresh air and Terry Gross\nMy guess Jonah Hill became famous for playing a high school student in the comedy super that that was just one of his comedy films along with a forty year old virgin knocked up and funny people that was produced and or directed Baghdad appetite\nBall and the wolf of Wall Street this year he co starred in the ... film don't worry he won't get far on foot and he starts with Emma Stone and then the Netflix series maniac\nJoni how just made is directing debut with the new film mid nineties which he also wrote it's about a subculture skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties the period when Jonah Hill was a self described not great skate border but hung out with a group of much better skate boarders\nThe film isn't autobiographical but it draws on his memories\nThe film was told from the point of view of a boy played by the eleven year old son ... who wants to be a skateboard or and be accepted by the older skaters he admires the take life threatening risks with skate tricks and stunts\nAnd spend the rest of their time smoking drinking and trash talking the skaters are played by pros but the skaters they play are unlikely to get anywhere they have no money no connections\nJonah Hill welcome to fresh air congratulations on a movie with skateboarding mean to you when you were in your teens\n[noise] I'm no ambassador for skateboarding and skateboarding so sensitive to being portrayed in film by outsiders\nAnd that's understandable because it's often butchered but when I was maybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a real sense of especially more in my early teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home\nAnd I think a lens that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um [noise] the treatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness I dunno just laid an imprint on me\nSo I'm the group uh skaters who you were friends with our aspired to be friends with what was that culture like\nIt was a lot of different things you know I Would always terrible I always wanted to be great I think I still would trade a lot of achievements for certain skateboarding achievements that just I don't think are physically possible for me at this point at thirty four I filmed a lot of ...\nOf that you're in like you weren't going to be as great skateboard are but you can you know I got great okay\nI loved it and it was [noise] they're such bombastic personalities such twisted sense of humor now\nYou know a lot of what I think what's great about it and what are things that I had to and people from that time had to unlearn what are some you\nFelt you had to learn from that culture the\nWay people spoke to one another and what they said to one another especially in regards to homophobia and toxic masculinity\nLike there's a scene where um the kid in a movie says to the flight noted had thank you and the other kids had a gay he can't say that and then he start\nEven though this isn't my story I wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through community even if that Comey is has the flaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any\nThat for this kid it's still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up and I learned some of this stuff\nWould you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now [noise]\nAh yeah I Dream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot in my life to be able to do certain tricks\nFor aggression they use the word dream what'd you unreality [laughter] ever considered an escape or now\nI landed a kicks foot in front of our cast and crew in order just a out of being so exciting exhilarated by everyone skating but be to just prove that this is something that at one point was a massive part of my life\n[noise] let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is Jonah Hill and he's just written and directed his first film and it's called mid nineties and as you can tell from our conversation it's set among a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties\nWe'll be right back and we'll talk about some of the films he starred in after the break this is fresh air [noise]\nThis year Americans are voting early often record turnout in some states as as high for the midterms as it is for a presidential race so far about Eighteen million Americans have voted early what might that tell us about the results devoting explosion across America next time on one\nYou can hear one day and about forty minutes from eight to nine right here on your NPR News service northwest public broadcasting [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Jonah Hill and he's known for starring in\nMovies like Superbad money ball and the wolf of Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all those Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting then\nWould you be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early ...\nHere's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly [noise]\nOn my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter of certain thoughts [laughter] but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I have seen the godfather to really young age 'cause it's my dad's favorite movie and I wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten and then I think is a I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the characters in The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old\n[laughter] who is\nMarge was Don Corleone because at the nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer\nSo she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the Don no excuse me she's Michael Sallah OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is done he dies right away though so Marge is Michael way to Homer fan\nNo Homer see that would be but I Would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is\nA K [laughter] like Diane Keaton like [laughter] where are you going to go legit you know [laughter]\nBut uh Lenny and Carl homers friends from work were Lenny was frayed auto and Carl was sunny and\nKnow I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the and fishing or the or\nOr even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who\nTend to think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because [noise]\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film like I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there is imagining it on the corner and they're out another place or something [noise]\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this I mean most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to\nLucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange well Kansas all about kids similar to the kids in your money\nAnd it's the seminal movie in my life came to the huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids where kids it's so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burning the world down\nAnd this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope even if it's dysfunctional connection and hope\nAnd those are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it um a friend of mine who ... who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York\nI completely was too young to understand the aid strep plot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot murdered themselves couldn't win over my head so I just took wow this is the first day of and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I thought clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] I mean just her and her and I need to talk to [laughter] it's like\nYou know like a laughing when he was tell them that I just obeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to them about what I had seen what shape you also asked about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was too heavy so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents had a ... [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realized they were trying their best I think ultimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and\nI think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well I guess this Jonah Hill he wrote and the ...\nAfter a break and Marie encouraging will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American whose murder and Nineteen fifty five in Mississippi galvanized the civil rights movement I'm Terry Gross and this was fresh air [noise]\nKnew about our family foundation supports WHYY is fresh air and its commitments are sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station [noise] I'm from western hotels and resorts western has committed to the wellbeing of travelers with offerings like having a bad a super foods are ex menu and gear lending for one workout gears left behind at home [noise]\nWest and let's rise learn more western dot com [noise] and from the NPR wine club where members receive NPR inspired wines like weekend edition cabernet\nAnd wait wait don't tell me Murillo available to adults\nTwenty one years or older learn more at NPR One club dot org thank you for tuning into northwest public broadcasting on your Tuesday evening here support is greatly appreciated and helps make programs like fresh air possible [noise]\nI'm Clay Martin tell us it's just about seven thirty stay tuned for more with Jonah Hill\nPulled up loose and Louis ... a series of bad weather systems move across the region through the weekend there was a good chance of rain overnight was throwing the mountains emotionally upper thirties to low forties Halloween has rained likely during the day Halloween Night itself looks like you could get more rain so keep it on broad handy when I asked him on the upper forties to mature to use\nThis program is here on northwest public broadcasting thanks in part to Howard Hughes appliance and protests auto repair their support and donations from listening is like you enabled us station to bring you programs that engage in lightening entertain every day you can become support or two at N. W. P. B. dot org ...\nIn films like Wolf of Wall Street and Moneyball [noise] how did you get the word out to film directors that you were interested in making the transition to more dramatically [noise]\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part and Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John ... told me [noise]\nAnd then and Catherine Keener and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and cast me money ball\nAnd then in the interim a\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun\nAnd then\nI knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy uh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy just doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am and\nI have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols are buried lemon center people got started on comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life\n[noise] why don't we hear a scene from a Wolf of Wall Street which was directed by Martin Scorsese and\nWritten by tyrants winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this is a movie that I'm I'm based on the story of Jordan Bell Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes\nAnd eventually went to jail for for fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he's approached by Donny Adolf played by you who eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting\nUm so you start the scene [noise]\nDo for them to actually I just you know call\nMean I think we live in [noise]\n... ...\nIt's a little kid and frankly was [laughter] what do you do for\nFor quality to\nJones front of you sort of [noise] there's a lot of money [noise]\n\nHow much money [noise]\nOn Seventy thousand last month [noise]\nI'm Serious officers to almost one [noise]\nFor hold you come into the technically Seventy two thousand [noise]\nShe'll be pissed off for Seventy two thousand dollars I quit my job right now and I worked for you [noise]\n\nNo yeah it was fun it was when I quit and he quit his job\nWhich I thought it was a little weird I mean I just met the\nGets out of a business or well the things about him to like phosphorus white T I got to deal with your wife back the dorm rooms with clear lenses just look more walks\n[laughter] okay so that's the thing that Leonardo DiCaprio and my guess Jonah Hill\nFrom the wolf of Wall Street um what did you learn from working with Martin Scorsese on also philosophy\nHonestly so many things I guess the main lesson I learned\nWas that it's okay not to judge your characters to just show their behavior as people and the characters in his films often do really ugly things and you still find humanity in them\nAnd I like how\nUnabashedly an unapologetically he shows human behavior for better or worse\nWhich is something you've tried to do when you're in a movie [noise]\nWhich is I think something that really speaks to me in art in general and something I'm going to strive to do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and something that I tried to do in mid nineties if we don't want to be back to The Simpsons I mean homework I\nWas a terrible father right I really terrible father can be viewed but he also is really loving big hearted\nPerson right so you know it's like I guess I'm interested in the gray area\nSo this weekend this Saturday you going to host Saturday Night live\nWhen you hosted in twenty fourteen and it's the sketch that most took me by surprise and when I say me I mean me personally so you played a six year old who's with step mother\nAt a ... hunter restaurant seated at a communal table and you're you're acting like this like six year old insult comic with all the insults directed at your stepmother Dr Debbie Wasserstein has played by NASA bear and she's trying to make you stop [noise]\nInappropriate inappropriate you listening to NPR over my nightmares will take place here in stock Terry Gross [noise]\nMaybe consider not listening and I want to train whistle every once in a while [noise]\nOkay and you say [laughter] I was shocked and in light of the name check them on the show [laughter]\nThere's so many layers to why that is humorous to hear this moment\nI was just so funny um I think the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like\nHe like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that he has to listen to NPR incredibly boring to a kid even though he's so aware to talk about the show with such detail and understanding\nBut that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first I'm this'll be my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was probably like twenty three or something [noise] um [noise]\nAnd I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader and Eddie Sandberg and I think a ... oh Seth Meyers was there and\nA bill Hader and told a story about a going to a Benny ... in his home town and there was a kid who he couldn't tell whether the kid was like six or like forty [laughter] and\nWhen the when the chef did his trick the kid lean back in clapped his one hand against the table almost like Tony Soprano style and I think I just started\nDoing the kid is if you will like an old Catskills comedian and then that's where when I got there a few weeks later we were like oh we should try that as a sketch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times\n[noise] well Tony hill thank you so much for coming on the show it's

News service northwest public broadcasting on your Wednesday afternoon\nWestern Washington looking a big gray with possible showers and a brief highs and the fifties you food cascades cloudy with a chance of showers has also in the fifties [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air I'm Terry Gross the Supreme Court has changed during the Trump Administration the court now has to Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch who replace the late Antonin Scalia after Mitch McConnell block President Obama from choosing Scully a successor\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh who replaced Anthony Kennedy after Kennedy retired\nNow the chief justice John Roberts is also considered the most likely swing vote in a court that has five conservative justice is\nMy guest David Kaplan says the court has reached the point where justices are often seen as political proxies of the Republican or Democratic Party\nHis new book is about how the court became so politicized and so powerful\nThat also includes profiles of several of the justices the book is based in part on ... interviews with several of the current justices as well as past justice is sixty five law clerks who worked at the Supreme Court and congressional and White House officials dating back to the Reagan Administration [noise]\nA lot of the interviews were done on the condition that he not named the source Kaplan is also a former legal affairs editor at Newsweek where he covered the Supreme Court for a decade his new book is called the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution\nDavid Kaplan welcome to fresh air so one of the main themes of your book is that the court has become so politicized you can predict how each justice will vote it's become politics by another name elaborate on that idea for a\nWhile on those hot button issues like abortion and same sex marriage and voting rights and gun control and campaign finance you pretty much know ahead of time where they're going to come out so the larger question I'm trying to asked in the book is whether the court ought to be as interventionist\nAnd as involved in American Life as it is and during for example the recent capital confirmation hearing\nBut he asked whether the court is properly involved in so many of these political and social issues because everyone pretty much assumes a that it ought to be\nIn what sense do you think that the court is overstepping the\nCourt docket is almost entirely discretionary the justice to decide which cases they want to hear and too often they choose to hear cases involving issues that I argue would better be left to the political branches that cheaply means Congress\nOr state legislatures and they do so for a variety of reasons but I I think to thread that runs through [noise]\nThe views of most justices most of the time and I interviewed a majority of them for this book I interviewed the background I can indicate which ones I interview that was the terms of the deal I the attitude you get is if not us who will do so some will look out the window in pointed the capital\nAnd say look at the dysfunctional Congress they'll make reference is veiled and otherwise to the presidency ah these days and that is a kind of arrogance that is remarkable to me I don't recall any part of the Constitution's stating\nSuch dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias by you know his performance after Dr Ford testify\nTalking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for or try to in the wall Street Journal op ed piece I think that in some respects\nA leaves him\nIn an even tougher position than he might into sexual harassment case there are a lot of cases it if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed huge true\nPart is and shelf in that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area what kind of cases\nYou think that might influence\nYou could imagine campaign finance\nAppeal coming up they're going to be more of those and depending on who brings it\nAre are there Republican interest or their democratic interests I think even if he's not in fact\nBiased the appearance of by a bias is a real one having said all that they are all kinds of reasons of course to criticize justice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so in my book\nBut I'm not sure you can point to a lot of cases in the area of of\nA sexual harassment or regulation of the workplace 'em and say that\nThings back then\nI don't know if this was after last February or not but last February there was a New York magazine cover story headlined the case for impeaching Clarence Thomas with stories of other women besides Anita Hill and had stories of sexual harassment ... um regarding Clarence Thomas [noise]\nSo it's um it's a story that keeps you know coming back to life\nIt does and some folks could argue that maybe it was truly generous it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back to light and as you point out now we've got two justices\nUnder a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts prestige\nI think it helps to uh in feeble Congress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act is 'cause they know that the justices across the street\nWill act and I also think it it distorts presidential elections in the way that we saw in two thousand\nSixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become\nI'm President Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and Trump consulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault are you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel beholden to Trump and therefore\nCome to conclusions in ways that support the Trump Administration when the Trump Administration is involved in a case\nI think they're all kinds of legitimate bases for criticizing Cavanaugh I thought his testimony\nAfter Dr Ford was appalling I thought Kavanaugh's performance of the press conference the White House was a not a fitting of a justice but I think the notion that now that he's on the Supreme Court he's going to feel beholden to the president who appointed him is misguided one of the great aspects of the system\nWhich has lots of flaws is that once you're on the bench and have life tenure you really don't have to look down Pennsylvania\nTweet so I think by and large most justices or throughout history have successfully proclaimed and demonstrated their\nIndependence from the president's so pointed them look at the Nixon tapes case in Nineteen Seventy four were unanimous court ruled against Richard Nixon that doesn't mean you kind of a friendship\nWith the president and various FDR appointed justices remained friends with FDR butter on my list of criticisms of and concerns about Brett Kavanaugh the fact that he's grateful to this president I don't think will affect his decision making I think most justices most of the time\nOnce they're up there they're free and clear\n[noise] I hadn't known of Brett Kavanaugh before he was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice but you're right that some people some insiders were surprised that he wasn't on\nTrump's first list of a potential nominees the one that the one that that ended with of course such nomination and you say some movement conservatives\nCalled Kavanaugh\nApproved ... milk toast to lacked guts and again this was before his nomination as was during the course that nomination ... toes to lacked that\nOh if they would say he was such because of an opinion he wrote in one of the Obamacare cases where he didn't reach out and strike down the statue which is what the movement conservatives wanted instead he said\nThat his court the federal appellate court in Washington or should not be hearing the case deciding the case at that moment on procedural grounds there was a technical issue that we we don't I won't go into details on but he wrote what I thought was a measured\nScholarly legal opinions saying the case isn't quite right for us it's a timing issue I thought it was a good solid opinion do I agree with that doesn't matter but I think he was taken out to the woodshed by a lot of movement conservatives who said why didn't you do\nOr the right thing here and that was the chief strike\nAgainst him not happen to think that Kavanaugh on the court will wind up being less of the arch conservative that Thomas and Alito\nHave banned or that Gorsuch will be I Would predict that cabin all will be a closer to what passes for this\nSome his affection for the court and for its own reputation may lead humans on some occasions to rein in the courts power in the way that chief justice did decisively so\nIt'd be Obamacare ruling upholding the statute back in two thousand twelve I think Kavanaugh will\nBeer on occasion closer and then ... in that direction and for example Neil Gorsuch\nMy guest is David Kaplan former legal affairs editor at Newsweek and author of the new book about the Supreme Court called the most dangerous branch

legal affairs editor at Newsweek\nSo we have to Trump appointees on the Supreme Court now Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh Justice Scalia who was replaced by Gorsuch or wasn't originalist\nWhich means are interpreting the constitution as it was intended to be interpreted by the founders when it was written\nAnd not considering it a document that has to be updated for the times that we live in and Thomas considers himself an originalist or a texture lest I say that not really understanding the difference between those two\nTerms but um is Gorsuch or Kavanaugh an originalist or texture list or do they not subscribe to that point of view\nI think they were both call themselves card carrying originalists and to some extent touch was having said that I'm In my book originalism is bunk\nBecause even original is only use originalist originalism when it suits them when it doesn't suit them they ignore it I think it's a lot of nonsense and of course the most important thing about the whole original is a a trope\nIs that if you look at the constitution and I've read mine a lot\nThere is no causing the constitution that says Val show interpret me\nBased on what you thought those who wrote me two hundred and fifty years ago thought it's nonsense\nWas something you say about originalism is that because you're trying to literally follow what the founding fathers meant when I wrote the constitution at a time when there was slavery at a time when women did not have equal\n... and it tends to favor the halves of that time and to this favor all other such as minorities and other unpopular lead against and maybe we can add women to that\nAll true but of course the constitution is not written as a set of regulations some constitutions the world are written that way when you use phrases like a equal protection of the laws or due process of law\nOr no unreasonable searches and seizures when you write things such general terms you necessarily are inviting those who interpret you whether they are judges or presidents or senators\nI'm to use their own judgments as to what it means that's why you write a constitution\n[noise] do you think that justice is in general have become more politicized in recent years than they've been in the past yes okay why do you think that is\nI think in part because the selection process that we use now and the better if more cynical\nA process that White House is used to pick nominees results in such candidates you know the Brett Kavanaugh is a competent judge show was Neil Gorsuch but they weren't chosen because of their Stella credentials those were unnecessary requirement for getting chosen\nThey were chosen because I thought they vote the right way\nIn the same way I think that Ruth Bader Ginsburg was chosen by Bill Clinton and the ... son just started my are for example was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents for that or blamed the Senate but I I think you in the first instance you need to blame the court because it gets involved\nSo often it raises the stakes of who sits\nOn the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues then you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role of a politics necessarily becomes heightened it wasn't\nAlways that way when John Paul Stevens was picked by Gerald Ford in the mid Nineteen seventies and it wasn't for that reason and I could give you half a dozen a dozen other examples those days are long gone I Would like to see the return of those days\nDo you think that ... ... um Supreme Court nominees\nComing to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nAbsolutely and and listen if the Democrats get control\nOf Congress ah this this time round or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together because they're not really good at playing dirty or you may see them raise the stakes you know they talk about why about getting rid of life tenure at the Supreme Court that would require\nA constitutional amendment but if you want to increase the size of the court pack the court as it were all you need is an act of Congress if the Democrats control the house and the Senate or the White House\nAnd twenty Twenty one I don't think court packing is off the table\nAt all and if you want to get back\nThe Merrick Garland seat and if you want to take back control of the court just add to more seats a point to liberals than an eleven member court ever six by majority do I think that's possible yes\n[noise] being a Supreme Court justice is I'm a lifetime appointment you leave when you say you want to leave and how old is your third against but now eighty five and how it was a\nJump off Stevens when he left\nNinety yeah so it's I mean you can say for a really long time [noise] um so a lot of people already ... it's a pretty good gig gig [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nUm so the lifetime appointment issue has been challenged by many people because now that people are living to such older ages than they used to when the Supreme Court was first created you know when when the constitution was first written\nUm the president's power to appoint a Supreme Court justice that's become a much bigger power than it ever was big cuts in part of the extension of\nThe lifespan of Americans [noise]\nUm so you know some people including you have proposed changing the lifetime nature of the appointment why do you think we should consider changing it and what are some of the suggestions you have [noise]\nWould lower the stakes of any particular nomination if for example there was a single term of Eighteen years as many others have suggested in which I endorse I think that would lower the temperature it would allow once you kicked in the system over time because she couldn't make current justices leave it\nI think that would be a great idea it will never happen [noise]\nUm I mean I think the most creative idea that I came across was not so much a single term but by staffing the Supreme Court randomly I'm with a rotating series of nine judges picked among the chief judges\nOf the twelve lower federal appeals court in the country if it was just any bunch of judges picked and maybe it wouldn't be um nine of twelve maybe it will be five of twelve venue might\nActually give forced to the idea that the court is a neutral body it rules based on law not personality not based on the political views of this or that justice\nBut that these more anonymous lower court judges and the chief judge is of course are rotated based on seniority system might look\nMore like we have long imagined it to be the idea that the court is politicized is not\nA new issue it's just far more dramatic than it used to be and it cuts against what we all learned and civics class which is that the law is supposed to be neutral or government of laws not men and women and so forth I mean set all that any of these changes are incredibly unrealistic\nBut they have a Kevin thank you so much for talking with us it's a pleasure thanks for having me David Kaplan is the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution\nAfter we take a short break can technical review a new album I singer songwriter current via
