past you miss collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this bones\nI think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples otherwise it takes a kind of ... tone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it [noise]\nUm\nI'm Wondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his sons are read his palms\nFrom it at the same time and it transcend in quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is traveling you about the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time\nAnd that you don't feel like you said\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that uh that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that has a son but as a fan of your father's work\nI Would say that he performed his work in concert to large crowd of people\nAnd there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have and that that have his work has a life outside of his mouth had him and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room quietly reading his poems\nSo I go and how they want to get on record as say what I Know and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this was a man who's put the word hallelujah on many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men\nThat of course when it's attached to song it's supposed to live and uh and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading poetry that I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of refer to it I'm a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly coming to this book in absorbing and as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time not with my meter now with my voice\nSince you've declined to read more post like her father I'm going to find not being kicked kicked cantankerous or in transit you\nIt's just it's a it's I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little

recorded by the time you were born than someone Marianne that's no way to say goodbye burn out on a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so did you hear him he didn't he didn't meet me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like\nWhat's the sun and who's singing it um but but you are you at your father was a songwriter he must have had an awareness that sign writing was a craft that something people actually did\nAnd you must have been like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them anyway you\nKnow of course I heard them you know I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a foreign looking out into the looking at it faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just amenities the generosity of abilities and then as I grew older there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling language\nAnd um and you grow older than you then you sort of see\nHow remember um I remember I myself was making a record at the time and I described it and I asked my father for council is a dead you know maybe\nMaybe I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain and we were sitting on the corner of Wilshire and ... and I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record\nAnd was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic trail you don't never stop continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and he's\nIt's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um the la vida always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but I was also bought their intention out he was holding up this baton that\nHe had been given\nBy the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and do something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh\nThat baton off the ground [noise] hardly parents separated um five six but don't remember how much did you get to see us either after that [noise]\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of a union between two people have been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life\nDespite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me um I my mother moved my sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow our own whims\nAnd my father being would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nPete always you always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation ... like a mobile home [noise] oh yeah they are like what do you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing\nYeah I remember my mother moved to my sister and I all the way to south of France where we live to and there's a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things put at the at the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so are\nYou know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of in\nThat for well he did that and variations of that trip my own entire life and and you know as soon as they can\nContorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives with her feet\nAnd there's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own ways may be responsible\nFor the revival of his career and for for um his reconnection to people I'm Around the world and that that um he had an accountant or a business manager who they drain\nIf either savings and sold the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like stealing some older than other publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] yeah you know\nHe often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry um in incredible [laughter]\nWith the candidate of his work with his devotion to blanketing pages and melody that that he built the life he built himself and um [noise] when you experience this this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time ... made the heart grow fonder who knew\nHe'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and and others you know would quote him and\nUm but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal and lo and behold from this economic crisis a rose this most unexpected and [noise]\nFestive of periods in his life\nI Want to say festive I mean it was incredible to see\nThe um [noise]

like war the weaponization of social media\nYou look at the Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign and they were hip to the importance of this what did they do\nSo it was actually a twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject originally and got us researching it ever since [laughter] um\n[noise] the campaign in twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level amongst militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is that what is unusual is that the drone strikes video was up within a few hours\nAnd the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again in time or a mosque Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how fire\nAnd it's the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular target it would put out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that have been recovered then all of us would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just a social media operatives that these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the ... to one side or another\nTen million and all and it's first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region and this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and it's set a model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding whose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out\nBut importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and ... out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nEssentially they change by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals are making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message for residents\nSo originally the Israeli military is not\nNarratives but with very real physical and political effect and like any other military they learn they've reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military unit ah\nIn fact one of the fund a images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means and the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations\nWithin a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world can participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serve the cars and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in that kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from ah Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlist and an online army and get you know what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can enlist in Taylor Swiss army of swift ...\nYou can enlist in the Israeli defense forces on line army the uh cause may not be the same but the tactics are and by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you know giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one poll from the world at at crowd sources so to speak\nAnd one of the other tools of the trade what are the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and try and try and later on to it\nSo for example or you had the ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise\nFor a disease research this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nNew report rubble on your head\nYou would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of hijacking one discussion to drive it to your own in the same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a ...\nHijacked discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the interview fresh air is Dave Davies recorded with the W. singer and Emerson working authors of the new book like war the weaponization of social media\nDon't talk about

strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war\nThe weaponization of social media [noise] you know I'm interested in your sense of how um social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute\nA lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of [noise]\nAnd they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived in you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse [noise]\nIf you were watching your social media feeds during the comment on hearing in many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and\nUh it was in a certain way you hide both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military we're using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where uh they were enlisting\nThe online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together and they wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out\nWho sat next to Kavanaugh too I unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket that\nThen you got the other side the combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data to basically push this narrative or the Doppler gang or narratives that a doctor for a the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was\nNow that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe um the spread of disinformation the spread of alternative theories the idea of bearing the truth underneath a sea of lies it's something that for example Russia's specialized again\nAnd again you saw both sides engaging in this and the Kavanaugh to date pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona is in the like and the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side the narrative be buried underneath you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself or at least the online place that we\nHow after the Russian shoot down an airliner over Ukraine Russian um actors go under ... very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the ... hearing where I he used the term I'm In is a high school yearbook was sexual term\nAnd during his hearing he says no no no no it's not a sexual term it's about a drinking game the problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game until someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives\nGoes to create the evidence on ... to make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward it's going to see these kinds of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms are private companies are and they are now coming to terms with the fact that they play\nLike it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um and that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nNeural networks as part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just mimic but maybe in some ways surpassed I'm human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad\nOr so for example they can um create a wonderful imagery and seen images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nUm and it's very powerful and use of our for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company the this also as a way to save money or for example if\nTo be weaponized and so those very same I chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a and convince someone to take a certain position on a war a certain way\nTo challenge also moves into visual imagery there was an area known as deep fakes\nThese are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politician never made the teams that never happened\nAnd so with human finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies and turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks\nAnd so you get to strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome the origin of social networks are online where a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have this science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to a odd battling back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nRight so so so these neural networks ... could be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce the picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden honoring some you know profane a comment at something\nTo get real world examples of this there have already been creations of speeches that a rock Obama never gave\nOr there's other ones where you can layer real and fake imagery together\nWhere for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger to uh George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take that and build it together to allow you to a in essence create a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in this space it's going to be used for good for jokes for last it's going to be monetize for for profit\nAnd it's also going to be weaponized\nEmerson Brooklyn ...
