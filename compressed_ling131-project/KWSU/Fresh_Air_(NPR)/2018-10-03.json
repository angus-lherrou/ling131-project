author of the best sellers money ball and the big short which were adopted into films and the undoing project\nLewis lots of Trump's government by focusing on three departments energy commerce and agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or a corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service is part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nLewis says I fell by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing well others have conflicts of interest that political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nAnd started writing about this an article published in Vanity Fair Michael Lewis welcome back to ... explain my fifth risk as\nShort answer is it's the risk that you failed to imagine it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you and the longer answer is when I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump\nI come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as I'm wandering around the federal government trying to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what am I asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture department even the White House to name kind of the top risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with kind of three or four and then they can't think of the fifth so I thought that's the moment where the mind failed to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nWhy did you name it different rationale that you've explained with different threats means\nWhat was the response to what I found about how the Trump Administration has gone about taking over the federal government we're kind of light the fire and to me is when I discovered that the Obama administration has spent the\nBetter part of a year and thousands of people's lives preparing essentially the best course of that ever been created in in how to run the federal government of what was going on inside the federal government\nAnd that this course was meant to be delivered to whoever won the election the day after the election starting the day after the election and they were expecting hundreds of people to roll in to to receive these briefings and nobody showed up nobody to bring in many cases when I go get get get these briefings I'm the first person to have got them\nAnd I I thought well this enterprise is managing all these risks ... eight imagines but we as a society don't spend much time thinking about\nUm if it's being neglected ignored and and uh is operating on the basis of ignorance so I thought what happens when you do that across a big portfolio of risk like the federal government runs and ... would you what happens is you\nYou amplify the risk you you increase the probability of of these risk actually\nCausing problems [noise] see you write about three\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project Donald which I've been best sellers his new book the fifth risk as about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and Commerce Department [noise]\nYou know I'm Wondering there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um that Kavanaugh's confirmation story and not\nIf there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy that most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on but it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nAnd never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a AAA credit prize the biggest ... we ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of\nAbuse and scorn and it's collected rough and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and is is having added and nobody's paying much ... nobody's paying much attention because of slow moving stores and this to me you know one aspect of the fifth risk\nIs the got a lot of the risk that the government managers\nAre very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another ah cleaning up uh\nYou know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and ruin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been it's been frost is very short term attitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration has incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle\nAnd the public has gone along with it and that's ... that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department Leno like that kind of level of government where things are being done were positions aren't being replaced where people are being appointed who aren't really appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions as the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in a sense of risk atomic bomb includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department is really [noise]\nSo it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so the budget goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and the national weather service as a National Weather service at ... and the other one services the biggest part of north\nAnd how do they get their back in the seventies a Nixon was contemplating reorganization of government and um\nHe was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War in ... Nixon got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance so it's there it doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department a\nAnd it does it eat most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nYou're talking about Barry Myers who is the uh an accuweather [noise] that sounds actually like a good thing that he runs a weather Prediction Center okay\nWell I'm so here's the problem\nAh typically the person who runs NOAA has has a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um the problem is that the national weather service uh\nWhich has been a fabulous fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but\nBut but weather prediction has gotten generally dramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean ... and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better\nOr all of that saves lives and property or\nThat's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public uh it it has to let the rest of it has and has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a\nHas been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather can do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced\n... right to advance of a a a weather event that might kill you at the problem with is is that well in the first place if the the ... the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over is the uh adopt the radar network of radar stations across the country the national weather service spent the bulk of its money accumulating the data that then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and you know advertise the weather\nIs no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the day to the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts but what he's been trying to do is organized essentially a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYeah you're talking about the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons oh the high tech stuff that I'm\nIn no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a governor operation to deliver a weather forecast to the public\nSo Barry Myers or had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now [noise]\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and Mrs fresh air [noise]\nThe use of genomic testing to profile each individual's cancer and revealed possible treatment option\nLearn more about precision cancer treatment that Cancer Center dot com\nOffering a tire decision God to help consumers find tires that fit their car and driving conditions\nWith a network of more than seven thousand independent installers\nDirect dot com helping drivers find deliver install\nThe me too movement seems to only be getting stronger especially after Christine Blasey Ford's testimony last week United sexual assault survivors across social media\nThat's on one a at a [noise]\nIt's seven thirty I'm Hi Martin tell us and you are listening to northwest public broadcasting\nFor the blue St Louis card valley tonight watch for wind blowing up to forty miles per hour and that is possible blowing dust buster chance of isolated showers and thunder storms and some overnight lows may reach freezing with Patrick frost laws to lead my thirties forties much\nCooler Wednesday through the weekend was sunshine tomorrow is the mid fifties to mid sixties\nSupport for northwest public broadcasting comes from a fully instituted W.

I I Would love to have one outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say\nThe first place from is we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a long way of saying that I think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding we have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm it would that wouldn't shock me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why\nWould if you treat them at the national\nWell because the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots and lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable\nThey'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds with the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold ... if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow was going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and I'm just kind of playing with it here\nBut if you asked me to like ... predict what might trigger the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it some sort of political event\nAnd it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun when you predict things funding sort of predict things where where where they happened they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it ah\nI think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming\n[noise] my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy

didn't know what I was going to find when I start knocking on the door of the Energy Department or the agriculture department of Commerce Department\nAnd I try to having exactly the same experience the political people have when they're appointed to these jobs running these places and have these some preconceptions but vague preconception of what the bureaucrats are like [noise]\nUm this happens
