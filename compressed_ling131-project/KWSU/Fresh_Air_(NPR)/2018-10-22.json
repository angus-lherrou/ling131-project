air\nIt's two oh six ... super things for tuning into your NPR News service northwest public broadcasting on your Monday afternoon some fog and cloudy skies for western Washington high today in the mid fifties to lower sixties a beautiful day for the eastern cascades today\nThis is fresh air I'm Terry Gross my guess Melissa McCarthy is known for her comic roles and movies like bridesmaids and the heat and for her impersonation of President Trump's first press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live\nNow she takes a different direction in the new film can you ever forgive me which is based on the two thousand eight memoir of the same name by the Israel\nIsrael who died in twenty fourteen had a moderately successful career writing biographies of people who had fallen out of the popular consciousness like actress too little to bank cat and gossip columnist ... gallon\nBut after her biography of us Stay laughter flop she couldn't find a publisher for her next book about vaudeville star Fannie Bryce\nFinding herself broke unable to pay her rent or her cat that bill Israel deployed her writing skills to forge letters by literary luminaries like Dorothy Parker Edna forever no coward and the actress Louis Brooks and sold the letters to collectors\nReviewing the film and the New York times AOL Scott wrote me Israel may be the single most interesting movie character you will encounter this year let's start with a clip from the film in which Israel confide your secrets jak hop\nA fellow alcoholic who's grapes by an charm wet and numerous scams and hospitals jak is played by Richard II grant each of these characters has an acerbic sense of humor\nGoing through all my friends with the [noise]\nQuite by accident I find myself in a rather [noise]\nLaw school today supposed to be in trouble so I mean [noise] embellish [noise]\n\nBeautiful ching\nLiterary writer [noise]\nLittle tricks low mother says\nIf you're not understanding the world of elite\nCollectible literary artist was supposed\nTo be full gene pieces of paper to go with\nI Am selling to come home she getting [noise]\nThat there was a waste of a secret I should've gone out they're not in Iraq and hold the rock because I get a better response was to be told [noise]\nThe only one with her [laughter]\nReally different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic did her way\nBut I wouldn't call it movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy for an in it and you know physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent and a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you [noise] um\nI think it's a it's a new direction for how I think most people are used to seeing me I I was in New York for many many years doing um dramatic place so\nI'm quite comfortable and I always kind of think if you you know put all the all the things I've done together I I may have even done more drama than than comedy in its totality but uh [noise] I Do realize I most people haven't seen a lot of that it was incredibly far off Broadway plays\nEver forgive me which is based on a memoir by ally Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you've very famous for as a role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter] blend\nThe bride and the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing yet um you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of the of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can and it really wasn't a point of it oh okay\n... none of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and saw it we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny [noise]\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to term it for more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and I said what the the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny in kind of [noise]\nLike the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it because we had things like that do happen and I said if it's less about gross for growth and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like you have to look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile\nAnd to you and and how do you kind of like you just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter]\nWithin it'd be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do gross out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes so you're in one was really interesting 'cause you're saying that that's not really what was intended but it wasn't intended and\nIt was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible in wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all fallen said the wrong thing had some shaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if\nThat particular action hasn't happened to most people\n[noise] Melissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults [laughter]\nInsulting to do [laughter] I'm not real life uh maybe unreal I've I wouldn't know I don't know what are you not [laughter] but but the most famous example of that is and this is forty\nAnd there's there's a feud between if you're a teenage kids and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all called in to meet with the principal and that that the other couples are less manpower rod couple have threatened you so\nYou're all just kind of going at each other in the office so let's hear that same it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that might come with an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash than he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do he didn't say All right you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra our and our kids because with all the technological advances having to learn to use them responsibly no no when he when he said to me was he called me\nOn what language Catherine language I mean I can relate to what they do not all said to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her thing next door so neither man maybe if I look more like fake Kabul Bank commercial that's what you look like like your\nMy legs and kick you end up with my phone just really scaring me this is what happens in your corner you corner me I won't you drew you to you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it just got back on and on with more over the top insults is that's something that you're famous for outside like in the real world being able to [noise] to do really funny and solve\nYou know I Know I Do not oh go round insulting people um I Hope ever\nI don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on on screen but [noise]\nYeah one of the first time I watched\nThat back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] never say that and the first time a sitting with which to sit for watching you say it he said all of it and I\nI didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say every anything that came up to the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory has improved insults before\n[noise] yes I've had a\n... and only have played a lot of kind of very assertive um characters that you know I think in the heat\nEspecially part of part of the\nFront of the characters DNA was just it you literally say anything just to kind of kind of tear people down and I think kind of try to stand her\nIn her own authority so it was a big part of that character at your very impressive detective and that very aggressive detective um there is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but\nIt's part of the fun of getting to act you do these things that you would never\nDo your Boulder your harsher\nYou know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and uh\nThere is a there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nAnd I guess as Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new film can you ever forgive me we'll talk about growing up on a farm after a break and John Powers will review a new BBC series that\nCan you ever forgive me it's done by blossom viewing [noise]\n[noise]\n\nHe just loves me going [noise]\n[noise]\n\nThen you buy our family foundation support WHYY fresh air and its

it also because [noise]\nYou know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise] when you went into a regular comedy club or something that I really didn't like was there is this element there was always\nStill clubs club like are you actually the same guy and he was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like took your top off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does that ever worked for you is any woman ever been like\nOh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter] like it just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know four and a half minutes [noise]\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shutter now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it [noise]\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise]\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really makes a person so embarrassed that they stop talking what was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler [noise] God [noise]\nDon't think it was my favorite I think the more work somewhere I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of thing about are you here with your girlfriend an oh you're not\nHow was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road if like it's so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do votes and the talk about like wow you have no takers and\nIt would dissolve from there but afterwards and then on a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself I Know you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person to finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels bad like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like do I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the Oscars if you go over time they're going to play\nNow there's the light oh around ever present or not to ever not be heated\nLight that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white men clashing and like I Am yes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner\nOr manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a oh my God it's a really big deal yeah and the feeling other people's time ears stealing it yeah you're taking it out of there are going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something much might surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booze and I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager\nKind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on a laugh\nTo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he really encouraging me and then I [noise]\nI got off to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\nYou want to know women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles\n[noise] I think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where I don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I\nAnd challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read your kind of\nI don't even know what in that and the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship than their house and I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it out so I thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with cork an eccentricity use and isn't that why we always love or even just like people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I I felt that everything I read for female character was\nReally bland and and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like car all [laughter] I Would say I'm Still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like\nWhy did she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer I just I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this because I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors\nTheir careers or at least temporarily ended because they were ousted for assaulting Oregon rationing mental behavior yet to women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered in Hollywood now [noise] every little\nInch I Will take every centimeter forward I'll take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that is is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important about me too it's it's branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need money for it\nIn ... your strength and numbers it can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you in your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation some other time [laughter]\nI Would love to this has been a just
