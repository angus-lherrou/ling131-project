concert and to talk with him on her show and I'm grateful for the chance to talk with you today and thank you for being here\nWhen I interviewed your father in two thousand six after the publication

works I'm so is there is something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this problems\nI think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples otherwise it takes a kind of liberty is tone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it [noise]\nI'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father's sang sons or read his palm\nExistential distance from it at the same time and it transcend in quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is traveling you by the idea of you you reading of homes yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you said\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as the sun but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concert to large crowds of people\nAnd there's so many performers who have performed his songs so they have ... that have his work as a life outside of his mouth and ... and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room quietly reading his poems\nI've always wanted to I Want to get on the record essay what I Know and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in in a sense I mean this is a man who's put toward hallelujah on many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men\nThat of course when it's attached to song it's supposed to lift and ah and exist away songs suppose existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading poetry that I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of refer to it I'm a ... a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly coming to this book in observing in as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time not with my meter with my voice\nSince you've declined to read more fodder I'm going to say I'm not being ... in transit you know it's just it's it's I\nYour father reading and not another promising years from the interview that we recorded in two thousand six and this is a problem called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes and their ex sell this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nHad the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also the title singer was kindly accorded me even though I could barely cardio June\nFor many years I was known as a month I shaved my head in war robes and got up very early\nI hated every one but I acted generously and no one found me out my reputation as a ladies' man was a joke\nIt caused me to laugh bitterly through with a ten thousand nights I spent a

low 'cause she already has had twins realms of aimless privacy\nI think that home Adam gets so little about when you were talking about the connection of your father riding in solitude and reader re reading alone and has ... his [laughter] entering his solitude yeah as you\nNoted also kind of of humor you know that I remember I Love when of his lines where he says uh feel so good not to love you

like what's the sun and who's singing it um but but you are you at your father was a song writer scene must have had an awareness that sign writing was crafted something people actually did\nAnd you must have been like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard that manual you\nKnow of course I heard them you know I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a foreign looking out into the looking at it the faces of audiences you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older\nThere was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling the language and um\nAnd you grow older than you then you sort of see I remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know maybe maybe not really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nWhen we were sitting on the corner will ... and ... and I confess to him that I was going to ...\nMy boy you know altruistic values don't ever stop continue refining but instead he turned to me and said in his scrap your record that's an amateur move\nSaid amateur move he said yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um the la vida always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but it was also bought their intention out he was holding up the baton\nThat he had been given\nBy the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh that baton off the ground [noise] were you and your parents\nSeparated um five six and ... the darn remember so how much did you get to see us either after that [noise]\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people should have been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life\nDespite those complications and then some was remarkable is remarkable to me um I my mother moved my sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from them at all but just to follow her own whims\nAnd my father would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nHe'd always you always maintained a role in in our life despite my parents' separation\n... like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the liquid you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm yeah I remember my mother moved to my sister and I all the way to south of France where we live to\nAnd there's a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type thing and they put it at the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh [noise] you know every day after school\nWell he did that and variations of that trip my entire life and and as I say the the the intent to be part of his children's lives um the deliberate this week which he\nContorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was president in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own ways may be responsible\nFor the revival of his career and for his reconnection to people um I ... around the world and that that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and so on the publishing rights teen fathers fine that's kinda like stealing insulting sell other publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] yeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with a song and poetry and incredible [laughter]\nThat would the canon of his work with his devotion to blanketing pages and melody that that he built the life he built himself and um [noise] when you experience this this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time absence made the heart grow fonder who knew\nHe'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and and others you know would quote him and\nUm but it didn't result
