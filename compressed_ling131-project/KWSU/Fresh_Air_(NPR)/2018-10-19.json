Trump made Donald Trump a millionaire\nFour hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's business as much of his money was transferred from father to son with the help of schemes designed to avoid paying taxes some of which according to my gas or outright fraud\nSuzanne crab and David Barstow or to other reporters that the New York times who wrote a long investigative article about the many tax maneuvers Fred Trump device to passage vast fortune onto his children\nDoes and crack writes about the intersection of politics money in government for the times David Barstow has won three Pulitzer Prizes\nIn response to their reporting a lawyer for President Trump provided a written statement saying quote there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times bases it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate unquote\nBut neither the president or his lawyers disputed any of the specifics in the times financial reporting\nSo then crack David Barstow congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air it's such a pleasure to have you here give us a sense of French from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak\nFor Trump was a remarkable builder and in New York's the strategy was\nThe guy who build and sold his first home before you reach the age of twenty by the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes you're by the time he was in his mid forties he was really one of the biggest developers actually in the country and what he specialized in\nWas building middle class housing his homes which she built in his apartment buildings which he built in\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens or committee is no frills homes but he was able to build very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the\nThe Henry Ford hum of building in Brooklyn and queens of his\nUh in so he had an enormous skill building middle class housing and she also specialize in\nTapping into this wave of federal housing subsidies that began to build in the thirties and forties and especially with the return of the GIs from World war two and she would become one of the nation's biggest recipients of cheap federal loans to\nReaders now based on the actual facts um and based on actual documents an entirely new financial narrative of the forty fifth president\nWell let me reintroduce you can't if you're just joining us my gas I sit and crack and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on\nAsians schemes the family had and that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how Donald Trump engagement\nSuspect tax schemes as he reached origins from his father after we take a short break this is fresh air national news for the whole country today\nDreaming America's national security\nBy placing jar on foreign imports\nIt can also affect the places closest to you from big cities small town it's all about protecting jobs and saving jobs but when I make a statement when we're not doing it with them while you're the bigger picture every afternoon from NPR News\nAnd not from three to six thirty here on northwest public broadcasting\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter Suzanne crack and David Barstow two or three writers who reported\nJust a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes and he reads the riches from his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how it's a self made\nMillionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father funnel to him and another siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager [noise]\nOkay so in addition to some attack schemes we talked about\nI'm Fred Trump made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas into his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws [noise]\nAnd we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars of course it's two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct world that we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw but was it was important also it was in managers um these were loans that were never repaired human who would take her out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month he's going back to that in his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks\nTo to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or they increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then being off to the races [noise]\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he used the money for\nMany of his adventures the Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars\nIn debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going was father at these very crucial times for more support\nTo me get a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and end up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune ... on investment\nIt also see that when his cell you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety net was there to catch him\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this was a time\nAnd it you know the background of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump as a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino trips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money steering dollars' worth if it was a chat room and a half million dollars worth of casino chips\nAnd it just period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's well actually\nNineteen Ninety and Fred Trump immediately sees this quarter so as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk\nAnd Fred Trump immediately says no freaks out and he make the call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new quarter full within months of drafted that removes Donald was just told executor for Trump's Whelan puts Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new wealth has dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him but he makes this move it to be incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family what he did\n[laughter] so what you're saying I Can't get that at the end of ... life or toward the end of\nTrump's life Donald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bailing himself out and Fred tromp Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many years what\nWe know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this as an attempt to bring his from to gain\nComplete control over his state and potentially to use\nThe empire that Fred Trump doggedly impatient rebuild over many decades to use that empire has um potentially as collateral to help battle Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nI guess they're New York times reporters David Barstow and Suzanne crack after a break we'll talk about another scheme used to transfer of wealth from Fred Trump's real

Frank combat don't own at this time of his dad's out there don't include all the buildings that had been transferred from ... to the children\nThey included both the buildings that had been transferred down to one city owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire\nAnd it sold them you know the buildings that sold in two thousand and four or to a New York developer name or be shown in the price tag was just over seven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about died as we learned through the ... the documents that we went through that thought sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars to what the banks would value it out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that died empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that down and Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't so the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n\nUm you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with that so it's true that the Ira actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact they are as ours did push back some and when I was especially on the low valuations that have placed on buildings and made the trumps pay for a few million more bucks on this returning to them for a million more bucks on that return\nBut the way it it really works in this world is because you know you've got an agency that was pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a recession to extract a few million dollars that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nMost families who you know wealthy families who are the most expensive legal and accounting hoping Hoon gauge in these very sophisticated\nIt might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more\nMeanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of simply the the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts but especially hit the people who are looking at just gonna stay tax returns\n[noise] um because then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art video they are not the comeback or the print it and tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or the comeback go for it [noise]\nAh what else are he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven minutes of this story of his sort of you know pulling himself up and I'm Out of the mark of his casino collapse\nAnd through shows grit and determination and why are we negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book so happens to coincide with the time when\nThey actually took possession of one quarter of his father's real estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the story so it's just a moment when he's boasting about\nYou know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually coincides perfectly live at the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent of this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money might\nNot happen in two thousand and four I'm right as the sale had gone through the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Trump and yet when you watch that opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump the plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene for Trump belt and\nYou have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities [noise] and so many people still believe the mess and Donald Trump is still putting forward\nThe math it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked [noise]\nAnd I think that we've reset dot I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first step in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the\nThe power of the story is you know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up\nI think it's really hard to refute the story um it's hard for a few because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents with the Trump family themselves [noise]\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen so you spend\nA lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times but I was basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access to were locked up in this room um who cleaned it allowed\n[laughter] we uh we did not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody that's I did come in one day with a with a little documents and [laughter] [laughter] but we uh yeah it was uh\nJust the three of us for a year um with a yeah it's a pretty messy [laughter] I don't go right to ...\nAnd it'll cost our focus here I'd imagine [laughter] other people now are you were locked up in this room [noise] um actually\nPeople knew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to

worked for being as I said this sort of a charming lovely kind open gentle person was ... he became belligerent and angry and depressed and argumentative and he did things that were just inconceivable that he would do\nNick while I was ... preference like when you started using it what did he do for you need you want more\nWell I mean with all the drugs I sort of had this feeling but yeah with math particularly with like I've always been I'm\nTo embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be it's a higher power and things like that it was a neck would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately\nI learned and I think he learned that you could not deny\nSome of the basic principles including the first one which is you know Nick didn't agree for a long time it's just that that he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control he had to nearly died more than once before he finally I think accepted that and once you accept that I think you're in the door\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in ... step programs and in recovery I think it it it is a huge problem because I Try I spend a lot of timing trying so hard to practice prayer and doing all this stuff to make myself you know come to believe\nAnd ultimately you know when I sit with myself and the quiet moments you know when I'm Alone\nYou know I don't believe you know I think that for people who are just fundamentally you don't believe in God or any reason to this world or anything I think that they are at a disadvantage in terms of getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nBut the trip but but the other thing that I think is really important to that we learned is that there isn't just one way there wasn't just one way to get health again sober and to stop using the first thing that they're telling me about when he arrived at this last program\nWhich he sat with a um cancer and the counselor said to them you know why are you here and by then he was a you know he was a perfect student of of of rehab and so he said what you know he thought they expected him to say which is I'm here because I'm a drug addict and alcoholic\nAnd the guy said well wait let's let's go now why are you a drug addict and alcoholic you know why are you trying to kill yourself that's what that rehab was all about it was about trying to figure out what was going on inside\nAnd that's what I'm you know everybody you know it's different for everybody but for neck I think that that I mean that's what he says that that those three months were essential\nDo that program not ... not rely on the higher power\nAnd that was a part of it but um there was a lot of like experimental therapies and stuff that they did there and you know I sort of got to really go back and re experienced some of the traumas that experience growing up and I'm sort of relive them and and grieve them enough for the first time really ... allow myself to grieve them\nAnd to come to understand who I Am an end to learn you know tried as it sounds or whatever to to learn how to how to love myself and you know today like I I mean I don't want to kill myself you know I I don't at all I mean I I Love my life and stuff and yeah it doesn't have anything to do\nWith a higher power for me but as for a time people it does I'm certainly not you know dissing anybody mhm that feels that way absolutely\nDavid did you find you know something that you could describe as a higher power [noise]\nI I learned to define it in in a way that worked for me which is\nA it's something about our humanity I Would when I went to ... I was told by someone before this was over you will believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in prayer it is a way it was a way that I got through I never planned to pray I never said I'm going to pray\nI'm going to do what they told me but all of a sudden there were moments where I found myself praying and it was a way to get through ... what does it mean to you if you don't believe in God\n[noise]\nYou know it's it's a it's a really good question and I don't even know the answer I guess it was it was it was a it was a reflection of how desperate I was that unconsciously without saying I'm going to ... I was saying please please please save Mac please help heal my son I don't remember that's what I found it to myself over and over and over again [noise]\nUh and it was way be that way just to stay sane and to stay focused on something that you know I could hold onto or maybe I was young hedging my bats maybe I was praying in a way you know in case someone out there was listening\nNikki nicotine that there's um what part of what saved you from your math addiction with a degree of self knowledge\nThey were helped to acquire in your last rehab and that I think was do we have in which you were diagnosed with having bipolar disorder which is basically manic depression [noise] um did that help getting a diagnosis and then getting medication to deal with the diagnosis ...\nI I mean after you know it's a ... I think it's like very very subtle and you know I Am on two different medications and one of them is a bipolar medication and\nThey may but I I think that ... that date it's definitely you know one little piece of the puzzle in terms of learning how to be able to live with yourself you know a little bit more and yeah so I think if you need it you know if you get a really good doctor that knows what they're doing you know they can help you I think that's awesome after\nA Nick tells a story in his book that to me is so profound and it's done in just a beautiful way I think um [noise] he came to see us I'm Karen my my wife and Jasper and daisy\nOr we were in this we hadn't seen that for a long time and and care and said you know let's let's invite neck to join us we were doing on the family vacation and send it came over to the U.S\nAnd we were hanging out we had a really good time it was you know we talked a lot and it was very open and he talked to the kids about what had been going on and it was you know sort of the apologize to them in a way that's I think it was just so meaningful to them into caring and to me and\nWe had a really good time and then he describes the day before he was leaving he got\nJust really annoyed [laughter] and you talked about how he's ready to kill me and all of a sudden it hit him that\nTomorrow I'm leaving I'm that's what's going on here upsetting my I I don't really want to leave party wants to stay here\nAnd be a child again it'd be you know with my family and so I'm sort of\n... and ... and then all of a sudden he said he felt he said that I ... I feel better now and and he went back and the rest of the trip was it was great we had a really nice last day but then he said\nWhat just happened he says another time in my life that moment would have just been the beginning of a descent and it would have been the kind of dissent rather ended up in there going out to have a drink or to get some pot and then it's a mess and he said\nHow could it be the fact that I'm On this new medication and I just thought it was such a beautiful description of the way that it all work together well\nCongratulations to both of you on on on the books in on the friday Nick and you know good luck with some you know continuing it and everything I I you know I Wish you wish you well thank you both so much\nThank you thanks Terry\nMemoir about his struggled with addiction is titled tweak growing up on methamphetamines\nDavid chefs me more about his son's addiction is called beautiful boy which is also the name of the new movie starring Steve ... based on both their memoirs Jerry spoke with him in two thousand date\nDavid Sheff returned to fresh air five years later to talk about what he'd learned about the science of addiction and recovery will hear that interview after a short break and movie critic Justin change will review the new Melissa McCarthy film can you ever forgive me\n[noise]\nTo move our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station\nAnd from capital one committed to reimagining banking offerings savings and checking account that can be open from anywhere [noise] capital one what's in your wallet\nCapital one in a [noise]\nI'm from long me in makers of go to meeting a collaborative meeting platform\nWas over Eighteen million monthly users designed to connect people from anywhere in the world on any device learned more is go to meeting dot com\nGood afternoon you are listening to fresh air if you missed some of the program you can hear it again tonight at seven on your NPR News service northwest public broadcasting [noise] you can also find a complete list of our programs online at N.

video\nThis is pressure let's get back to tear each interview with David Sheff his book clean is about the medical science of addiction and recovery 'cause earlier book beautiful boy about his son mix addiction to mess has been made into a movie starring Steve corral\nIf your child's under Eighteen you can um force them to go into rehab right\nIn most places you can it's it's yes you can it's not easy but some states it's really complicated you have to get judges orders\nYou have to essentially commit them a police officer maybe half has to come and pronounce them a threat to themselves or someone else but still parents do have the legal right to get their kids into treatment did you ever do that\nI never had to resort to any kind of legal means of getting into treatment but still I had a lot of leverage\nYou know he was living at home he he would be desperate he would want to come home he would want help so he would call me up and he'll be willing to go to treatment so I had some leverage\nI never had to do a formal intervention but people do them they're dangerous or one of the pieces of advice I got over and over again from professionals is that they must be done by professionals by people are trained to do interventions they know what's going on in the ...\nBut whatever it takes whatever it takes to get someone to treatment about what we got to do what were the other way\nWell sometimes nickel just get tired of being out there and he would be so desperate he would you know he he just wanted to get off the streets you know it wasn't necessarily even life threatening um and so he was willing to go into treatment because that was my deal I'll come pick you up you know drive you to a treatment center check you in\nAnd so he would do it uh but as things went forward I mean the last time they relapse you know he's been sober for a long time it was after Nick and I talk to you on your show\nAnd you know one day we were together and he said I cannot believe what I did I was at someone's house just almost automatic I opened up the medicine cabinet there was a bottle of I couldn't I took one I thought to myself\nJust one\nWhich is common for addicts to you know that's the first thing that they'll say to themselves and to us\nAnd send the bottle was gone and he said\nI woke up this morning and realize that if I don't do something I'm going to be back on the streets within a week\nSo he you know this was the first time I didn't have to say a word he got on the phone he called the handled and treatment center in Minnesota He was on a plane that day\nTo me it's possible to look back on that and say how all the treatment before that were a failure here he was sober for such a long time and he relapsed again but to me it's the opposite it shows that the treatments had helped him so much\nThat he was able to recognize that he was in freefall that it was so dangerous for him he he had learned what they teach in a lot of treatment centers this behavioral cognitive thing where you can interrupt\nEither the craving that would lead to relapse or you can stop a relapse early and if you can you know you've made so much progress one of the things I talk about with addiction is progress not perfection so you know when they got in that play on that day\nI saw great great progress and since then he's been sober so\nIt shows that it's possible if people think that treatment can't work a mixed proof that it does\n[noise] so let's talk a little bit of that twelve step treatment programs you have a lot of experience with them because I think Nick had been in a twelve step program is probably gone to you know\nThe search for the book so you see you see you know positives and negatives with the ... step program too I think most people know like a positive or parts of the what are some of the problems you have to stop\nThe twelve steps are completely a profound you know treatment for so many people but not most people and that's the problem that I have it's not what the twelve steps\nIt's only many many rehabbed are based on this idea that the twelve steps are the kids are the only way to stay sober that's my problem [noise]\nSo my problem with the twelve steps is only when it's forced and it is forced in many places Nick was kicked out of this and treatment programs because he wouldn't embrace the twelve steps\nAnd and so we have to understand that you know there are many ways to get sober and the twelve steps is one and it works for some people but there needs to be alternative but I did go to Alan on meetings\nAnd what I found there was something different that helped me you know when it became addicted I didn't know other families who had kids who were addicts I\nI was ashamed and I felt that I was the only one and people telling me over and over and over again go to Ellen on meetings go to Alan on new things I Would roll my eyes and think I'm not going into one of those rooms where\nPeople are you know whining and sitting around in a circle and I walked into one of those rooms finally and I felt you know these are my people they know what I'm going through because they're going through it too so that comfort in that support was profound for me\nAlso going into these rooms you know I I was suffering so much inside and so I Would go through my day and I would have to put on the face that everything was okay and I had to work I go to be my younger children daisy and Jasper school and and you know I had to keep it together\nI walked into these rooms and I didn't have to keep it together I was allowed to just sit in the back and feel you know whatever it was this just terror and other people were feeling as when I was able to cry and I was able to\nYou know there was no pretense and those rooms there was this openness it didn't make things go away but it made it easier to get through some of the days\n[noise] listen on a positive note [laughter] and and if it's OK the aid if it's not prying into your son next privacy he sounds like he's doing really well now professionally as well as press makes commercial update on his life is that's not prying too much\nAn unbelievable person I've been ... and so I'm I'm prejudiced but he\nHit extraordinary has just this lovely person that he helps a lot of people getting stay sober I hear from people all the time you know kids who say I read next book I heard him talk and that's why I've gone into recovery\nIs really healthy he exercises every day he got married to this woman that we adore you know they were best friends when they were sixth and seventh grade ... writing like mad he just had the novel or accepted\nSo you know we're just so lucky whereas if I'm lucky I'm I mean all these other things are are great but the main thing is that she's alive there were so many times when I didn't think he was going to make it\nThey have a chest thank you so much for talking with us and I'm pleased to my best regards to your son Nick I spoke with him once [laughter] on the show and I'm I'm so glad he's um he's doing well so thank you thank you very much ... thank you so much\nDavid Sheff speaking with
