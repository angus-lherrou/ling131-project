Know what was that gender or race atmosphere in comedy clubs like for you and then\nI think it's the same as it is now it's a lotta straight white guys some women and some people of color a few queer people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um [noise]\nThat can be exhausting I think is probably the most polite way to put it there is just the way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out that you do I think you can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up till incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that male comics talk all the time about their body functions and their man parts but of women do it it's considered gross so\nThings like ... and there are a lot of you know men in the audience\n[noise] yeah I mean I think just I just want to be clear that went anyone started doing stand up like your full trash you know what I mean like you you're just like not that great you're really started posting on personality\nI'm and you're hoping your jokes are kind of funny and you know I've been doing comedy for ten years and I think I finally got to a place where I can a curse is I I don't\nHave to believe it too so why bother I don't want to do that yet\nI don't want to I don't want to do it I'm not alone Wayne okay I'm not going to [laughter]\n\nUm so I just really got to a place you know I think honestly the place I got to happened when I went on tour last fall with a lot of ... we did our why why tore across America\nAnd we were both kind of being like\nOh we're funny we've been doubting ourselves this whole freaking time at a law that has been informed by the fact that we have different energy that a lot of the male comics we carry yourself different maybe tell a joke in a different way or different style\nAnd we were beating ourselves up in allowing that sort of\nImagine what it's like to not have laughed and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a ... queens that would have been\nA game changer for me to just like here to black women like young black woman oh well I'm thirty four but I'm like hey young black women [laughter] but you know to hear to like young black women talking about\nOh this one time I got my hair done at the salon and they did that to my hair and like totally like messed it up I couldn't talk about by black hair woes\nAnd high school with like Laura she doesn't know too that you just wake up and she has to go flawless like straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so\nI think in the end it

be a child in the nineties with like ... or\nYou know Martin Family Matters and girlfriends and all these sort of shows where you can still see you know like Tracy Ellis Rother I could still see like queen ... Kim Fields and be like oh okay cool so I could kind of see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman [noise] you're right about\nBody image in your book and you say yeah as you were fourteen your brand has been consumed with all the way as your body is like not good enough meaning not attractive to straight do than for failing to meet fashion industry standards and you say even age thirty\nDecided on it so how do you try to overcome that because it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been a expected to conform to certain bodies standards mhm is at a different place\nThan you are just kind of visceral like I gain too much weight kind of feelings [noise]\nI think that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or you know I'm a writer with no other an analogies great moving on [laughter] but you know what I mean there's always that that thing that it's like that you ... you mentally you know better but\nConditioning still make that self dot com and so I think what I\nHave done is I have chosen to refocus that energy like I'm getting back into exercising but not like I don't have a scale in a house I make it is not about a number\nIf you're just going like I Need to make strong strong enough to get through the day rather than I I Want to make sure I look and nice pair of jeans\nI feel more powerful the little bit of experiences that have gotten with like styling and doing like these photo shoot\nAnd again these are champagne problems I just went up ...

exploration\nIn Washington Black ... has created a wonder of an adventure story powered by the helium of fantasy but also by the tender sensibility of its aspiring young hero wash black\n[noise] let's backtrack a second to that opening scene at the plantation\nThe new master is not the only white men who steps down from that carriage\nHis younger brother Christopher wild nicknamed pitch also a lights he turns out to be a rather decent man of science who's brought along the materials to assemble what he calls a cloud cutter\nA hot air balloon attached to a book\nAnd in the process discovering that washed possesses a skill for executing detailed scientific drawings\nAcross the color line the to strike up a kind of friendship\nSo much so that when it seems likely that wash will be killed in wrongful retaliation for the death of a white visitor to the plantation\nPitch fires up the gas canister cuts the ropes that tether the cloud cover ... earth and together the to ascend

just a boy in bobble\nWashes weighted down throughout his travels by the burden some question of identity for one thing he can never predict how other characters whether they be black or white will see him\nThe prize scientific education he received from pitch elevates wash but also makes him a curiosity\nMuch like the solitary little orange octopus he captures on his underwater dive to later exhibits washed resolutely places his faith in science to advance human enlightenment but midway through the novel he experiences a harsh awakening\nI had long seen science as the great equalizer wash says no matter one's race or sex or faith there were facts in the world\nCorrupted by human beings\nWashington Black is an unconventional and often touching novel about the search for transcendence

fresh air producer Sam\nRather ... welcome to fresh air [noise] Hi I'm really pleased to be here\nUm the plantation of your novels in Barbados I gather you do a lot of research for your work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\n[noise] you know I'm not I'm not a full blown historian much you know given my readings from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the census preservation of of um of one's workers ah you know everywhere expendable so the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher\nThe are the conditions and circumstances of Slate's lives for much more dire and um you know quite horrific to have to to do that research but I'm very important for me to show what that was like [noise]\nThe main character booked a is George Washington black who goes by the nickname wash and he's a field work around those plantation but one day he gets a call to go to serve the that the main house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nBut the masters brother is there his name is Christopher wild who goes by ... there's a lot of nicknames and uh she's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he requested wash his assistant mainly just because he's like the right weight he's as for ballot for the balloon [noise]\nUm and it's a moment the changes wash his life forever because\nWash a scape but it's such an arbitrary moment an such an arbitrary changed and the and the sports life and not arbitrary not forever hearts wash\nChristopher does choose Washington because he sees them as\nBeing helpful to his experiment and that he is you know precisely the right weight a demand his arrows stats are which is you know kind of cruelty in itself to to look at somebody and I think it out of them but then Washington really surprises him\nWith his natural gets sick he has no\nNo idea that this is the young men just completely you just don't naturally a gifted at a drawing and um he has a good sense for 'em or an article methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under attach [noise]\nBut um you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest her explore into ... character in you know although he's an extremely liberal minded man for his time\nAh you know there are limits to hints to his thinking that teens and a lot of ways to tethered by a certain ideas and and notions\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist though he truly has a very general belief in the rights of men it's kind of a prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nRight his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get them to heaven if they allow such cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this is central to his\nA philosophy or adult life but you know having said that he's somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to kill a great affection for Washington and so there's that dichotomy and his personality that's so interesting to me\nSo they'll wash a scrapes from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from the time he lived them um you know it was haunted by his time on the plantation and I think one of the points\nYou're getting up in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how fear the people complicit in slavery the slave economy\n'cause he has become my ideas that he is and because he's actually trying to do something to end slavery itself you know I think he has a sense of himself as being quite a moral person and\nThen he goes into the world's with that feeling about himself and feeling quite good about his place\nIn in the world but he's not really thinking about the fact that you know for all of his scientific pursuits this is\nBeing funded by slavery a and he's kind of turned a blind eye to that and so he's profoundly affected by it because he wouldn't be able to do what he does a without that a dark commerce going on",
