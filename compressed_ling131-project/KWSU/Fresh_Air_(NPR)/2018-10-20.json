and why am\nToday we'll hear parts of Terry's interviews with the chefs first her conversation with David and Nick chef recorded in two thousand date she started with the question for David\nCan you talk a little bit about how he stands personality changed when he was using mass\nPiggy became unrecognizable or he went from being\nJust one of the most sort of light filled extraordinary people that I knew and he became\nThis coast a sort of coming in and out of the house\nI mean physically he changed you know he lost his skin and bombs and he was\nJittery and and then his behavior changed I mean if you buy for being as I said this sort of a charming lovely kind open gentle person was ... he became belligerent and angry and depressed and argumentative and he did things that were just inconceivable that he would do\nIt made you want more\nWell I mean with all the drugs I sort of had this feeling but yeah with math particularly with like I've always been I'm\nTo I too felt guilty when you're asked me about what I felt guilty for I felt guilty for that too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is to embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him\nResist but I think ultimately\nI learned and I think he learned that you could not deny some of the basic principles including the first one which is you know\nAnd they didn't agree for a long time it's just ... but he but he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control he had to nearly died more than once before he finally and I think except about and once you accept that I think you're in the door\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in twelve step program and in recovery I think it it it is a huge problem because I Try I spent a lot of time you know trying so hard to practice prayer and doing all this stuff to make myself you know come to believe\nAnd ultimately you know when I sit with myself in the quiet moments you know when I'm Alone\nYou know I don't believe you know I think that for people who are just fundamentally you know don't believe in God or any reason to this world or anything I think that they are at at a disadvantage in terms of getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nThat's a trip but but the other thing that I think is really important to ... we learned is that there isn't just one way there wasn't just one way to get health again sober and to stop using the first thing that they're told me about when he arrived at this last program\nWhich he sat with a um counselor and the counselor said to him you know why are you here and by then he was a you know he was a perfect student of of of rehab and so he said what you know he thought the expected him to say which is I'm here because I'm a drug addict and alcoholic\nAnd the guy said wait let's let's go now why are you a drug addict and alcoholic you know why are you trying to kill yourself that's what that rehab was all about it was about trying to figure out what was going on inside\nAnd that's what I'm you know everybody you know it's different for everybody but for neck I think that that I mean that's what he says that but those three months were essential\nTo do that program not ... not rely on the higher power principle\nIt didn't rely on it completely no I mean they there was definitely that was there and and that was the part of it but um there was a lot of like experimental therapies and stuff that they did there and you know I sort of\nGot to really go back and re experience some of the traumas that I experience growing up and I'm sort of relive them and and greed them you know for the first time really allow myself to grieve them\nAnd to come to understand who I Am an end to learn you know I've tried as it sounds or whatever to to learn how to how to love myself and you know today like I I mean I don't want to kill myself\nWith a higher power for me but uh for a time people it does I'm certainly not you know dissing anybody that feels that way absolutely\nDavid did you find you know something that you could describe as a higher power [noise]\nI I learned to define it in in a way that worked for me which is um something about our humanity I Would when I went to ... I was told by someone before this is over you believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in prayer [noise]\nIt is the way it was a way that I got through I never planned to pray I never said I'm going to pray I'm going to do what they're told me but all of a sudden there were moments where I found myself praying and it was a way to get through\n... what is pretty mean to you if you don't believe in God\n[noise]\nYou know it's it's a it's a really good question and I don't even know the answer I guess it was it was a it was a it was a reflection of how desperate I was that unconsciously without saying I'm going to ... I was saying please please please save Mac please help heal my son I remember that's what I chatted to myself over and over and over again [noise]\nUh and it was way be that way just to stay sane and its effect focused on something that you know I could hold onto or maybe I was you know hedging my bat maybe I was praying in a way you know in case someone out there was listening\nNicotine nicotine that there's um the part of what saved you from your math addiction when it's a degree of self knowledge they were helped to acquire in your last rehab and that I think was do we have in which you were diagnosed with having bipolar disorder which is basically manic depression um\nDid that help getting a diagnosis and then getting the medication to deal with a diagnosis\nYes I I mean after you had to ... I think it's like very very subtle and you know I Am on two different medications and one of them is a bipolar medication and it's you know it's there so I mean I couldn't even tell you necessarily\nYou know what the differences are or how it's helping me but I I think that that they it's definitely you know one little piece of the puzzle in terms of learning how to be able to live with yourself you know a little bit more and yet so I think that if you need it you know if you get a really good doctor that knows what they're doing you know they can help you I think that's awesome after a really\nA Nick tells a story in his book but to me is so profound and it's done in just a beautiful way I think um [noise] he came to see us I'm Karen my my wife and Jasper and daisy\nFamily vacation and and it came over to the U.S\nAnd we were hanging out we had a really good time it was you know we talked a lot and it was very open and he talked to the kids about what they've been going on and it was sort of to apologize to them in a way that was I think it was just so meaningful to them into caring and to me and\nWe had a really good time and then she describes the day before he was leaving he got\nJust really annoyed when you talked about you know he's ready to kill me and all of a sudden it hit him that\nTomorrow I believing oh I'm that's what's going on here I was studying my I I don't really want to leave party wants to stay here\nAnd be a child is going to be you know with my family and so I'm sort of\n... and ... and then all of a sudden he said he felt he said that I ... I feel better now and and he went back and the rest of the trip was it was great we had a really nice last day but then he said\nWhat just happened he says another time in my life that moment would have just been the beginning of a descent and it would have been the kind of distracted by the end it up and they're going to have a drink or to get some pot and then it's a mess and he said\nHow could it be the fact that I'm On this new medication and I just thought it was such a beautiful description of the way that it all works together\nWell listen congratulations to both of you on on on the books in on the ... you know ... good luck with some you know continuing it and everything I I you know I Wish you wish you well thank you both so much\nThank you Terry Terry\n... ships memoir about his struggled with addiction is titled tweak growing up on methamphetamines\nDavid chefs me more about his son's addiction is called beautiful boy which is also the name of the new movie starring Steve ... based on both their memoirs here we spoke with him in two thousand date\nDavid Sheff returned to fresh air five years later to talk about what he'd learned about the science of addiction and recovery will hear that interview after a short break\nAnd movie critic Justin change will review the new Melissa McCarthy film can you ever forgive me [noise]\nBe Davies emphasis pressure [noise]\nTo move our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station\nAnd from capital one committed to reimagining banking offerings savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere capital one what's in your wallet\nCapital one in a [noise]\nAnd from logged me in makers of go to meeting a collaborative meeting platform was over Eighteen\nMillion monthly use are designed to connect people from anywhere in the world on any device learn more is go to meeting dot com\n\nHear more from journalists David fast in a minute including the science of addiction and recovery from buck [noise] clean overcoming addiction and ending America's greatest tragedy [noise] at seven thirty I'm Claire Martin tell us and you are listening to northwest public broadcasting [noise]\nThe produce and Louis ... remain dry through the weekend the pattern of sunny mind days and Ken I should continue ...

and Kathryn ... a new episode every Friday on prime video\nThis is fresh air let's get back to ... interview with David Sheff his book clean is about the medical science of addiction and recovery 'cause earlier book beautiful boy about his son Knicks addiction to mess has been made into a movie starring Steve corral\nIf your child under Eighteen you can um force them to go into rehab right\nMost places you can it's it's yes you can it's not easy in some states it's really complicated you have to get judges orders you have to essentially commit them a police officer maybe half has to come and pronounce them a threat to themselves or someone else but still parents do have the legal right to get their kids into treatment did you ever do that\nI never had to resort to any kind of legal means of getting into treatment but still I had a lot of leverage\nYou know he was living at home he he would be desperate he would want to come home he would want help so he would call me up and he would be willing to go to treatment so I had some leverage\nI never had to do a formal intervention but people do them\nThey're dangerous or one of the pieces of advice I got over and over again from professionals is that they must be done by professionals by people are trained to do interventions they know what's going on and they understand the risks\nBut um I never had to do that I was able to get into treatment other ways but whatever it takes whatever it takes to get someone to treatment that's what we got to do what were the other way well sometimes a nickel just get tired of being out there and he would be so desperate he would you know he he just wanted to\nGet off the streets you know it wasn't necessarily even life threatening um and so he was willing to go into treatment because that was my deal I'll come pick you up you know drive you a treatment center check you and\nAnd so he would do it uh but as things went forward I mean the last time they relapse\nAnd one day we were together and he said I cannot believe what I did I was at someone's house just almost automatic I opened up the medicine cabinet there was a bottle of I could then I took one I thought to myself just one\nWhich is common for addicts to you know that's the first thing that they'll say to themselves and to us\nAnd some of the bottle was gone and he said\nI woke up this morning and realize that if I don't do something I Am going to be back on the streets within a week\nSo he you know this was the first time I didn't have to say a word he got on the phone he called the handled and treatment center in Minnesota He was on a plane that day\nTo me it's possible to look back on that and say how all the treatment before that were a failure here he was sober for such a long time and he relapsed again but to me it's the opposite it shows that the treatments have helped him so much\nThat he was able to recognize that he was in freefall that it was so dangerous for him he he had learned what they teach in a lot of treatment centers this behavioral cognitive thing where you can interrupt\nEither the craving that would lead to relapse or you can stop a relapse early and if you can you know you've made so much progress ... one of the things they talk about with addiction is progress not perfection so so when they got in that play on that day\nI saw great great progress and since then he's been sober so\nIt shows that it's possible I mean people think that treatment can't work a mixed proof that it does [noise]\nSo let's talk a little bit of that twelve steps treatment programs you have a lot of experience with them because I think Nick had been ... step program is probably gone to you know I I trust that program for parents\nEllen on yeah yeah and then you visited them just as research for the book so you see you see you know positives and negatives with the ... step program\nToo I think most people know like the positive\nAh parts but what are some of the problems you have to stop\nThe twelve steps are completely the profound you know treatment for so many people but not most people and that's the problem that I have it's not what the twelve steps it's only many many rehabbed are based on this idea that the twelve steps are\nSo it's only when it's forced and it is forest in many places Nick was kicked out of this and treatment programs because he wouldn't embrace the twelve steps\nAnd and so we have to understand that you know there are many ways to get sober and the twelve steps is one and it works for some people but there needs to be alternatives but I did go to Alan on meetings\nAnd what I found there was something different that helped me you know when it became addicted I didn't know other families who had kids who were addicts I\nI was ashamed and I felt that I was the only one and people told me over and over and over again go to Ellen on meetings go to Alan on new things I Would sort of roll my eyes and saying I'm not going into one of those rooms where\nPeople are you know whining and sitting around in a circle and I walked into one of those rooms finally and I felt you know these are my people they know what I'm going through because they're going through it too so that comfort in that support was profound for me\nAlso going into these rooms you know I I was suffering so much inside and so I Would go through my day and I would have to put on the face that everything was okay and I had to work I go to be my younger children daisy and Jasper school and and you know I had to keep it together\nI walked into these rooms and I didn't have to keep it together I was allowed to just sit in the back and feel you know whatever it was this just terror and other people were feeling as when I was able to cry and I was able to\nYou know there was no pretense and those rooms there was this openness it didn't make things go away but it made it easier to get through some of the days\n[noise] we spend on a positive note [laughter] and and if he can't have the aid if not prying into your son next privacy he sounds like he's doing really well now professionally as well as person that just gives all update on his life is that's not ... too much\nIt's not I mean this is really you know I think he's great country what can I say he's an unbelievable person I'm a ... and so I'm I'm I'm prejudiced but he\nHit extraordinary he's just a lovely person he helps a lot of people getting stay sober I hear from people all the time you know with kids who say I read next book I heard him talk and that's why I've gotten into recovery\nIs really healthy he exercises every day he got married to this woman that we adore you know they were best friends when they were sixth and seventh grade ... writing like mad he just had a novel or accepted so you know we're just\nIs that he's alive there were so many times when I didn't think he was going to make it\nThey have a chest thank you so much for talking with us
