Robert Bauer shot and killed at least eleven congregants at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh Saturday we decided to postpone are scheduled interview with Jonah Hill we'll hear that tomorrow today we're going to talk about how Bowers views echo the rhetoric of the white nationalist movement\nAnd about the threat that this movement poses my guess ... a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred\nAnd focuses on the story of Derek Black\nDerek father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an Arab parents in the movement but here we now says racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties and a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with fast slow this morning\nHe likes ... welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the synagogue I thought about your book\nDerek Black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black is still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull a trigger the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that\nBut do you find Don black story relevant to the views that were expressed by the shooter Robert powers\nThink you can draw a straight line from dawn views and gone working this movement to the views expressed by the shooter a straight line honestly starts with just the NCAA the shooter spot a tattoo fourteen idiots to white national slogans fourteen refers to are fourteen word\nFor statement on purpose but as central to western frog does about securing a future for the white race and the existence of whites\nStand by and watch my people get get murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on storm front and that's the way that they speak about this a quote unquote race war that they believe is underway\nYeah the um uh uh ... had had said that um he believed the Jews were committing genocide against his people genocide of what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believe the Jews are committing genocide\nThey do and both Don and Derek worst central to the the sort of creation of that language even the term genocide that was one of the main things that Derrick and Don\nTried to spread and popularized on the radio show and and the idea behind it was that instead of speaking about ah you know\nMinorities and slurs or things like that that they could appeal to white people by the idea that their race was slowly disappearing and more than that that this was a genocide that somebody else was doing to white people uh you know it's it's\nA ludicrous idea but unfortunately it's had huge purchasing this movement and now white genocide I Would say is probably at the top of the paradigm of white nationalist ideas\nTo have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue\nUm instilling friend in the state that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son so so what are you reading on doing right now\nThere is some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm fronts and\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh\nYou know several mass shootings connected back to people who've spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that's what all this probably isn't quite the way to go about it he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but\nThe people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself but our our global is and choose who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to\nBring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect but every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\nSo you have you spoken with either gone or Darren black since the shooting at the center guard yesterday\nI've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways culpable and he wanders had you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism plays into\nYou know incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and to to popularize the movement so to have somebody going to a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building saying the phrase that you yourself\nIt's hotter Eliza ... lowest the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek Black a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Derrick black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air\nMe too has changed our culture but it's changing our laws ... states are

service\nThis is fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday\nEcho the views of the white nationalist movement we're going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Derrick black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before renowned sing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nDerek father Don black\nIs a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nDerek Black is the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli Sasha low who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included fast so the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than\nWhite national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we're better than but we're all better off being separated by by race is like\nYeah but in popular everywhere and white nationalism in so that was his thing\nHe didn't invent it but he was as far as it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest ones to adopted and when he founded storm front called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be to be forcibly put in different spaces and that that was uh\nHe thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational I how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nCandidate for a second I've always wanted to know\nThe early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism what are they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream movement and make it more palatable or whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not doing bad things to other people that\nThe uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not and gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confidante way\nI'm sure everybody is basically all white people are basically racist they're just afraid to express it to let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo they they don't like the word race is I think that's a made up insults were they when Clinton was the word um racial less out of you to hang\nOver the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively pursuing an end cause of separating and\nYou know races into into different homeland Sam White supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguished movement in the same way\nAnd I'm white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language but I think is still effective and useful for us as we talked about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter Eliza ... who wrote a book about blacks called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a

good a lives and their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against that every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology the point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with the white nationalist I Would press them on what you mean that you want to separate\nNative is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they do they have they have no idea at so which I think it's the core issue that and in races and nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nThere was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public ah and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this Fisher how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those with regard to define who's white because only a white person can be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to say the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to as to who is white was that you had a\nGenerally be considered visually white by most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recruited in September with Derrick black a former white nationalist leader and Washington Post ... ...

who renounced interviews when he was twenty to his father Don black as a former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter ... the author of a book about Derek Black\nCalled rising out of hatred\nSo there are one of the things you did you have been home schooled so you were pretty\nIsolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views [noise]\nUm but then you went to college and from the way you described it in the book was a pretty liberal college in Florida and we're Jewish people there you actually tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were out in by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you must have publication with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God I stared black so after you kind of out of yourself\nAnd after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when I found out who you really are\nUm you had Jewish friends who reached out to you even had a girlfriend who ... who didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends\nSaid to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nBut I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew ... dinners took the strategy that I think it was very very smart\nOf ... are not talking to me about it ah I went to those dinners for two years and they went nationalism never came up ... every other thing that we were possibly interested in did [noise]\nUm and I think the map you said that the reason for that or was that it would have\nBeen a not as effective at allowing me\nTo see him and dinners as people\nThat when my family is talking about\nAnd he wanted to demonstrate that it even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd effective I actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general at being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermine the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups there already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where either this is this is crazy when you to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of dark transformation I mean I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that and a lot of different ways I mean there was a civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast staring out and made it clear to him\nHow how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah who won won his trust built in a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through in and uh\nAnd showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited to Derrick over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build their relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with that and she would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in and of itself could be transformative and I think\nIt's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the least of this ideology and the things that Derrick had said Matthew in ... in between these dinners\nWhich sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site and they would see the horrible things that you said about Jews and and ... yeah\nJews worm their way into control over\nLike the awful pyramid and beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one because I think white nationalist believe the Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and I\nAre sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist with defined as the white race and\nSo ... had also in their own lives experienced large degrees of anti Semitism in ... case he's a from a family of Hungarian Jews there was all but wiped out by the Holocaust that in Bergen Dawson and that was the definitive experience and his\nYoung life was growing up in an orthodox community that was largely defined by a by by an an incredible history of anti Semitism and and the Holocaust and\n... had had gone and traveled to these concentration camps and had had learned German to connect with his father's history and Derek and also learned German because of his very divergent family history and the fact that the two of them a week after week we're sitting at the same table sometimes having conversations and the Germans they learn because of\nBecause of these incredibly diversion family histories and began to have in effect\nThere's a lot of Holocaust denying within the white nationalist movement [noise] can you explain to me how it's possible to believe in the first place that the
