able to log onto the accounts at least Fifteen million Facebook users but that's just one element\nAnd back disinformation campaign and the twenty sixteen election that reach tens of millions of its

of an off now is explore space but history and profiles it's thirty four year old founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in a recent issue of the magazine\nHe says ... let's drive to expand Facebook's reach has jeopardized the privacy of its users and made it vulnerable to political manipulation\nHis story is titled ghost in the machine can Mark Zuckerberg fix Facebook before it breaks democracy he spoke with fresh air is Dave Davies\nWill Evan us welcome back to the fresh air you know we all know Facebook is a very big deal give us a sense of its size and reach\nThere's really nothing quite like it in the history of American business uh it is now to point two billion monthly active users meaning it's larger than any country in the world it's really got no\nI'm no natural precedent when you look at the history of enterprise it's really closer in terms of scale and reach to\nA political ideology or religious faith I mean it just didn't literal terms it now has as many adherents a as Christianity and that is all been built in the last fourteen years and so it was founded in two thousand for\n[noise] for this piece you visited Mark Zuckerberg at his home at his office had numerous meetings a lot of access from a guy who was pretty careful about you know journalists to getting connected to him how did you convince him to share so much time with him [noise]\nWell he did it I should say reluctantly um this was a long process that started a year ago when I first approached them about the idea of this kind of story I said look I I\nWe do in the New Yorker these very long detailed profiles and I think initially Facebook's view was we don't need to do this or a big powerful company\nUm and I continue to work on it basically started interviewing a lot of other people around Facebook people who worked there in the past people who work there and the presents\n\n\n\nIn which he said that as he put it he's become a conscientious objector to social media you said God Knows what it's doing to our children's\nBrains and and then a few days later there was another very prominent former Facebook executive named ... who had been the head of growth and vice president of user growth which was an absolutely central position at the company for a number of years and he came out and said [noise]\nYou know in the back of our minds we all had a sense that something might be going wrong but our product the thing that we were building I'm paraphrasing here was as he put it contributing to the breakdown of social discourse the breakdown of society and he said he would never let his children use this kind of\nProduct I think because the public face of the company has been so on message about how they contribute in their minds to doing good in the world to have some very senior former executives come out and talk about what the public has come to believe which is that there are these very serious side effects\nTo the company's growth was a real wakeup call externally and I think somewhat internally\nYes side effects in terms of increasing you know social tensions and in some cases violent political activity what about isolation addictive behaviors\nThere has been a growing body of research that shows a and it's been published in sort of the major scientific an academic journals that there is a correlation in some cases between heavy Facebook use and decreased sense of wellbeing a sense of connection people feel lonely\nThere is a lot that they're trying to figure out about this but it's gotten to the point where the data is Annette ... and the company has a gun to acknowledge it you heard for the first time early this year\nThat Facebook said look we recognize that there are different ways that you can use this and if you're just using it passively\nIf you're just sitting there scrolling would glazed eyes hour after hour we recognize this is not good for you and so what they did is they said we're going to try to change it a bit so that people are more actively\nEngaged so that they're you know talking to friends actively communicating with their family members and stuff like that but that was a key\nDifference from how they used to talk about it which was that if you didn't agree with the fundamental premise that Facebook was basically good than it was a kind of heresy and they wouldn't want to have the conversation they are now slowly acclimated to the idea that people just don't buy that anymore\nYou know you talk to ... a fair amount about this you know pushing the boundaries of privacy to grow that if you regard this kind of experimentation\nAbsorbed\nHe's made choices that he hasn't and some of the mistakes that he has which is that he\nDecided early on that he was very often going to be criticized he said look this is just a fact of what we do as he said look we're not selling dog food here we're doing something in ... intensely inherently controversial it's at the intersection of psychology and technology and\nSo when people criticize Facebook for being [noise]\nUm too casual about their privacy for allowing data or to be a ... to to get out into the world I'm very often what she came to believe was that they would criticize them at the time but over time eventually they would accept that they would get used to it and they would keep signing on they would keep growing\nAnd that idea about criticism I'm really hardened and became a central governing principle at Facebook this sense that they were leaders they were pioneers they were forging ahead they had to push the public beyond his comfort zone when it came to being\nLess private because if they didn't do it then people wouldn't wouldn't go there but they were convinced that even in the cases of controversy when you had a civil libertarians or regulators or politicians ordinary member of the public complaining about Facebook that that was simply a sign that they were being\nBold and that idea continued really until until the present day\nIs it true that in two thousand ten he said privacy is no longer a social norm\n[noise] he did and it caused a big uproar at the time he said look this is a generational difference we don't feel the same way about privacy that our parents and grandparents did\nAnd people said that's that's wild that's not right privacy is built into the very nature of the United states and it's really embedded in the bill of rights and\nUm his belief was that it was as ... as it was often described an antique and that we needed to push people further there was in in the early days of Facebook there was a\nScene or a phrase that was bandied about called radical transparency the idea that you had to be\nAggressively transparent in order 'em to be modern the ... the sense was as one person to put it um [noise] you know that in the future because of Facebook and other things like it that were exploding the boundaries of privacy that extramarital affairs would become impossible people couldn't hide things like that they could no longer hide\nTheir lives outside of work from their lives and work and they believe that\nBut that put them at odds with the public and and the key fact I think was that over and over again Mark Zuckerberg believed that being at odds with the public was not assigned you were doing something wrong it was a sign that you were doing something innovative and their\nTheir ... their motto of course became move fast and break things and that motto really captured the way that they see the world that\nAlmost like redefining what it is to be him on [laughter]\nYeah they believe that this that this tool Facebook had that kind of power and and and they came to being at a time in Silicon Valley where were you had this almost messianic\nSense of ambition this belief that that you weren't just building computer applications you were actually building tools that were fundamentally reshaping society and they embrace that wholeheartedly\n[noise] there was a recent data breach at Facebook\nWhere fifty million users information was taken by somebody how how serious a problem as this [noise]\nThis is a serious one this is the largest security breach in Facebook's history and what was unusual about this and what sets it apart from other cases like Cambridge Analytica was that this was outright fast this was a case of hackers or hacker we still don't know who it was um [noise]\nFinding essentially an an under protected door and walking through it and taking control of\nAt least fifty million Facebook user accounts or Facebook also\nI'm to be safe or took another forty million users in and kick them off the force them to log back in so it may be as many as Ninety million or more that were affected by this and and in this case the hackers were able to get total control\nOf the accounts so ah there they were able to get control of your privacy settings they could go into your messages they could post things on your behalf they at this point Facebook says they haven't found any evidence of these hackers\nDoing that so that only heightens the mystery they don't know why they did it they don't know if this was a foreign government or if this were individuals' if this was a criminal act\nUm but what's interesting about this particular case and why really leaps out to people who studied the history of Facebook\nIs it a few years ago Facebook might not have gone public with this as fast as they did they would have they would have probably investigated it more internally but under the new rules that have been been imposed by the European Union um they were required to announce this very fast and as a result they had to talk about this breach a release\nFresh air as Dave Davies recorded with Evan

committee contacted Facebook shortly after the election and said he really wanted to talk about the role of of Russian interference\nOn Facebook and as he put it to me they were completely dismissive they they just didn't believe that they had a serious role to play here\nI'm over time they have come to understand that that simply not the case they initially they estimated that about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal time maybe you could just explain that a bit I mean Facebook makes a fortune by digital ads how does it work yeah\nIn some ways Facebook is actually a little bit like a newspaper in the sense that the way that it pays for itself is by running ads alongside the content that people post in and look for on there so [noise]\nOn any given moment when you go on Facebook you will find these highly targeted ads these are things that are chosen just for you based on your browsing behavior around the Internet based on the post that you clicked on the things that you look for\nUm they choose ads that you are much more likely to click on then you would if they were just sending the same out to everybody else and that formula that ability to micro target as it's known\nA adds to specific users has been this extraordinary geyser of business success they they'd just stumbled on something that was I'm able to generate returns for companies that kept them coming back over and over again an advertising on Facebook\nAnd the company is taking steps certainly says it's taking steps to monitor the the content I'm that political players are using the platform for and that you know\nIs arguably critical as we approach the midterms it's also pretty tricky right I mean how do you distinguish spin from Faye Korea or you know dangerous content from distasteful how's the company\nI'm doing this [noise] it's become this consuming effort or you know Facebook over the last year as they as the controversy has grown they've undertaken one initiative after another so when it comes to political election\nUh advertising for instance what they said was okay even though for years we argued that we shouldn't have to disclose the funding sources for political ads now we are going to not only do that but we are going to go farther than TV does we're going to let users be able to click on an ad and then no not only who paid for it but what other ads to those people\nPay for and and who were they targeting\nUm they're also saying we're going to do more to defend against the kind of disinformation campaigns what they call coordinated inauthentic behavior essentially\nUm misinformation it's distributed to try to shake elections not only the United states but in other countries and they've had to in in in many ways Dave it's almost like they've put gun to take on some of the qualities of a government you know they've had to hire people who actually worked in the U.S government on things like misinformation [noise]\nUm in order to try to ferret out efforts by Russian officials who are are in one case it was\nAfter the midterm elections in the U.S and and the elections that come to follow our whether or not that's that's working um and I think what's interesting is so Facebook on has become much more public these days in terms of talking about when it finds examples of disinformation it'll announced it will say we took down a group of\nRussian I'm In pastors who were seeking to affect American voting behavior for instance um but that's either a sign that they're winning the battle or it's a sign that the battle has grown so much that they're going to continue to face this and and what I'm struck by is how much\nThe integrity and the credibility of elections now rests on the shoulders of individual employees inside a private company in California that's a very unusual situation for our democracy to be in\nBecause they can actually make distinctions about what what the public sees and what it doesn't\nYes yeah I mean they have to make very subtle choices ... take for example the you know misinformation what is the definition of misinformation when it's somebody being wrong by accident and when it's somebody being wrong on purpose when are they trying to deceive large numbers of public\nThose kinds of very subtle things which are usually the province of the Supreme Court or of lawmakers are now being handled in

they've tried to do is to say okay we're we're going to punish hate speech we're going to prevent hate speech from being on here um but for things that are less than hate speech if it's just
