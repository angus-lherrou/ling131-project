Blacksburg who's also the show runner seasons five is now a net flicks Comedy Central and national and the first season the Syrian satirizing Hollywood\nAccents on CNN five is set in the era of the me too movement\nBow jak horsemen takes advantage of the kind of characters that you can pull off in an animated series it's a world that is a mix of people and talking animals with human characteristics bow jak is a horse and became famous as the star of the nineties sitcom horsing around\nBut when season one of bull jak horsemen begins bull jak as washed up his celebrity has faded and he spends a lot of time drinking feeling sorry for himself and watching old reruns of a sitcom horsing around admiring how great he was on the show back then\nLet's start with a clip from the very first episode of Bo jak horsemen when Bo jak as a guest on Charlie Rose shall\nBe Nineteen any type of situation comedy horses around from years on ABC Show which young bachelor horses forced to reevaluate its priorities we were used to raise three human children was initially dismissed by critics is wrong and suffering and not good\nBut the family comedy struggled America someone on the air for nine seasons the star of horses around ... or ... ...\nIt is good to be here Charlie [laughter] Raphael Bob Blacksburg welcoming the fresh air time changes how we see things nothing that we were you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be\nAccused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job [laughter]\nSo let's just start with a surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode when the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know look at bow jak through such a mess and all of Rio and unprofessional and Charlie Rose up ... ... ... is our our straight person in the scene\nAnd uh yeah when the allegations are against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause there wasn't it was truly oh no Charlie Rose and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it is interesting now to to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nSo how did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress NBC\nThe idea for the show really started from my friendship with Lisa ... who was a brilliant illustrator and cartoonist and I have been friends with her since high school and when I was you know in Los Angeles pitching shows around\nUm she was living in Brooklyn at the time and one thing she was doing was drawing these animal people on her own and posting them in her blog and on the Internet and I thought they were just so gorgeous the designs of these characters which we're human from the neck down more or less with these the animal heads\nSounds right it's a suicide attempt at a plausible deniability like he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a parking but maybe minor distinction to us that he is so despondent despairing that he is willing to do this but not so much that he is going to actively do it himself [noise]\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season five which he wrote if I'm an unusual episode because it's one long monologue bow jacks mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dimension and low jak does not feel warmly toward her\nSo this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium Adam Mike her coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about on these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both Maine to both jak [noise]\nI I I Want to play a three part of his ... and ... as well or not as much jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horsing around seriously though hold your applause well held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sarah Lynn\nAnd it was about these orphans in early on the network at a note maybe don't mention they're orphans so much because audiences tend to fight orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they couldn't imagine their parents to be anything they want it said something to learn for\nAnyway we did this one season finale we're Olivia's birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got herself cleaned up and she was to be the live your life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted him anyway the worst tries to want to be careful\nMoms have a way of letting you do but Olivia\nJust thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moved to California Olivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced because they're bused Olivia gone for good but of course because it's a TV show not gone for good chorus because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and they had to go back to rehab facility\nBecause what are you going to do is just not handled Libya on the show\nShould have happy endings sitcoms not really because if everyone's happy to show would be over and above all else the show has to keep going there's always more show and you can call horse in the round dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more\nShow I guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's coughing you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broken your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that I'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when you said early in that clip\nThat um he ended our our fans because they could imagine their parents anyway they wanted to [noise] um what made you think about that\nWell you know I I I think a big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ed and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and even in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself\nAnd I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of you know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think\nWhat's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe on a personal level level that nobody is era deem Abul ... or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better\nAnd be forgiven and how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've hurt so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption\nAnd I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least or a really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement which sounds so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter] I'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the series\nPeople who need to apologize for saying would you describe ... the\nLead for sure but we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards\nThat celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from I think for time forgiving recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer or winter talking about how the additives that our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things\nAnd they're able to kind of likes linked back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized at and then over the course of the last year it started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry and then just in the last\nMonth or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe we'll forgive me I don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years\nWhat makes me think that people are being forgiven again well\nUh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remark is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her is use of of racial slurs\nIn mystified me in this area that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable that it still feels like we are not you know Luis C K A stand up set a little way back and got a standing ovation\nA there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would personally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back\nAnd do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I found a tremendously upsetting\nJack horsemen after a break he'll tell us why he had second thoughts about some of the jokes from season one and

S. um tell us about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother on to a Jewish gifted in book store\nCalled Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto in the surrounding area and so I really you know what I Would go and visit to the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books\nAnd and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school um you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never once felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um she would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of minorities that were\nCause it's missing an end to have the the misfit toys go um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life um and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas disconnect me between being told about anti Semitism and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated [laughter] now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes\nUm and\nIt's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country\nAnd they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me but also scary how little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who you know as\nA Jew or the story of the Holocaust is over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who are shocked when their own neighbors\nStarted you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them in cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nYou know actually one of the Jews control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nI sat at 'cause there's people that live at and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years it'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nIt was it difficult for you to concentrate\nI could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested in me I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience and I love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't ...\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize what an appropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants don't fit inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy here pushing the boundaries I did because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified\nThat oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just a shouting out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's\nA ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it and I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a tension has been a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference between you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders and it's not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not oh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this\nPrecisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have you know\nMe and I I still am not quite sure\nWhat was to me like a safe space for you or you could like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like there's so many pop culture references\nAnd bow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nUm that made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there is a a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here\nBut on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it\nEven if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely was a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate\nIf I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this seem that I was living in feel like the scenes but I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful as being a writer and having an outlet and now\nIf I Am in a situation I think if the funny thing I can write it down\nAnd say oh I'm going to hold onto this and a lot of character said later I don't need to say it to the person in this moment or if I think it's a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give it away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting it on a story later so having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central is running bow jak which is the Netflix series now the comedy central is rain yet starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you test you in retrospect like some of the jokes and season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYou know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks\nAnd making or the right time for Comedy Central\nAnd you know obviously want them to keep their dignity as it up sort of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this work without this moment and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out um but\nHopefully people you know as they have been bracing for showing that folks will embrace the show on Comedy Central and if there are flaws with it they will see those laws for what they are and you know we'll see what happens\nWhen it's been great to talk with you thank you so much\nIt is my pleasure thank you so much\n...

the actual facts um but it's one of the actual documents entirely new financial mirror to forty for Roosevelt\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David Barstow of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on our President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans you got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped origins from his father

you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter\nSays and crack and David Barstow two of the three writers\nWho reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how it is self made\nMillionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father funneled to him and another siblings and how it came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager [noise]\nOkay so in addition to some attack schemes we talked about I'm Fred Trump made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump\nEmpire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws [noise]\nUh we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars crates two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars and direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to Don and what we what we also saw but I think what is important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never repaid him and he would take out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that in his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to for Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then off being off to the races [noise]\nThese are loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that with loan from his father\nYeah he use the money for\nMany of his ventures the how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support died it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially like at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and this is the time he not only on the bank hundreds of millions of dollars\nUm he was in debt to his father was going to just father these very crucial times\nFor more support\nTo me get a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and ended up in debt and a lot of instances instead of making a fortune ...\nAlso see that when he fell you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety and there was there to catch them there's ones picked just\nThe you know the background of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump has incredible financial distress in numbers as companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case\nI'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment infrared Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino trips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money ... million dollars' worth if it was a chat room and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's well centrally and knew well and it was caught us all to the will is taken to Fred Trump's host in December of Nineteen Ninety\nInfrared Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk\nAnd Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he make the call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor fried Trump's Whelan puts Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump\nIn charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life after all his father has done for him but he makes this move to incredibly dramatic move and\nScarring to the family and what he did\n[laughter] so what you're saying I think that at the end of Fred Trump's life were toward the end of ...\nLife Donald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bailing himself out and Fred tromp Donald's father became suspicious of this and that he had helped with so much money on for so many are\nWhat we know for sure is that spread Trump perceived to this as an attempt by his um to Jane\nComplete control over his estate and potentially to use the empire that Fred Trump doggedly and patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm protests\n[noise] [noise] I guess or New York times reporters David Barstow and Suzanne ... after a break we'll talk about another scheme used to transfer of wealth from Fred Trump's real estate empire to his children

Suzanne crack and David Barstow who along with rescue near published a long investigative article this month but ... ...\nMeasured in today's dollars received about four hundred Thirteen million\nAnd then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why did Donald Trump make that decision [noise] to\nThe interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that for a Trump very much wanted this empire\nTo stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his doubt that they would keep it and I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting and they had regular family meetings after Trump died they would hand out ... you know Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale to a developer in New York for almost all of it and it was told you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSince ... the the uh buildings that were sold ... those buildings ... own at the time of his dad's out there are also include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThat included both of buildings that had been transferred down the ones that he owned it was it was pretty much his all empire\nAnd it sold them you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer named ... and the price tag was just over seven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about died as we learned through the the the documents that we went through the thoughts sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value it out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that died empire was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that down as Donald Trump made it definitely wasn't so the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this\n\nIt's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the low valuations they placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning a few million more bucks on that return\nBut the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a recession and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families should hire\nThe most expensive legal on accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated maneuvers to avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more that's the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more\nMeanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of simply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts especially hit the people who are looking at gift in a state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art video yard with a comeback or the printing and tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books are they shall based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking damn it out of the combat go for it [noise]\nI don't want to say he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven minutes of this story of his sort of\nYou know pulling himself up and I'm Out of the mark of his casino collapse\nAnd through shows grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book so happens to coincide with the time when\nThey actually took possession of one quarter of his father's real estate's\nIt's just a moment when he's boasting about\nYou know his daring do of cutting himself off the map\nIt actually cause it's perfectly lives in a moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent of this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money might\nNot happen in two thousand and four I'm right in the sale had gone through the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Fred Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that fried shrimp belt and paid for [noise] I'm Wondering\nHow you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making\nAbilities [noise]\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting forward\nFinesse it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've reset dot I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's\nWell but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the\nThe power of the story is you know I think the how careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up\nI think it's really hard to refute the story um it's hard for a few because it's absolutely true and the documents are there and in a lot of them are other source documents with the Trump family themselves [noise]\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off the air\nFrom that you got access knew were locked up in this room um who cleaned it\nAllowed to go you know\nWe uh we did not have the cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come into one day with a with a little vacuum in and\nOut of it but we uh yeah it was uh just the three of us for a year um with a yeah it's pretty Matthew ... who writes American\nIdol costs are focused here I'd imagine [laughter] other people now are you were locked up in this room [noise] um actually people\nKnew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh it was it was difficult everybody you know these people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we
