campaign manager for Donald Trump requested proposals from an Israeli company to create fake online identities\nAnd use social media manipulation helped defeat Trump's rivals for the Republican nomination in the primary and Hillary Clinton in the general election\nThe proposals were apparently never acted on but we know that Russian operatives made effective use of Facebook and Twitter and seeking to influence the twenty six\nRelated by millions fake social media accounts promoting messages that are slanted or even made up\nI guess today pi Wu singer and Emerson booking say that social media has also been weaponized in ways that most of us remain unaware of like feeling popular uprisings and affecting the course of military campaign\nFor instance when the Israeli Army moved into Gaza and twenty twelve the operation was supported by a viral marketing campaign\nBWI finger as a strategist at New America a consultant for the U.S military and intelligence community and the author of several books Emerson T booking writes about conflict and social media and was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations\nEspecially as Dave Davies spoke to them about their new book like war the weaponization of social media\nWill Peter Singer and Emerson broken welcome to fresh air\nYou know we we all know that social media have become a big tool in politics but you write in his book that it can affect not just opinions and reputations but the course of war and you cite a fascinating example a new rapid communications medium\nTransforming the military offensive is was the German invasion of France what happened [noise]\nSo you had this new technology that are connected everything from tanks to airplanes or to the broader population is wireless communications and radio proved to be the secret sauce so to speak for everything from the political changes\nOr the rise of not seeing them go bulls a said that it wouldn't have been possible what they did without the radio but it also Hodge strategic tactical military impact\nOr when the Germans invades France an invasion that most people didn't at the time I didn't think would work\nIt not only allows them to connect all their military units in a new manner allow him to coordinate and move faster than ever before but it also connected back into the enemy population and it spread a contagion of fear\nAnd it's one of the things that the contemporaries described as this this strange defeat um they couldn't express what happened until they figured out really radio was what caused all cause of the world to change and\nWe saw many of the same things play out in the rise of ISIS at a broader level but also it's a million\nAs a multiple times bigger it's part of these ways social media is in effect change the world\nLet's talk about that the ISIS invasion of Iraq and particularly when they were advancing on the city of Mosul how did they use social media to their benefit\nConversations on we chat another Chinese platforms and basically cede positive things about the Chinese government\nEmerson broken writes about conflict in social media he was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations Peter Singer is a strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nWill

W. P. B. dot org and everybody wins an W. P. B. dot org thank you for your support\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with the W. singer a strategist at New America and a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nYou look at the Israeli incursion into Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign\nAnd they were hip to the importance of this what did they do so it was actually a the twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes the true picture myself to this subject to virtually and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUm this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign the campaign to twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level a mosque militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but it's what is unusual is it the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time or a mosque Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation command as Israel would strike particular targets it would put out\nI must would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides\nBut also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the proxies if one side or another\nTen million and all and the first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region and this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and it's set a model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding\nWhose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out but importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and ... out\nAnd see a targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nEssentially they change by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you pull put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message or residents\nSo originally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a how they're losing this bottle of narrative that was very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they've reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units are\nIn fact one of the fund a images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet mediums and the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organization\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serving the cars and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from ah Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlist in an online army and get you know what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can enlist in Taylor Swiss army of swift ...\nYou can enlist in the Israeli defense forces on line army the uh caused may not be the same but the tactics are and by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe mosques one poll from the world at at crowd sources so to speak\nAnd one of the other tools of the trade one of the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and try and try and later on to it\nSo for example or you had the ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise\nFor a disease research and this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would tort rubble on your head\nYou would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of hijacking one discussion to drive it through your own in\nThe same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a ... World Cup and jumped into it to the same way that Trump's online army which trying hijacked discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the interview fresh as Dave Davies included repeat W singer and Emerson breaking authors of the new book like war the weaponization of social media\nAbout social media in political campaigns after a break and John Powers will review the newfound twenty two July based on the story of a terrorist attack on a summer camp in Norway and two thousand eleven\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThan you've our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from this station from logged me in makers and go to meeting the collaboration meeting platform that comes equipped with teachers to help people stay focused to get work done [noise]\nLearn more you go to meeting dot com\nAnd from home advisor matching homeowners with home improvement professionals for a variety of home projects from minor repairs to major\nRemodeled homeowners can read reviews of local pros and book appointments on line at home advisor dot com\nSometimes you love short sirt cakes shirt grabs certain meetings how 'bout certified drive\nYou got it the one day fun drive is Thursday you don't have a certain way and in fact there is no waiting at all donate now at ... dot org and your ...

recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations also with us pi Wu senior strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media [noise]\nYou know I'm interested in your sense of how social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived um\nYour social media feeds during the comment on hearing in many ways that felt like a war going back and forth and uh it was in a certain way you had both sides using\nThe exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military we're using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where ah they were and lifting\nThe online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together and they wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd source hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out\nWho sat next to Kevin off to a unpack this stream story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket debt\nThen you've got the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data to basically push this narrative or the ... or narrative that a doctor Ford or the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was\nNow that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe spread of disinformation\nThe spread of alternative theories the idea of bearing the truth underneath a sea of lies it's something that for example Russia's specialized again\nAnd again you solve both sides engaging in this in the cabinet debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona is in the like and the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side the narrative\nBe buried underneath you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself or at least the online place that we go to a stylish and learn about history we compete ya so for example in the book where the story of how after the rash and shoot down an airliner over Ukraine Russian um actors go on to a PDF very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nI mean think played out during the ... hearing where ah he used the term I'm In is a high school yearbook it was sexual term\nAnd during his hearing he said no no no no it's not a sexual term it's about a drinking game the problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game until someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo look\nEvidence on week a PDF to make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kind of tactics utilized again because both sides not only used them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms are private companies are and they're now coming to terms with the fact that they play\nLike it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um and that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nSo neural networks is part of this larger ah area of research that people will talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just men back but maybe in some way surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used a like any other technology for both good and bad or\nSo for example they can um create a wonderful imagery and seen images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nUm and it's very powerful and use of for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas uh like customer service um the company the this also as a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same I chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a convince someone to take a certain position on a war\nA certain way to challenge also moved into visual imagery there was an area known as deep fake these are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made steam that never happened\nAnd so with human finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies and\nGet the strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome the origin of social networks are online we're a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to say I ... back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nRight so so so these neural networks ... could be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce the picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden offering some you know profane of comment at something\nTo get real world examples of this there have already been creations of speeches that a bronco Obama never gave\nOr there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together\nWhere for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger to uh George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take that to meld together to allow you to a in essence created a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in the space it's going to be used for good for jokes for a laugh it's going to be monetize for for profit\nAnd it's also going to be weaponized\nEmerson broken ...

I mean you're hearing alarms go off your hand banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not climate at all inside the space caps on a recent lesson than\nSitting in a capital a bit about the sound design for teams like the one we've been talking about\n[laughter] yeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void now that that that is a space\nI'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know a decision hyper speed kind of beam me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of uh making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we want it to kind of try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of would augment the sound you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really\nImmerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile but uh but I also think kind of trying to continually reminded audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nA little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts art something better just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from my feeling is\nStay meant about the death of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\n'em and tell you know they basically standing as astronaut off into space helping their land on the moon but if they don't they don't Nassar's preparing you know basically a eulogy and pressing the repeal edgy\nUm get get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you can find the or ... you know you can search it online in a van of moving disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a\nUntil the sheet of paper you see a you see a a given Heinz who plays ... movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um uh that you can uh again that you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to capture relates in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and just kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech says basically a U.S from now on anyone who looked up at the at the moon will know that there's some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intended that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time it's incredible kind of hope and that sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave adventures could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil Armstrong new at NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they\nA live their lives and and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots are astronauts you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world conversations that they sometimes have to have\nA any sort of service for country often involves now or at least that risk and it's\nIt's something I think it's helpful to to remind people off\nI guess just ... he directed the new film first man and wrote and directed at la la land and whiplash\nSweet I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\nThe Newbery Family Foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from this station and from tire Iraq with more than five hundred tire modeled from twenty to manufacturers\nAnd an online tool for finding tires based on vehicle meets budget and brand\nTire rock dot com helping drivers find deliver install [noise]\nI'm from TI eighty eight CIA is committed to helping those who are driven by purpose reached their definition of success\nInvesting advice\nBanking retirement learn more T.

choice in our lives better choice not a political one too focused on meals private moments on the moon ah during that time\nHe wanted to spend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even drawn down and then after his famous wine or his an sort of plan to walk off to the little west grader during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras a and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about it I didn't know about before researching those\nUm those are the things I think they were really important to us in terms of in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase who not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was the product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nAnd I guess is Damien says now he directed the new movie first man and wrote and directed la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a

directed the new movie first man starring Ryan Gosling Neil Armstrong the first human to walk on the moon\nI Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think there's I mean they can\nActually brought with him to play after the space landing on my right about that this has music he plays on the way to them\nIt's called lunar Rhapsody yup and when I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes under that category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices a therapy and this incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your point of the moon and playing like really corny\nVersion of what you know women are might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange I I Am somebody you know the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked distract and uh I think what's interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal and the other astronaut to play during the course of their mission they played a piece from by divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune or something I was actually a Neal and Janet or listen to two together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know who was having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly\nPlay distracted really no one listening no Mitch control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for\nThe the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nOkay well why don't we hear a a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called women or Rhapsody\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd interactivity which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and the teams in the new movie first manned missions directed by ... inches out lots of direct did a lot of land and where did too and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and I have found remarkable was that you were working on our land before first man but a lot of land with a turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first men are and so you know that that was you know a few years until all the way it's kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know I've\nBeen trying to get a made for a while and with no success and and a three laws stops and starts in and uh and during that time I uh I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a\nFirst manned by Japan sending\nA fell in love with that and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in play Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way I also hear ah\nYou're into musicals you at the musical script and I said oh yeah you like these goals that I Love Gene Kelly and we talked about Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first manned a lot of land\nBut as soon as I learned was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and ah we jumped right into that\nSo I'm finally what brings you must joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there is so much technical staff you had to deal you know it's like sound effects and we producing 'em\n... it's it's it's you know la la land was a complex film but that's because of the choreography in a camera work and dreamy sequences this is like technically difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean I I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was a little bit the the responsibility of the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat uh uh and and and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal is kids were going to see this film you know they'd been very helpful with us\nAll through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film but they were going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure onscreen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they wanna see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just to kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under myself and all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder to you know really get it right and pay proper tribute to ah to these people\nYou mentioned al thank you so much for talking with that that's been great to have you back on our shown congratulations on thank you so nice
