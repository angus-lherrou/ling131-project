N. Y. [noise]\nHey I'm ... Barton Robert Krulwich radiolab and today\n[noise] they're\nGonna start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before and say something high\n[laughter] [laughter] okay I think it's good All right\nWhere we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking of start at the beginning yeah starts again what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nThere is growing outrage tonight after an armed African American teenager was shot and killed when that became a national\nThere was a lot of ... and the press how many people do we see killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps as accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics\nOn police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings and it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire\nAmir arrived Jason Harris than about John become\nSort of a national story\nI personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nThere a is a trendy one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply you know the problem is we don't know we have no idea\nIt's similar when the police turn itself and the police department it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way up by a broader agency and I could tell you how many\nPurse snatching there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted for department of law enforcement\nBut I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody now there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBurned so first study had Florida the third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country\nAnd Florida has wonderful public records loss\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and so we got prevent sat down or an email and every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida and\nThree hundred and eighty eight emails\nAsking for five years worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that should not for\nThis involves a year of work do you how many police departments who's getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that involved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThing then put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of\nFlu show that [noise] for a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times always with them writer to check it out yeah how many how many accidents you think you have sitting on this to probably five thousand pages a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me sit six feet tall\nWe got him broken down by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B county ... on the beach uh all\nThe way through the alphabet he basically just have a all games or mental folders with tons of papers and by the costs and entire desk and the combination\nOf ah use the force reports civil court records and media clippings to represent a eight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the one in six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise] so he did was go through all of this material\nI'm circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team [noise]\nDidn't involve a an arm stuff's pact or chase [noise] all the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people are hit by those poets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions\nDidn't all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at will last link to it from my website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found it initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe said if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case huh we also broke these down into category\nAnd he says you know what you see like on the most basic level are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking the gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds any time of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they called suicide by cops which is where somebody who's usually are mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm gonna make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shoe size right this is something that people will cover police apparently know quite\nWell you know the news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the numbers say about race ice\nPercent of people shot by police are black and that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics you know what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent it's more like Seventeen that's right\nWhich means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for the same demographics and it's we sat there going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very far ... percent six ... he says one ... year it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the proper\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what would I guess means like that I don't know it's back to where we were in why we want to start\nThis mapping asked him I feel just moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise]\nI mean they're all written in this ah employment investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler receive a columnist or to Cato Darryl police speak our approach department to fifty five is confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife and apartment to fight it out of every one of these every report says at least one human life someone was either you know [noise] more often than not gravely injured or killed a tree have on the table that the investigation of death [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one people who [noise]\n\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off in Montgomery giant boulders to act to follow wherever those stories might lead\nGuilty and then traveled around Florida and a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics you heard and today we're going to bring you one of those stories and if you're interested after this episode you can head to our website radiolab dark and you can hear part two of the series where we follow a totally different story than the one where\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply trying to find our way crystal gathered like probably Fifteen\nOf us into the tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my\nGrief you can either get the um the larger stage at certain point was talking to him in and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house of like a like some deep [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just think when I go to my house she set the stage comes around I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over the crystal [noise]\n\nMid sized one story house in ... and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like they bring with them you know their own stories these stories of creep up suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun [noise]\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel room again this is Natasha Clinton we started to fail for eight hours of sleep\nIn each other bad on the couch you know I'm an American it becomes like a huge sleep over and we're going to see for up to talk eight you know getting to know each other and we are the children like therapy for us\nTo keep that in the past but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really\nStuck with me I Believe we're at a sex Marlin problems\nAnd it was when Krista let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars [noise]\nAbout twelve people and\nAbout eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy perhaps we need a video\nWe came and he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetable garden 'cause the guard and once they invest emotional\nAnd all that but I I Am\nThen 'cause um when they when they you know when I took him away in released into down the type of stuff we came back here is all you can smell was playing echo now like when you play any like it's it's not it's it's not as bad now but just the association like when I'm paid onions and you get that smell like it just\nYou get those flat ... times and it brings you right back here mhm yup [noise] in the toilet was just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\n\nGoes I just started ... when it started to cry [noise]\n\n\nThen you don't want me to a Texan yeah my mind a bit about what about on the me\nA couple of women had to be their phones may\nAnd it's\nProbably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face a three to one\nThree two one [noise]\nThen we all started walking back to put the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just daring\nWeather but I Know [noise]\nHave actually yeah I Know yeah we haven't been I had\nIt was also graced by we brought a once a week and I threw a clock in the morning [noise]\nWhat I remember being like to tell you how do you live so far away\nOh my gosh I Would have that was [noise]\nAnd my son's waited for about Fifteen minutes\nTo go there all the time\nI mean I Know what you do you want to go\nAnd sit there yeah and it's crazy because by it but with an s a cemetery like a little bit further out\nIn his credit you can do about it as like a certain time every\nDay and it's a little while you share\nEverything that he literally I think he does he like go have lunch with every day\nI don't know if it's a it's a little while I got to always say not\nTaking care\n\nSo the trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and I don't think I happened to be there at the really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip\n[noise] or you\nCan either repeal with the mother Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nChewed on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother I watch\nWas loaded into the ground\nAnd it was run attended a few of these women started call themselves the mother's moving [noise]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\n\nIt was weird because in the short amount of time\nThing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nKind of felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\n\nComing up a cop with a gun a man with a knife\nAnd look at the razor thin life or death moment between the\nCoasts\nThis is Christopher calling from South

provide information sample home trend options in one place for and certainly not prevent that dot com\n[noise]\n\n\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot I wanted to learn from your best shot if you want to die I Want you want to die you can die\nHe told the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can't kill\nTheir fan of our [noise] how do you want to\nBe to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the un\nSaid this is the thing that you guys will you use this video for what I just want of a multitude of videos that we show all because there is when the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers used timing distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans in the current judge that one I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away to use verbal commands first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important to their guys partner was holding a gun have you heard that hot you might have just been totally reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to rest of the communication with your fellow officers and those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek Derek Derek isn't\nJust a black man shirtless with a knife and at the end when there's no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name was in the face listen I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of a report that made the officer think how he's gonna\nAnd I was packing up she told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nMight get through the neighborhood if you want to miss it on the front step waves I mean ... what I Do mean Derrick does your stupid set up a bit you and how close came to be in that wouldn't be backwards medication wasn't doing drugs that he was just ... me and you are in you\nKnow again uh almost kinda like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because there was just a few months after I left\nLast friday election among the winners they told us he says he has now lives in the county will share my shit would was elected the sheriff of Linn county\n[noise]\nWhich is the county that they turn of the longs to him and the other thing to mention is that a job with long says organization called her which has decreased executive research forum big coalition appreciate a and a twenty six team put out\nWhat they called her thirty guiding principle for these forests and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is sanctity\nOf human life [noise]\nYou know just a month after ... put out this principle two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy peed International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job in somebody's principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the colonel or please started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago\nHuh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have I've become kind of a political force you has also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America or at least maybe slowly rat but cumulatively it\nDoes I hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and I sort of felt the same way too but\n[noise] there was this experience than I had read realized how far [noise]
