I mean young\nI'm like I didn't have gotten so many chicks when I was really exactly\nThe opposite I was I was a ... [noise]\nOkay so he reads the poll found that way deep in the corner of his mind that's what about Twenty years publishing [noise]\nThey become very popular the publisher decided to have it translates into the number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden one day that home popped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is it what is the challenge okay what I meant was to\nSay well here's the thing he says you've got this problem money none\nOf them doesn't look if you just focus on the word basically it's just the guy talking to a younger girls saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like president who says rule the piece of ... which you to open your doors get out into the world in order to get out of bed\nEats and jam will be too so you don't look so pale about had to lose your plump shaped cattle dog or you know they're like get better here's to your good health\nDue to want something done I mean young\nJust saying those words in English misses the whole spirit of the ... the tone the light hearted nuts and this is key for dug it also known as the bones form it's wonderfully catchy little\nAnd uh the first line many young is identical to the last line I mean young to sort of has the feel of a ... it has the poets name in the middle of the poems in on the ... oh and I did I say three syllables per lawyer didn't ya ya or us three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long\nSo all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and quickly became\nEmbroiled in the question of like how do you translate this coming along the way even began to make a little grids possibilities for different lines at the pound for example as I see on the top ... like this line that basically says don't wallow in bed\nI had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here instead\nOf hurting blood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in instead of looking in Europe instead of going out of instead of hurting their can in the dead of squirming in in the head of slurping sloppy and him dead of burning up in bed instead of turning in bed\nOn and on and I came up with you want me to read my proves translation please my sweet dear I send cheer all the best\nYou're forced to rest dislike jail so don't ale very long just get strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick ban your ache for my sake\nButtered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best sooner rise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise health be near my sweet dear\nSo clay Mars now Douglas playing all became Douglas and I I like the jam became bread though the bread and butter butter bread yeah well I just figure jam and jelly they are words\nBut the words represent concepts and the concept of a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your implicitly talking about bread and things that you spread\nIt on oh ... some people like just stick their fingers and jelly\nNo bread needed OK okay fair enough\nLike he hadn't quite nailed it ... to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named oddly enough Bob French [laughter] and I said hey Bob\nLet me send my embrace quit display dark halls and bank\nIn soft they'll regain help\nDress and fleet off Clement who called\nVery different in tone and really quite marvelous\nHe got the pale face in there you got to a gym Clements name in the middle\nBut at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient\nWhich you could argue well it's an ancient pounds but Doug says no no there's a bigger problem was\nThirty lines long so extra long and twenty eight was a sacrosanct number so that's just you line so no no no no no claim on my whole road at three syllable Paul I'm uh twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was\nA form rather than a a than a message that is the message was get\nWell which is pretty simple but Doug would argue it with the farm that's what made the things funny charming and so the question for him was who could get the feel but nailed it for him he ended up sending the pull him out to like sixty people\nDoctoral students who my sweet I treat one regard Otis hard dear colleagues friends chicken D.

government and it's a serious policy [noise] thank you very much appreciate it and it seemed to me\nMaybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what are you kidding me not being serious\nWe put it in a number of requests to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response\nDo you think he was aware of the misunderstanding to carry on this uh this fellow oh yeah no I followed him out afterwards [noise]\nMy name is ... he's a young guy in the twenties he's an independent journalist yeah I used to work in different newspapers and I'm\nLike you know when you when you\nListen what happened there and I felt like some kind of cultural a guide me\nThat Americans think serious means\nI'm standing here I'm not joking I'm Serious when when African things be serious and I'm using a generally they say no or you could and not just speak are you going to do\nIs is just exactly my point is going to take sanctions maybe the youngest son's

after that press conference he did get strange calls to his home and some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he better rethink what he said\nThat they started learning about it going to go on that issue and that\nThey said you should line up with the government's priority yeah these messages were from the government ... it's hard to tell it has been reported that the Ethiopian anti terrorism task force will waged\n... out of the ones that seem to these kind of makes it\nAnd were they threatening\nYeah some of them where you know we've been getting bigger

called shell shocked new product ... now you're try\nThis one a Robert Krulwich anti British distilling wheeler talked to a writer Adam Gopnik about George Carlin twice George Carlin mentioned\nOh because Carl and it's a wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language you're talking about the comedians of comedy comedians\nIs about the English language it's about little expressions we use we ... we all stay in the little sayings and expressions that we use all the\nTime I was just one of his great subject really seemed to examine these expressions and all the more interesting 'cause he was he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he got from like schooling and one of\nGOP next favorite colonel in Russian I really like just want to just about how Carlin hated\nEuphemism I don't like words that hide the truth I don't like where's the conceal reality I don't like euphemisms and American English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality as Carlin was wonderful about things like that was about both she called me I've known\nPeople in this country no people we shift them all away\nAnd we brought in these\nCitizen\nPaintings on should be like the reason we use you if it's just been through my father in law died four months ago and we went through the same horrible dismissed that we all go through in intensive care ward where the doctors and\n... I mean she's dying right and we wanted to be comfortable means can we give them enough drug so the hill pass out before he dies and so on\nAnd so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise but Carlin's real point was that it it like does our reactions\nTo it that actually has like a kind of a negative fat and it gets worse with every generation we\nHave this whole business about um shell shock becoming pie TST no joke goes it's in four different things\nIn the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shocked simple ... directs language two syllables shell shocked and then it became battles for team\nBattled for the fourth of those now takes a little longer this doesn't seem to hurt as much and then after it became battle fatigue then it became operational exhausting [noise]\nHey we're up to age syllables now then it became post traumatic stress disorder [noise] ... we've added a hyphen and then it became peachy as post traumatic stress disorder that pain is completely buried under jargon\nThis was the or will notion that you could erase sensitivities if you blend it out the words so if you stop saying oh yeah we just tortured the guy if you save some\nFor some interrogation or enhanced interrogation that makes a big difference in part of a curling saying and stuff like now that his PATS Steve we're not having the appropriate reaction to it I mean its\nShell shocked I'll bet ya if we'd have still been calling a shell shocked some of those Vietnam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at that time\nShe says people see her in her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her\nCell I ah [noise]\nI hardly ever noticed that if people walking around me I feel like\nI'm just walking alone\nI can always here to ... and his sons attacks but not at a ...\nBut she says would you put the device on and put a sensor on her tongue [noise] the sidewalk\nCame alive at night it was amazing like I didn't\nKnow how many people are on the street at the same time his name to now they're all\nDown there again which she described them in a way that sounded\nAlmost like a painting [noise] like\nReally soft and everything that sounds nice soft projects and [noise]\n\nThey're walking and I can see the last movie and I can see them again [noise] but I couldn't see them clear you know like I can I say if teachers during [noise] what they're wearing a shirt or a short sirt\nStress and I just like [noise]\n[noise]\nI had imagined somehow like underwater creatures squishy jellyfish Mike [noise] yeah [noise]\nYeah [noise]\n\nYeah [noise]\n[noise]\nTo not friendly it's what it's like to translate the city with your tongue [noise] New York city becomes is a hazy the of walking fish that make their way along in the sunshine [noise]\n\n\nWe were lucky enough to get a video of Emily painting while using the brain port and you can check that out by going to radiolab dot org\nI'm not I don't\nKnow [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] this is Frank Gilmore calling from Reno nevada\nRadiolab to support by targeting presenting future at heart a new podcast that explores the work of change makers across the country and highlights projects in cities like Miami Washington DC and New York city for future at heart available on apple podcast or wherever pot cats are found\nTo have to get them back and radiolab is supported by progressive insurance committed to providing efficient tools to enable customers to bundle harm and auto insurance learn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressed that's now that's progress\n\n[noise]\nNa\n[noise]\n\n\n\nIn [noise]\n\n...
