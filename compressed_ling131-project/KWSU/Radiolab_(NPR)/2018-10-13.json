in I knew I wouldn't\nMuch like that yeah and so there was a certain ... that came during the audition and um and I got home and they called me that night while me that I had gotten the thing\nThat's why I did when you read the script for that first episode a guy walks into a psychiatrist's office yeah uh did you think well this was going to be an enormous cultural phenomena little change shape that delivers on for decades to come oh my God you're bait and\nOne of the things that we knew and we actually back in the interview some of the actors in the show and one of the things that everybody would hear about is that every actor in the Sopranos was terrified\nThat some day the David Chase or to the other producers would say come here we got to talk to you and they let you know that you are going to get whacked drank or your character they didn't actually kill any actors are\nOne of the guys who got killed and I will not say all of a sudden after that episode they started getting all these letters from Japan saying oh why did you kill off someone's Obama by a which seems sort of unusual and after a period of time it was all traced back to the actor\nToo and\nHe tried he tried to get the credit so you went right from the Sopranos and you did this as well I don't know who's right from the spread as soon as ... as you did this new show on Showtime called nurse Jackie which I about a nurse who had a among other things a drug problem and various other problems\nHave you ever like wanted you to play a normal nice person so much mind\nLuckily I don't spend a lotta time
