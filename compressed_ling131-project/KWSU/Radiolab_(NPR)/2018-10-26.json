N. Y. [noise]\nThree two one hey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have\nThis case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away it it gets under your skin this is Lisa learning I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nAt the Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenda pharaoh who brought us this story and under whose skin or he also seems to have got\nYeah it it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSearching Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist one newspaper guy for the post aren't going to fall he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the Adirondacks which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people did Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the Adirondack pulled off the road a aside wrote off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up too tense and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM didn't campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they signed up for this middle aged man peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer he had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he get\nThe other two campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing a semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah\nOf killed before and I'll kill again [noise] um I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees and he started marching the kids off into the woods took them into the woods near Brooke compare the two with him behind them are the kids of\nCourse we're scared out of their wits he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had each them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied [noise] so after we had the four people tied he went back\nTo the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip dumb blue ski because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was ...\nAnd then they heard filled with boys get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him what\nWas happening in in ... that can happen five times\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running Nick Fiorello ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David frame and he took\nThe boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch next to to kind of mind relation I guess so Freeman in um the killer laying in the dead chapter than our men come\nMeant that the other cancers the ones who have gotten away had managed to elect locals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted done a killer and treatment laying down and the debts and when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot and the man of the gun\nJust kind of stood up and calmly and clearly walked into the forest\nAnd not speak in\nWhat was at the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by\nIt was the scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down on manpower into a building patrols men\nArmed with with all kinds of weapons rifle shotgun bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods they intentionally signed the man's car and they're able to run the license plate when it comes back with an ID pay thirty seven year old Robert\nDarrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward to today she was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape temps seven years now armed with a thirty thirty rifle and nice and the story was\nOn every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday night when the people got panicked when you're all well one of the doors are shorter large people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fat let them figure it out last night and the day before that they left their tense up and left barbecue smoldering they left\nBehind coolers the bad guy down what happened was Carol was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred minutes\nThey're kind of closing in on him\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August nine Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... spotted gal\nDeep freeze or drop your gun something to that effect and Guerra started running\nBlocked fire four times got 'em in the back the arm and a foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw Darrow and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there\nBut it you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him and the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing but you wouldn't talk to this point that the story\nThat I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that it's so fascinating about this case doesn't law professor lethal urban again is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank our money frankly H R him when he ran a lawyer in Syracuse and never know whether to pronounce it or money or urban that Mary Armani Frank's wife\nAnd solve it they use urban but it is money\nA couple of months ago producers time and I learned I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York is our money's now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank our money and I was the attorney for Robert\nGirls um where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well we're just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nIt was a fighter I like ... flights go fight like standing up for the little guy and\nAnd tear it and you're doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation but then he met Robert gale\nYeah last year strong to take him out you need a forty five and uh I just had this fear I mean there's this guy is dangerous and a lot of things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented in at first on two pretty small things\nWind won a schoolteacher headless self to his trial he was sued the school\nAnd I talk to him out of it and then he had an automobile accident I represent amount that\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Gareth charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then he kept pick for [noise] um let's see some younger kids two very young girl it's ten eleven Darrell was released on bail he skipped a court date\nAnd just disappeared and then we pick up where we left off the murder the manhunt and an August ninth the night gal got captured Frank recall from Garrett was\nThen we went up to the back door [noise] took cubs\nDriving a lady friends car to try to lose the tail\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here this may be as far as\nWe can walk up to the polls abandoned mine [noise]\nGoing out there last February\nWith reporter Lauren McCain street and that tells you provide you with Mariah Tom's goes off because it's on a road that goes to the mind of their water to the mountains [noise] it wasn't that sort of hilly area off the side of the road this\nTrail corona you're just\nNot very likely that day this hair issues to be an old roadway [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills fairly deep never know leaves and all the trees were black and I'm very skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are mania and this is the only way they could've came in here so\nHere we are in our son do suits and every go tragedy choose for is looking for the\n[noise]\nSpent another ... works looking [noise]\nAnd then [noise]\nWe found her family well you see the shaft there they\nFind this air shaft which it was just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the ... the my coffee carefully and just as good and he said yeah\nOur money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those she held my feet and left me down and\nAnd as Frank got lower down into the whole\nI could see or sneak\nThe shoe simply sneaker [noise]\nAnd and and like I said to myself this good does it\nEnd he yells back up to ... get me outta here [noise] back up [noise]\n\nEventually ... down the other body ... body she was in a cemetery workout headset he left her but our money wasn't there with algae founder so what ensued\nWas a very long struggle where the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls ... yeah that play that out what what are your options shirt so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just care we took her to know to keep the concert ensues over wire under the current rules\nWhich have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality ... so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yeah it can be a little bit I can write\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up even if they have hired\nDetectors and even if a local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if people are already dead than you who built the law is ...\nThat's right\nA really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role\nIn that situation what your role in is to to play this part of the extent maybe which you are the one he stands up to the guy that everybody else even if everybody hates you even if maybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to\nDo your job and not job it could be in the role of the person that fight as hard as they can for the client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nAgent or also citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double merger here and family seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens freight is Tara ... building on on the side of tell just tell tell\nOf course yes and I knew Mr hawk from bowling [noise] 'cause his da da da da da da da da da da da and I knew him from church in\nWhat seems to be amenable to Rio de ... the parents\nOf the family and you can you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\nSo now what does she [noise] coming up at heart gets\nEven harder [noise]\n[noise] Hi expertise from Ireland to Texas radioactive

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nAm Jemma Rogers I'm rubber sill which is radio left and they should get back to our story from producer bena feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right do they do sting but he was a clear it was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and\nKnows what what's their next moves well so they decide to plead guilty plea bargain take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some case yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my clients to\nGet ... into a mental hospital instead of a prison so right away they're going to use this as less rich that was the idea yeah you can you give us a little\nWell that's kinda gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargain thing that's the way for him to get some closure for the family because he can get the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so reporter Jim Tracy again\nThey called a meeting with McCabe investigator from the state police the duct tape and the district attorney armies office and when they met army bell gee search the briefcase was up to be a and the best the gators make sure they weren't wearing bugs\nBecause their parents there's going to be a wiretap or some sort of bug and then a Dell gee presents the deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies I Want you didn't agree to put my client and mental institutions sending them off the president and the prosecutor apparently very quickly\nThe two girls that we're most concerned about we think they're alive and bell Jay said I'm not telling you anything unless we have a deal all the da and the investigator\nThey told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association conference on professional responsibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them layers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love for you\nThat's the hardest part no\nNever dreamed that I don't think I was here or there was a lawyer to do the job [noise] uh [noise] I was a good lawyer [noise] cipher through\nArt everybody um\nAnd now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money Adele gee did a\nJazz body is case taught in law school across the country everybody teachers the case it's like a touchstone what a people thing what if what if what if you will say so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham why don't just\nStand up [noise] um I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you're sitting in on these\nClasses and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n[noise]\nTo from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me\nBut eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing their mind decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and okay\nOkay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm a mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she's camping with her boyfriend and she's who our money in algae found in the mind you know as as I explained before my interest really in the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become um\nSort of wanted to just start with that idea I'm asking something the the new law schools are teaching and and if you had any dealings with all about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nUh 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught as the right way to do things and an ethical class is totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd the the first thing you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes he was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you that I Know that is maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal starting their mind is not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as all happening\nYes and only oh my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing\nWe flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh when we were there sitting with the police men they received the policemen at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's my daughter's boyfriend\nWas his body was found and that's that's all we knew and we never really had any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later and in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli\nA lawyer maybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of\nOf horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\nSo anyway\nStudents there um when they approach that says it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain I think the instinct is to side with the family than to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of like you have a chance to communicate some of that experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later skills I I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because you don't ever go away as long as I Am so\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of 'em that stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you'd want to share I don't know when you don't have to but [noise]\nWell [noise] [noise]\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree pass cheap my slate I we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us and [noise]\nAnd Danny what's your boyfriend had been just that summer and he had a full scholarship Herbert any uh graduated just before and\nSo to live and I'm sure the other two children had great futures had a true and it's just a horrible tragedy\n\nSo horrible you know to be in the position\n[noise] I mean how do you really losing your daughter you know would would accuses for protecting the person that killed her\nNo justification you couldn't just to my mind\nI don't expect [laughter]\nBut that's the way it is [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nUm [noise] I'm gonna get just a minute of silence up here [laughter] that's okay [noise] yeah\n[noise]\n\nI can hear the echoes of dogs come around and things tend to travel up the hill in the dumps around water I think it's\nSome deeper down in there dripping I Can't tell where I'd stripping everything up here it's frozen solid sub sure what that is [noise]\nBut I think I'm going to turn background [noise]\nI Wish I'd put some flowers or something [noise]\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Pullman", "day": "26"}
