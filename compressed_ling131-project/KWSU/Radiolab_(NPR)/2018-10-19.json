[noise]\nAmjad I've I'm Ron I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't [laughter] and uh in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode or contain some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no no no don't say that we have to say that what don't we ask you and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we must that we've done is it on the radio yeah so you got kids with the you may want to make one yeah\nThe story comes to us from producers Simon after so they start can we start in two thousand eight\n[noise]\n\nSo ah December twenty seventh stays sunny Saturday morning or that this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo [noise] and I was singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of [noise]\nYeah [laughter]\nIt was a humble gathering or a a few dozen women and babies that right there are you guys\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering I'm definitely mirrors\nWhat are you calling for surfing\nNurse in areas like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point so Stephanie\nIn this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would apply those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breast feeding isn't exempt period [noise]\n\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that the small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be this morning a face off on Facebook one of the opening\nShot book triggered hordes now what would become a loud but build rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled Facebook the bus today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the strings recently heard about Russian interference in the election meddling or data breaches [noise] but but rather something that I think is a deeper than both [noise] free speech [noise]\nViolence against roe kingdom level of what we can say in what we can't say that again by Tony Little we\nCan see and what we can take the lead Mueller white kids in front of me\nOn the Internet\n\nThey'd prioritized or censors the age where congresswoman or we don't [noise] think about what we're doing a censoring speech but there are types\nOf what what what really grabbed me was [noise] was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual real work\nEight text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook digital document it's about fifty pages if you've printed off\nAnd diet in bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe which made me wonder like what are these rules\nHow were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this world book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back on that morning two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all [laughter]\nIn the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch to just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote than extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employee\n[noise] All right ready so at\nThe time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this is nearly two\nThousand seismic changes this week in the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path my faith is now than a website in the U.S [noise]\nThey spoke somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority at the college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each\nThem in front of their own computer and things would come up onto their screen flagged her face and a leg meaning like I use or saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like her reporting a piece of content that you think violates\nIn those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise] that content along with an alert\nWould would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen most of what you were saying was either\nNaked people blown off heads or things that\nThere was no clear reason why someone had reported because it was like a\nPhoto of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and Everytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at the computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it down\nAnd at the time if you didn't know what to do you turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do at this\nAnd they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't know when you Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that it's one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry that that the guidelines were really one page long there are one long and basically all this page said was nudity is bad so it's Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until [laughter]\nRise up fight for the rights that\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who\nHad organized ironically enough through Facebook so to coincide with the live protest they just through you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse and two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding [noise] and then change their status\nThe title of our group a thinks breastfeeding is not a team [noise] and they caught on social networking website is under fire for any policy on some of them women getting their sheltering twelve thousand members participated and the media frequent started pouring in a bad\nThing is I did hundreds of interviews\nPolls show the Internet is an interesting\nDr phil [noise] it was a media storm and eventually perhaps as a result of our group in our efforts Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules so\nFor example by the end nudity was already not a lot on the site but they had no definition for nudity they just said no nudity and so decided integrity team that those twelve people at the time they they realized they had to start spelling out exactly what they meant\nPrecisely all of these people at Facebook were in charge of trying to define unity\nSo I mean yeah the first cut out it was visible male and female genitalia and then visible female breast and then the question is well okay how much of a breast needs to be showing before it's Newt and the thing that we landed on was if you could see essentially the nipple and Ariel law\nAnd I certainly did you get to work and [laughter] but now I don't have money you know\nYou work in I mean like you just came out of there [laughter] I Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they worked for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like an NDA that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk do you want to be named or do you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that that's the only find you know I just landed history I don't want them\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to ah admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAct or had any ... about ... watch\nBlind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worth of that it couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want\nYou know I I signed up to monitor graphic images\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you guys are so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year could show up to his desk every morning put on his headphones ignored ... we\nCan I just I guess I guess what he's hired ... every day I was just as much as I say she has an edge to edge of which\nFive five thousand a day you just said\nYeah I always like it was a lot of case\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every\nThree or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day oh\n[noise]\nWell ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThe last ... I ... I was ... to ... to ... uh\nYou know get squashed by attack to keep a little cages ... like\n[noise] a\n... year old girl I was having sex with an ... ... it's not just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you did did you\nActually have so they set 'em up at night or he\nCatching some thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax he had to start voting things\nThat were there were specific like I said I couldn't watch it was like okay so ... ... S C I was like okay I got I had to wear exploding like nope I have to walk away and I just have to I I chose to real\n[noise] I I saw that [noise] I it's it's classic adjusted\nUh different moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nYou see all of the stuff that you and I don't have to see\nBecause they're going around playing cleanup yeah what a job well ... and ... and it's worth noting that are more and more this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a door or a terrorist propaganda\nOr that they're getting better automate that they got the uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks\nOf of other terrorists video or other gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda date now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nBut a moving on to our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time\nOr not just automating but even getting their rules straight on\nAnd that surrounding hate speech\nOh good more or less that's coming out of there will be laughter oh really there will be comedians there will be jokes and reviews hey All right okay so we take a break and come right back I think we should\nHi this is Jenny calling from Lima radio lab to support it might transfer why online service that let people send and receive money internationally and therefore the counseling customers holding convert multiple currencies anytime\nMorris transfer wise dot com and [noise] he became Afro American Dina\nI'm getting in community nationwide future at high level and upper ... or whatever broadcaster and found\nLet's let's let's let's let's let's let's\nLet's let's\nLet's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's see [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nThree two one Jed Robert radiolab today we are discussing censorship on Facebook with our producers Simon Adler\nThat thing when do you do for something or did you find them Simon oddly\nSo a couple of months back I think we sent our parents interns\nHide in life is eager to this cramped narrow little comedy club [laughter]\nAnd we sent them there to check out someone else who found a fault line in Facebook's rule book\nSigning hurting it went around the neck pain income that they have it on\nFeel like my first time to the carefree bras\nIn all their friends were like very cool and then you just\nGot dark curly hair was raised in Oklahoma\nJoyce so when you're a Jewish you read about and framed\nYou know a lot of\nThat we'll get back in twenty sixteen\nShe started this political running bit but I think can be called sort of a\nThird is feminist Tacoma [noise] [noise] at first\nI just had this running bet on line\nYou know things like that eventually took\nTo spit on stage even wrote some some\nGuy in mind that [noise]\nMy dad [laughter]\nAnyhow so about a year into this running bit a Marshall logged on to Facebook but uh it instead of seeing her normally feed a there was this message that pops up\nIt said you posted something that discriminated along the lines of race gender or ethnicity group\nAnd so we've removed that post and so I'm like what can I possibly opposed it I really I thought it was like a glitch but\nThen she quick to continue and their highlighted was violating post it was a photo of hers what what is the picture can you describe it\nAs me as well it can only be described as the cherub cute little seven year old with big curly hair and she's wearing a blue floral dress her teeth are all messed up in\nInto the photo Marcia had edited in a speech bubble\nThat just says kill all men and so it's funny you know because I had I had a it's funny you know trust me it whatever so um I posted again immediately after like yeah and it got removed again and this time there were consequences I got banned for three days after that\nThen after several other bam shoot forward this is months later a friend of hers had posted an article in underneath that in the comments section there were guys posting just really nasty stuff\nSo I commented underneath those comments men are Scott which was very quickly removed when how\nHow long did you get banned for this time thirty days wow\nYeah I was dumbfounded [noise]\nSo much a cold on her quote militia exactly to find out like is this just the female comedians who were sort of like mad\nStarted experimenting posting men are scum to see how quickly it would get removed and if it would be removed every time and it was so they started trying other word was yeah to find out where the law and my friend but men are dust that got\nThis is Danny from Denver, Colorado radiolab supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and hunting public understanding of science and technology in the modern world more information about flown at W.

you're just tuning in August episode contains graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we do want you to you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing to do with the kids in that room mate would fit it out okay back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook you've tried to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are stay or had a consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April Fifteen to twenty Thirteen strike\nIran developed by by the way to make it up thank you I mean how can break we have some breaking news uh otherwise I wouldn't cut you off there were abruptly Carlos\nMonday to Fifteen twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure cooker bombs [noise]\nRipped through the crowd was two years the fish fly to Boston [noise]\n[noise] yeah ... ... against the federal\nPeople are spraying into action\nOr just one man get a cowboy hat feeds a spectator who who's been injured picked him up throw them in a wheelchair\nAn ad they're pushing him through that that sort of ash cloud that there's a photographer there any slap this [noise]\nFace is Ashton from all the debris and one of his legs it's completely blown off and the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then started skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific meanwhile\nCBS studio on the other side of the country is fine I remember snippets of the day [noise]\nPlace looking place are clustering around several tasks staring at the computer screens watching the news break\nThis has occurred just in the last half\nHour or so I have memories of of watching some of the coverage shelling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published online\nAnd it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the order that's here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly [noise] going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it just images reading like wildfire across their platform is it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to their rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep\nHowever have to ... says no\nThe other people are saying this is newsworthy\nEssentially they're snowed as being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately receive push back\nWell I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and\nThere are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements\nWe made the guidelines for a moment like this to which the other side shoots back\nOh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines like to have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of the\nStuff in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact\nWords start making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources an executive hundreds ... sent down in order\nWe were essentially told make the exception\n...\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason as the photo stance you're not taking this doubt yes um yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher ... but they don't see maybe they have made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization yeah and this brings up a legal\nQuestion that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like Facebook a sort of collective scrapbook\nFor assault or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want\nOr yeah it is it now a news organization friends' parents they\nLet me let me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher center\nThis is a\nView us as a tech company biggest the primary thing that we do is build technology and found out that you're responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right [noise]\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically soccer brick and others that the company are arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where are they can't be held liable for much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however where were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what ... what really strikes me about all of this is is here you have a company that really\nUh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective as possible and can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask\nWhat people find interesting were important what what people find newsworthy they'll give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this\nOr that happened just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico and it's a a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera\nAnd then a man with his face covered grabs her head pulled her head back and slices her head off right in front of the camera and this video starts being spread\nI Can't count how many times like just reading my Twitter feed I've been like you know like one person who came across this video or at least dozens of others like it was Shannon young my name is Shannon young I Am a freelance radio reporter I've been living here in Mexico for for many years now and\nThere'll be is covering the drug war in doing so years back she noticed this strange phenomena\nIt first caught my attention and early two thousand ten should be checking social media you know
