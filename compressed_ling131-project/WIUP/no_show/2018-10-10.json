obvious thing to say is your full of bologna you [laughter]\nActually ironically the honest with you I was gonna say [laughter] and then I got diverted if there's anyone here who has corner your jokes than I Do it would be used so one of us had to do they do have\nThe looney in belong there special sing try to meet you know things like that so but the thing about alone is has the longest system of Puerto Rico's in the world series every building has a thing in front of it if you could walk on\nIs there a media story to tell before we get to the U.S media stories on\nGlad you asked Ira there is absolutely no means [laughter] except that for years it's been a very left wing city with a left wing press and ruled by in the\nIn the in it yeah the one o'clock in the morning 'cause it's six hours ahead watch the Kavanaugh hearings it was just stunned\nBrings it was it any better in the middle of the night that it was in the morning here trust me it was no no I wouldn't have thought so well we have a variety of things we might talk about before we get to some good news I guess it would be considered good news let's talk about the White House it's hard to avoid Trump White house no matter what we talk about these days\nBut there is a report that until the recent press conference Trump hadn't had a press conference in well over a year there was only one White House press briefing for the entire month of September\nAnd then at the most recent semi press conference that Trump had which he tagged on after the announcement of the trade deal with Canada among other things Trump how shall I say it I'll use the word this but it's probably too light already just two female network reporters\nIt was really something I mean it was really something\nEvery reached a point in this administration where it makes much much of the matter about the fact that there are so few daily press briefings daily of course being an incorrect word\nI Know and for the last shall we started to talk about this topic a little bit and if there is value to the press briefing and the spokespeople for the president has something of value to tell the media then that is useful the problem is that the truth telling from the day is in the press briefing room\nHas been scant there hasn't been a lot of truth telling so I'm not\nSure that there is value in having press briefings everyday now small newspapers particularly benefit from those three things because they may not be able to get access to the top officials\nIn the White House you know I tend to agree with him and what she said last week about you know real reporting isn't done in a press conference when I used to be a reporter\nIn favor of distraction answering reporters' questions it used to be a press conferences were a good way to do that but it's become more spectacle than anything else in in many ways it makes the reporters look bad because\nI hate the spectacle again of reporters shouting questions to president every walks across the White House line it makes us look like a pack of how in theater just counting marinas\nHer high you know the reporters have been largely very much willing to absorb the slings and arrows that are coming from the podium or from the president [noise]\nEvery once in awhile ago Jim Acosta of CNN will speak up and or those the one fellow whose name I don't remember who\nWas involved with playboy magazine as a political reporter I guess the question is is that the appropriate response at this time for the media to just sort of grin and bear it or should we be talking back and when you hear an obvious mistakes\nOr if you were insulted as was just a very good of ABC the other day should they be saying wait a minute that's not correct\nShe said I Believe I beg your pardon early in the door and she took a deep sigh and you know listen let me let me say that\nThings have changed I hear what our to this thing was panelists have said here I think things have changed in that people who are now getting microphones time they are basically becoming stars themselves\nIn by asking the questions that they're asking\nThe alert the American people as to what the story is who you know then it gets like playing handball you know you're going to bounce it against the wall and what you're going to get back but the fact that you're able to ask the question by the way I have proof of this and that is they don't have these briefings anymore\nThey don't have 'em because it's not good for them that's gonna be in their their way of dealing with it when they have something they have to say they'll have a briefing as they did a meeting the White House yes\nWhen you actually looked at the incident where he accused her of not thinking I think it was early and it was hard to understand exactly what she was saying and there was some confusion but his ultimate response was you're not thinking and it was a jab at was beneath president of the United states and so many ways well\nBeneath the president in the United states who says you know grab them whether you know what I mean does it get any worse than that\nHe clearly has a problem with women and that's been well documented but for him to have attacked Cecilia Vegas the way he did even if he misunderstood what she said she said thank you she did not say I'm not thinking and he responded with\nI Know you're not thinking or something to the character assassination and should the group of reporters in the rose garden if that's where I remember it was ...\nShould they have responded and somehow come to her assistance\nI mean this is a professional woman who is clearly capable of handling herself one engaging with the president the United states I think that that was a surprise and it would have taken a person who's on camera live off guard\nWhat do you do in a circumstance that that fact down or say Mr President you misunderstood me or why are you saying that can see is the problem\nDo you think 'cause you're a reporter you've been a reporter tricks you really have let them have it\nI don't know how you do let the president habit but I Do think that there's a problem to take a character assassination and just take it on the costs and say oh well I don't think I would've thought quickly enough to have responded in a way that took the president down but on hindsight we could all say well I don't think\nAgain from my perspective I wanted to get through and actually read the words\nIf you're listening to this program on Sunday night at six get to a TV set at nine thirty on Showtime there is going to be a documentary about this whole story and the process parents ethically one of the producers is a kings to native\nThis is on right after it tonight I thought they had key city I says well\nLet's go to a little bit more pleasant or perhaps hopeful news or perhaps not and that's the increasing reliance and growth of non profit news sites in the light of what is going on in our industry which has been largely negative financially that New York times investigative story not withstanding\nThere is a corner of the Institute for non profit news estimated revenues of between three hundred and twenty five to three hundred and fifty million dollars has been generated by non profit news sites\nAnd that upwards of three thousand people have been employed by the sights twenty two hundred of of whom are journalists and that also comes on the heels of a profit making venture which would be the Philadelphia Inquirer Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nAnd something called the gal and the media group which has announced that they're working together to cover the state Capitol in Pennsylvania pointed exactly\nAbout that cooperation if you remember people doing things that would have been unimaginable before I wanted to ask you a question is somebody who was a publisher and editor\nAnd know the stuff backwards and forwards and that is how bad if the ... in the commercial press in other words we know they're making less money than they did we know they're firing a lot of people when I Want to know and I think all Americans want to know is how much\nHow in danger is the commercial press are they in danger of going out of business in some cases they have but you know right here in Albany we had the all the times union we have other places and you know I Know there's a lot of seeing the blues by these folks but how bad it\nWell the short answer is it's bad I mean how bad it's very bad life in danger rings yes she said yeah I think before you see a number of publications literally go out of business on the inside you're going to see an increase in\nThe publisher let's say you're the publisher of a local paper maybe the times you may be Schenectady pay would you to use the word and you look and you see WAMC for example last year is approaching\nFour million dollars in underwriting on this station you get sick to the stomach these like hey maybe that was the money that used to be mine you get angry\nAs a former publisher and then it's not just WAMC it's all of the other print and broadcast competitors that has sprung up and the last ten or Fifteen Years taking a bite of the pie that we used to control them if you did a pie chart in in my market a relatively small market in the old days when I started in the in the seventies\nYou could look at that pie chart and see the size of a piece of pie but it's pretty much all of it would be daily Freeman advertising revenue and then there would be this one little slice that went to the local radio station\nWell that's slice of the pie is changed dramatically I don't have the most recent numbers but I dare say that the daily newspaper which used to get Ninety percent is now getting less than fifty percent shooting you were the editor of\nSchenectady paper major paper in our area\nCertainly your ear to the ground was grumbling wisdom happiness or the other guys are getting so I think there's always been competition and underwriting at WAMC I Know we call it underwriting it sound like ads to me I Know and that\nWell that means they're not [laughter] but they are they just have some restrictions that that's always been the case or the people that are scooping up or reading most of the pie or Facebook and Google that's really the problem I mean that's the competition and the local market has always been there he just have to make the case\nI think as you get this convergence of media where and newspapers are traditional media offer audio where stations like WAMC offer ... on line\nAnd we get to bring us you can see more of the competition for the local dollars\nI tend to disagree a little bit with Ira about how bad it is for print media and optimistic that these\nHow they spend their money you know I was going to say that but based on what Judy I mean after all they're firing a lot of their borders you know there's still a lot of money coming in through subscriptions and you know I look at this story about the local non profit news sites generating\nThree hundred and twenty five million dollar revenue well as someone who used to run in the gym and saying okay the the ... there's the revenue but what were the expenses you know\nAnd I'm guessing that your experience with the ... which was a privately owned family owned newspaper is different than what most of us now have experience because we've been purchased by corporations were there is more of a\nBottom line mentality I still want to know what's going through the publishers head as they see their profit decreasing\nA lot of getting better five years ago when I was still publishers what was going through my head is I think it's time to retire\nYou know newspapers have happened to get used to the idea that the profit margins weren't what they used to be an weren't what they were in the sixties and seventies when my wedding that's my question Judy what I Do know is when you say you're doing worse how worse is it out the door is oh you'd done what's happening\nBut in the meantime we have these initiatives and innovations that are happening with these not for profits and they are valuable and they lend some content to neighborhoods in cities and towns that might have no content at all yet but if you're the poetry or you're not happy that\nDoesn't make you happy we're at a time I'm unhappy about the Irish Caitlin Judy and Alan thanks for joining us again this week for the Media Project\n[noise] a lot of [noise] you know [noise] I Know that my [noise]\nWelcome to today's program of the commonwealth Columbus California I'm Gloria ... the president and CEO of the club a nonpartisan non profit public forum dedicated to airing desserts\nThey should Pearson story is an episode of public radio program this American Life and it's now been translated to the big screen new motion picture film tells the tale of a man\nPassed during a church of six thousand people to being declared her to

recently invited this American Life host Ira Glass to tell us about Reverend piercing story\nAs well as giving us insight into your life and career of Ira Glass himself he was a conversation with retired judge who doors down [noise]\nGood evening and welcome everyone to tonight's program at the commonwealth club California my name is ... Cordell retired superior court judge and and I'm delighted really delighted to be your moderator for tonight's program joining us tonight is Ira Glass a titan of public radio [noise]\nIra's show this American Life has over two million listeners every week\nAnd IRAs new role as being producer of the Netflix film come Sunday were excited that I was here tonight to discuss the film and the journey this real life story it's taken since he first reported it over a decade ago the ladies and gentlemen please join me in welcoming Ira Glass to the commonwealth club [noise]\n\nIra I'm very excited about our conversation I'd like to do three things tonight I'd like to talk a little bit about this American Life than about the film come Sunday and then I find so fast and\n[laughter] so this American\nLife was created in Nineteen Ninety five yes and I believe you're up to six hundred thirty something episodes yeah ... like that um and that wasn't the original name of the program right\nYeah I Know the original name was your radio play house and I just thought like it's sort of the call back to to like sort of radio drama radio play house and then also it was going to shut up to ... play house\nOh yeah I'm In his pre masturbation in public [noise] which\nHonestly is any way you see us and then uh and then we changed the name we we change the name partly because the program director in Los Angeles that you like before we even we're trying to distribute the show she heard a copy of the show just somebody showed quit or a tape of it\nIt's just like we want to run this we know you're not being offering it nationally but we want to run now but you have to change the name because we already have a show called NPR play house and and and then she suggested that we call it she's like I've got an idea should be called a glass house\nAnd I was like I don't want to show with my name and the title a counter propose glass whole\n[noise] and she said no to that [laughter]\nPartly because when the screenwriter was talking to ... it was a story that had meant a lot to him and tested his faith because once he's saying you don't go to hell he really had to deal with like well what about all these people who you think are centers should they stopped singing and then he had to examine did he really think that was a sin\nAnd then also he had kind of a business problem which was he didn't have anybody to preach to and so maybe these people have been rejected by the church he preached to them\nAnd somehow like those things are kind of came together in an interesting way to talk about you a little bit you're in charge I\nLove it [noise] so\nYour dad's an accountant yes your mom a psychologist yes and the New York times had a special epidemic for your mother you know what I'm Talking about ... about her research the godmother of infidelity research yes [noise]\nThat she would say not based on personal experience [laughter] [noise] like to say that yes\nShe uh she when she was getting her PHD at Catholic university in uh in psychology she uh she started researching people's affairs by giving them questionnaires\nWere they happy in their marriages when the ... one of her most interesting findings was that she was seeing a rise in the number of people who had happy marriages but they still cheated and and she attributed it went to these a lot of people who were in a practice and she did studies on this\nAnd a lot of it was um that are more men and women are working together with peers and so they're spending hours together and they would just fall in love with people and um and and and so and people would say to her like I don't I never saw myself with somebody who would cheat like I'm happily married\nLike they weren't unhappy with their marriages um but then I kind of fell for this other person two of them are together all day and this and that\nAnd I'm In a letter to a whole theory about what to do to help marriage is not make that happen how to make marriages recover\nWhen that does happen or you know one of the things that that was an innovation is that up until that time if you if you had a marriage and was falling apart and you went to\nA marriage therapist and they you said we want to stay together the the thing that they would interrogate you about is is uh if you cheated if somebody cheated there'll be like well what's wrong with your marriage\nAnd you're totally focused on that my mom said like will actually for over thirty these marriages it's actually not direct question they're happy define there's nothing wrong with their marriage marriages actually fine\nIf you focus on that question you actually missing the thing that's really the thing you need to treat which is the trial\nThat somebody is lying to somebody you see that had a public school the Baltimore yeah then you go to brown via northwestern yeah I went to northwestern for two years in the ... the brown and then you majored in something called sent me on it ... I looked it up I don't know what it is [noise] semi had access\nTo this kind of body of a French a narrative theory literary theory narrative there are like the part that I studied was about like what's with semi addicts is it's it's it's the theory of science and we'd go to it's like how does meaning generated by different things but the part of it that that's\nFrom a bar and and people like that in contrast to like the way that like traditional literally three goes where if you remember like in high school it's like what the themes of when you're studying a piece of work a film or a book\nIt's about like what did the themes of it you know what does it say about the author what'd you say about the authors time there's a question just semantics has no interest in that at all what's in the audience is interested in is how does this film or a book or whatever\nHow does it for you when how does it sink it's how does it like get into you so you want to turn the page and stay for the next minute and the next minute like what is the machinery of it and and and it's coming out of his officers like has quite a few questions and has answers to like\nAt the end of a really great move your episode of TV or or a film like you know that feeling where you just for like ... and then other times I feel like they're like well what happened\nIn the one where you feel like ... ... ... what's the machinery of the story that makes it happened so that's what I studied in school and immediately started to try to put it to use in the stories I was making for the radio and a lot of the structure of the stories in the way I think about the stories\nComes from that theory oh you are Jewish and you are atheist yes how's that work [noise] but you can't get rid of being a Jew\nIdea [laughter] you know like this [noise] I think [noise] is it Richard Rodriguez says like your your like your ethnicity isn't like a suitcase you can lose at the airport you know like I guess sort of stuck with it and uh but I don't believe in God so you know but like my sisters and I we had to like find\nJewish Hebrew school education edition or public education go three times a week and all through the ninth or tenth grade so tell me about rabbi she more as I said he had an influence and you're creating this American Life I mean there are a bunch of things I mean a rabbi ... ... it's I I it's funny it's only in retrospect\nThat I that I realized like oh yeah uh but but rabbi ... um\nThe ... the structure of the stories that we tell on this\nAnother anecdote and then another thought so I sort of came to a conclusion that that's a good way to make radio stories and it's good at this joy sort of funny at the beginning and kind of sad at the end and when I was growing up there were two things in my life that did that and one war Broadway musicals totally or have them sort of like\nFunny at the beginning sat at the end of like a musical like good we're on the roof you know like and and pull you went with the characters and then like sort of drive at these bigger ideas about bigger things but the other was was was the sermons\nThat like this rabbit after I was really entertaining speaker so entertaining I remember even as a child looking forward to the sermon and you know like the Jews like the Sherman can last for like forty five minutes you know like it's not like a ten minute homily or something like whenever I go to like mass I'm just shocked at like weight\nThat's it that's all you got to say they warmed up you know what I mean like but like you know like like it would be like a forty\nFive minute talk often you know and like\nThen start a super funny and somebody had seen on television and he's talked about reminded of course bringing back to a pastor in the Bible and whatever the patches that week and then in each sort of\nAn ... the structure of the radio show is exactly the structure of a sermon and once I start to make stories like that like I I I I don't know I ended up ... this is my ... so attracted to this warm hostile remember being and show\nThinking to myself that guy's got the job [laughter]\nHow'd you get up there once a week tell a story tell a story do your thing [laughter] here's a really good at his job is very moving you really had a way of like\nBringing it around as something really moving at the end which is hard when you're working with the Bible because the stories are so like don't you find the Bible stirs or so like weirdly unsatisfying\nLike a very scary and you know I'm not happy ending\nTo me is like what happened these all voted I like when did he change like what's his art makes no sense like if you leave out like what were the transformational things that turn them from the God of wrath\nOf the Old Testament who like telling Abraham to take his kid up on the mountain just kill your kid to prevent much alike may end like like the\nBook of ... what what kind of two points\n[noise] but by the New Testament like it's just like it seems like he's really done some thinking [laughter] I said with respect I said with respect like [laughter]\nI'm just saying [laughter] it's a confusing book and made proper explanation so what is it\nAbout public radio he started when you were in Nineteen yeah why what's the draw for you but when I was Nineteen it wasn't like I had anything else to\nDo like that was the place that I could talk my way into an internship fats with the attraction them at All right okay\nAnd I had never heard of NPR when I started working there it was just like I had a list of places to go and I was like a well nobody had it was Nineteen Seventy eight NPR and we started in Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd so like it was tiny like they didn't have a satellite yet and so to Europe like all things considered on cake you eat the literally within ... through a phone line like like in ... yeah I was like before and they don't have a satellite to Nineteen eighty there was so small I can if you would hear all things considered and kick you do it would be like somebody had taken the phone in Washington\nAnd held it up to the radio [laughter] we were hearing it through their phone\nThat's what it sounded like and so it was always very very early days like training and so you could talk I just talk my way into an internship at the time it was used for his office building on every street you are a talker I mean I Am tired yeah I Am a talker\nAnd so so and then and then like better because it was a small to very young age by the time\nGo back to college I took a type of college to work at all things considered and I very much didn't want to go back\nI felt like I was doing stories every day and you know producing things and it was going on the radio to a million people which was the audience voting sort of the time but that's a lot of people and my parents there was one of the two times in my life with my parents just like they pulled this move that is so smart\nWhere they said um where they very much wanted me to go back to college\nAnd they said this move where they said um don't do it for I don't do it for yourself don't do it because you think it's a good idea to do it for us\n\nYou may not be that there were no no no no no no no\nNo no the\nThe people around here too that they ... they latch on then men very dry cat ...\nDo well on the ground right yeah yeah and\nShe has no\n\nStraight down here or there was a\nKid that was the last thing you\nKnow we were around a little\nBit or you know\nI guess we better no she said to blow up a jury in

[laughter] so\n\n[laughter] oh and I do and five [laughter] yeah so uh yeah it's a running back at that like the main thing 'cause like\nI see the issue of being the way they ... they play calling like Doug Peterson really good play color he ... he does what he he had to change what he done but he doesn't like to run the ball and\nYou kind of put everything on Carson wants to do what he did last year and put the numbers but the line at the holding enough and\nHe's not he I don't think he's ... and be in that store again\nStill like without the running game it's going to hurt them at ... ... dollars a year now that it was a big way Seattle oh heck no [laughter] we're not going down that road hey we're going to a Super Bowl and of\nCourse\nYeah but it's like the same thing as the patriots dare not comfortable until October is they always start bad and then they that's true I I still think we're going a little run at some point here but it has to start being the giants tomorrow definitely\nThink after Monday's game the Redskins have any confidence in your division I I honestly think eagles the only ones that can actually win the division I don't think that I may be true\nThe end of the playoffs\nThat's true or adults that have been a nightmare [laughter]\nHuh so staying in the division will move onto the cowboys who lost it off the Houston the up after that controversial for the one that they punted is that right in the valley and all the time ... so\nYeah obviously but a ... is do you think he's on the hot seat or do you think he's fine first of the year\nI Would put them on the hot seat but I mean Jerry Jones stayed loyal to him through a lot a lot of bad stuff so I was\n\nJust getting a little more yeah [laughter]\nYeah\nAnd the grass don't get any easier they have Jacksonville this week so yeah\nYeah but they love it ended already there and I've been pretty short\nDoubts would be way easier and then ... what Kansas City didn't do because dollars more one sided now just run on the ball like they have no uh receivers now should they have should ever caught does what industry kept\nThem I think what does it was just character issues they just didn't do well in the locker room so I get that you know I mean but I mean sometimes talent as more paramount than anything else\nThat forget Jay probably written off though [laughter] oh yeah well you know under\nHis hired illegals jumped in front of him to take Dallas a skirt tighten okay you're actually can think he did really well oh yeah I'm so we all great like Michael we said Redskins are out like you don't think they have\nA chance you see the Monday Night that was ...\nI don't know if that saves the coach's job you can get fired last year I don't know\nBut he was he was on and said we play horrible ambushed fire everybody with me starting so [laughter] ownership should be like yeah you know what are you writing fire\n\nAnd it made it may well yeah yeah and brood and yeah I was gonna say maybe censors Gurdon sibling earlier in the last time\nYeah so yeah I mean they may have two dozen seven was weird year with the Jacksonville beating the Steelers and the play offs and then they may have they may have been\nThey beat the sailors in like the wild card yep and then the left very likely that they always want a couple of years I think that was the year like the charges up to the championship game yeah like I was a weird year has run the tractors actually\nNot far or what's your thoughts well okay I said last week that the rate of Scotland division a\nI regret that now I have an eye on a actually cut but there are I mean they're still every team and they have the north is good enough to win the division this the first time that's happened maybe ever\nOn us and that is true um we had for rookie quarterback play for them all the all one which which rookies advised impressed you got the most\nGood question good question uh\nI'm not I don't know about Baker yet because she beat the rate ravens on feel like they have that much of a\n... point yeah isn't so much focus on not necessarily rookies but first year starters guys like my homes that yeah they're almost overshadowing the rookie quarterbacks you know they know what I'm saying is Alan's wins or medicine for instance because no one expects them the way that I very true yeah\nNo one I haven't like watched most on him to like he's on the cardinals and they're so unreliable\nAlan's on the bills Rosen's on the ... yeah I mean I used\nTo I've done like I've done I've done that before to my right you can you can't get any of those games in this market anyway on Danny so actually I Can't watch ... D yup Sunday ticket I Wonder how the bills beat the planes with Conan\nThose are just been weird the bills blew out the Vikings and then were shut out by Green Bay so both teams that beat the eagles yeah well they're just now [laughter]\nThe bill the bells [laughter] those are just going to do what they want to do and they'll end up six and ten and third and the AFC uh after you\nKnow just go they're going to get like a top five ... most likely because they're not going to be that bad\nWe thought Miami was going to the hospital do yeah but what how was how bad they look to doing on their New England to an individual\nTo say anything else is only just to just giving yourself also of good things happening and you never know there's a big Zachary it's just you're just you just got accepted at this point that as long as ... as long as ... they're they're just going to win the division [laughter]\nThey they are yeah I thought that was a nice thing hey Miami's undefeated airplane the patriots if they make no doubt that we're moving on to Cincinnati exactly moving on to Cincinnati\nHe says now we're on to Kansas City on can you say day down the yellow brick road and all\n[laughter] [laughter]\nWhere else on [laughter]\nPretty much like ... the defense is good\nFor that every stays healthy he's good he's already out Jackson will not in Jacksonville just dead that's right see if anything that I think a little while so he's absolutely wash died on that he might they might be able to milk and other three quarters of a season or out of them that is true you never know\n\nYeah I feel like it's yeah you haven't done it yeah he hasn't had a very good seasons that division we're going to do that every year and the NFL ...\nBy by like week Thirteen will be like oh everything's normal again stewards are on top and a new England's on top and all this stuff saints win and everything like silly ... yeah you're on TALK\nI think\nCleveland will probably still be doomed to finishing last night vision but instead owe and sixteen it'll probably be\nPretty good but it's like a surprise us and yeah for that now they are probably ten wins the Steelers maybe eleven or ten and the time I don't know\nYeah it all depends on how many more any last thoughts for you go to break a quick\nUh the whole green may say no more Aaron Rodgers or E. L. A. lax right now more of that in Green Bay that game I mean would you may have grown now do you measure it all ... but I told you had some bad on\nYour knees and getting old\nYeah gray hair you know if\n\nThat's true but Mason Crosby haven't been a legend like guys like Venice area can kick into\nFor a long\nYeah he's been serviceable but I think I think he's better so do you think Pakistan the chance to do something with Aaron Rodgers you always have a chance to watch to see what happens\nHe bashes that often so much [laughter] receivers I yeah I ... I Wonder why you like to practice if you're just yelling at them I never know probably that's crazy I don't think there's got it\nYeah down there or at least that's a good trip escape you can play like you did when he threw six touched them again like that but if they can do is have you can get half of that every week there'll be fine\nBut over the short break we'll come back with and and that's and then we'll be right here on both of us live on Ninety point one ...\n\nChances are you or someone you know has age related macular degeneration or AMD millions of people who are losing their site a empty and I'm One of them getting that diagnosis\nBlindness at one eight hundred six three two two zero zero five for free kid about preventing it managing the disease that's one eight hundred six three two two zero zero five\n\nEvery single one of his medical bills and everything is just all taken care of a phenomenal research are standing clinical care and the generosity of public which allows to treat patients regardless of what type [noise]\nAt Saint Jude families never received a bill for treatment travel housing or food because the only thing that family should worry about\nHas a new [noise] it is safe and\nSix months from now I'm going to be a\nSoldier is one thing I Want to change about me right now\nI've tried before but\nThis time I'll do it for me and the baby\nMost people don't succeed at first it often takes several tries the important thing is to never quit on yourself visit quit or a new dot org or call one eight hundred lung usa for tools in tips from the American lung association we support the quarter in you\nOkay we're back was what ... we're just not done talking some uh NFL well now move on to some will be which the first round has really focused on ended right\nLike yeah to visit divisional series lizard Lauren everybody has [noise] you know everyone they were winning I was actually going for the Yankees this year and that was that ninth ending last night with the heartbreak ... they got the tying run like ... and couldn't get anything done against ...\nAnd then we have a Boston Red Sox taken on a ... you know and then we have brewers taken on Dodgers\nI mean those all the Yankees at least you thought for ...\nAlthough I don't I'm not I don't know that I have a favorite stand\nOr the only one of these teams I ever had of is the red Sox maybe I'll just root for them and wherever Red Sox I think that was the only\nI think the red Sox Yankees was only like series so far that actually interesting\nDid yeah I mean the only um there were only there were only two wins and all of the division series by the losing team the Braves got one game in game three and then the Yankees won game too so they're going to lead the Dodgers and asked robes again ah the red Sox in Milwaukee are both really good team yeah they're going to Milwaukee I had doubts about but they just kick\nThe crap out of your auto weapons there was a lot of ah extra inning game so far as the postseason yeah some good economic games good nice exciting games\nLike yeah 'cause the cargo and rocky that yeah that was extra and they all seem to be too bad for both of them than either one of them yeah postseason anymore so um the last one for Colorado that they got this year\nFun while you're on your logo is Ben Franklin for basketball I never I don't know why I never picked up on that never I never ...

I don't think that I work in the ... yeah I don't think I don't think they do more harm not ... yeah 'cause I don't I mean they are they've tried it they haven't tried it since like seventies or eighties or whatever navy a but it's you never know\nI don't know how much the Panthers get I don't know how much their games get for them\nYeah I don't know how long it a whole lot I mean obviously I have more people for the NBA but they yeah they should try it habits if the NBA is like yeah we're going to go to Seattle and then we're looking for a team in the east to a season ticket Dr Sam and here we don't get like the Golden Knights\nThat then yeah you know hockey town yeah there there was a marketing Vegas for that and they're getting the raiders to they could get a major league baseball team\nTo use ... for the fifty ones if they want to be\n\nBut wouldn't that be true as well now Cleveland, Ohio that's well they don't have the Washington Wizards are basically Baltimore yeah thing but [noise] yeah\nYeah it's just a matter where it would it's less about the city and I think well obviously it's about city if you're going to sell tickets but if they already have an arena or plans to build the radio because that's a big thing\nPittsburgh's got PG paints arena but I don't know if that I don't know if that can handle hockey and basketball honestly not sure who are held yeah I'm not ashamed hearts man is but that's yeah everyone at every couple of years the March Madness there\nAnd I'm like no\nThat's true but I don't have a good place yeah that wouldn't be bad either eddy\nThey go for it yeah yeah well that's a hoot\n\nYeah they they might they ... yeah the last year for like a throwback game\nYeah so you couldn't do it in Kansas City then yeah they'd have to do something else I guess you're right yeah huh\nMay maybe do a thing like um where you had the browns become the ravens and then you just made a new Brown's ... just had to move the thunder back to the sonics and then just have a new thunder\nLet's for nobody cares about the Oklahoma City thunder I feel like they have\nThey lost everybody that they had ever except Westbrook yeah so\nYeah the ... and an apple\nYourself as a casual basketball fan of this the first time I've heard the name Denis shorter my lifestyle obviously is not the guy\nThat don't don't say that doesn't doesn't help\nThe kids [laughter] case but obviously more than casual fans\nYeah well we do the name of the uh Schroeder will we get in there and uh get annoyed by a loose the like in peanuts\n[laughter] uh never a bad time to make a Snoopy reference\n\nWho's dude with the heat that had the ...

at just these two years of the U.S [noise] we've got one point three billion and the UN but we made a stronger we made it more efficient [noise]\nSouth Sudan we got an arms embargo which was a long time coming freed North Korean sanctions packages which we're the largest and generation done in a way that we could really work\nOn the Iran deal bringing attention to the world that every country needs to understand you can't overlook fall of the bad things they're doing do you have to see them for the threat that they are um I think you will get the anti Israel bias and the strike\nEncouraged that the president showed in moving the embassy and showing the rest of the world we put our embassy where we want to put our and\nDuring Nikki Haley's time as US ambassador to the United nations the United states withdrew from the Paris climate accord the un human rights council the Iran nuclear deal on we're on the un agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinians and UNESCO\nThe un educational cultural agency the Trump Administration also threatened to sanction judges on the international criminal court if it went after Israel or the United states for war crimes\nAnd the U.S refused to sign the global compact on migration a set of non binding rules for safe orderly and regular migration while Nikki Haley did not say why she was resigning she dismissed speculation she'll be running for president in twenty twenty\nPresident Trump says he'll name a replacement in the coming weeks on Tuesday is that his daughter Ivanka Trump would be incredible at the job as long as the Trump later tweeted that she would not be replacing Haley uh the person who does replace your will have to go before a Senate confirmation\nDonald Trump also said one possible candidate is dean\nBe close to the precedent as well as his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner\nWallet the White House power focused in part on us relations with Israel and Saudi Arabia she attended President Trump's first meeting with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia um had been some on NBC reports she was also involved with overseeing a two hundred billion dollar arms deal between the U.S and Saudi Arabia\nTo talk about the significance of Nikki Haley's departure and the role of the United states at the United nations we're joined now by Rashid Khalidi the Edward Said professor of Arab studies at Columbia University author of several books his most recent brokers of deceit how the U.S has undermined peace in the middle east his next book\nTitled the Hundred Years' war on Palestine will be out and may professor welcome back to democracy\nNow like you and your first response was a shock to you like to so many others\nThat was a surprise because she put such a a a nice face an articulate face\nOn a policy that is terrific in many respects [noise] um ... Iran on so many on so many fronts um what she was putting forward while perhaps red meat to the president's base is probably aboard the most Americans and has contrary to what she said\nThey'd be like so it's much more isolated internationally\nIt's also interesting that timing or maybe she just said I mean they were saying that it didn't they didn't want to look like after the midterm elections but they say that last week the resignation letter was put in\nWhich was right after I'm a\nJudge Kavanaugh at the time testified during the FBI I suppose that investigation so to say the least there was a lot of tension within the Trump Administration around us um and she didn't say anything about this at the time but of course if she ran in the future she could refer\nThe allegations by women should ... should be heard and to be investigated so she's a very ambitious woman if she's planning Iran should Trump not run again in twenty twenty or twenty twenty four this sets up perfectly I mean it it fits perfectly that the the ambitious calculating nature that she was already shown at the un and in South Carolina\nI wanted to go back to um why Nikki Haley said sitting next to President Trump and the White House um about her relationship with both Trump's daughter Ivanka and son in law Jared Kushner\nDuring the news conference she's single then out for praise\nJared is such a\nGenius that no one understands to redo the NAFTA deal the way I'm what I've done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so unbelievably well done an office and just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the scenes\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're a better country because they're in the administration\nThat was Nikki Haley again speaking in the oval office next to President Trump talking about Jared Kushner um this is your expert teacher a Palestinian American professor or the Edwards said professor at\nColumbia University um talk about Jared Kushner and what she described as is remarkable are incredible role in uh in dealing with the middle east\nWhat you would only consider remarkable if you think that denying that the Palestinians have a role the Bosnian refugees should return or have any rights that under what is a good thing that Jerusalem is the capital and should be a capital for Palestine [noise] um the policies that she has put forth\n... says this is leading them down the path\nA to a situation where no compromise is possible where Israel become of the solar everything\nUm and Trump seems to be very content with those are the Palestinians are should accept whatever places offered to them in this process and that is what does what Christian or has been doing\nSystematically on Jerusalem on refugees on the idea of a Palestinian state um they have dismantled all all the elements of what I've always considered a very bad American policy has become much worse of science to her so Jared Kushner is a genius\nIf you believe that Israel is one can impose any terms at once on the Palestinians who should not have sovereignty self determination or said what if you believe that and it's a wonderful balls\nOn may fourteen the Israeli military massacred at least sixty one unarmed Palestinians are wounded and this one day twenty seven hundred more for protesting in Gaza against the Israeli occupation in the opening of the new U.S embassy in Jerusalem\nAt the United nations US ambassador Nikki Haley block to call for an international investigation into Israel's actions\nI asked my colleagues here in the Security Council who among us would accept this type of activity on your border no one with no country in this chamber would act with more restraint than Israel has\nSince March thirty at the beginning of the right of return campaign protests on Israeli soldiers and snipers have killed at least on an area of one hundred Ninety five Palestinians wounded more than Eighteen thousand your comments on what she performed at the United nation\nNo country on earth\nThat shot thousands of people\nOn the other side of its border\nWould be would be free of condemnation in the United nations imagine if the United states shot down hundreds of Mexicans killed two hundred and ... wounded or maimed thousands across the border inside Mexico\nIn the sovereign territory of another country it would be completely unacceptable the Palestinians clearly don't have rights they can be the victim can be vilified by people like Nikki Haley but it's it's revolting\nOf the very the very the very description of the Palestinians as the aggressors and the Israelis as a victim Israeli snipers are targeting these people one by one\nAnd the Israelis are being defended by Nikki Haley at the United nations\nJust before the U.N General assembly denounced Washington's decision to move its end that scene Israel to Jerusalem\nA new U.S ambassador Haley tweeted a warning to other nations she wrote quote\nAt the un were always has to do more and more so when we make a decision that the will of the American people about where to locate are and say we don't expect that at least we helped to target us on Thursday there'll be a vote criticizing our choice to us we'll be taking names the ambassador famously said professor have\nI mean this is the most vibrant expression of American exceptionalism I've I've ever heard um United States is not bound by laws the United states is not bound by conventions United States does exactly as it pleases the issue of Jerusalem is a\nComplicated legal issue but it's not that complicated everything United States has done his credit uh seven decades or inside a little more of international\nConsensus uh as far as the treatment of Jerusalem and they don't care of the United states under Trump at the United states has always done more or less pleased but at least it paid lip service to to to law and international legitimacy not under this administration\nMore than that the fact that they did whatever they have done to him and hug gee so blatantly indicates they're trying to send a message don't you dare talk about what we're doing\nAnd the Trump Administration responding think Mattis who speaks with his study counterparts often when asked by a journalist who were monitoring the situation closely when pressed the Pentagon is monitoring he said we're doing so intellectually right\nRight and of course President Trump and Jared Kushner's very close relationship to not ... factor ruler in Saudi Arabia\nYeah I think that the Saturdays must've calculated the bin Laden and his father the king must have calculated the king had anything to do with it must have calculated that they're going to get a pass from Washington\nThat the contracts are too important that the alliance is too important that the billions of dollars that the United states gets out of arms and planes and ... and other things inside the Arabian banking oil obviously is much more important to Washington than some dissident who was disappeared and stumble\nUm or the hundreds of thousands of Yemenis who are dying of diseases like cholera that are completely treatable because of the siege are imposed by the side of ... and ... and their allies in Yemen are these things are obviously unimportant in Washington one would wish that are super ... senators and our sue pine numbers of the house of representatives\nWere represent we'd get up on her hind legs they could actually affect us that the Trump Administration will but they could and this is ... is this is getting more and more of a region I don't know how much longer um people are going to be able to stand the stench of this kind of absolute monarchy\nOr imposing itself in stamping out all kinds of basic freedoms while offering you know ... basically token reforms it's wonderful that women can drive\nThere'll be great if women could open their mouths is wonderful\nTo the point of view that's freedom um and that's what's being denied to the ... and what Saudi Arabia and its allies are or doing all over the region in every country in which they're exerting influence they're not working for democracy there working against democracy against constitutions against represent to go\nAnd they're working with the United states for example in Yemen\nAnd in love with him as a target and you\nKnow it's it's as refueling and you know what it is in his hand in glove and everything they do maybe not in the disappearance of the United states has been since I think thirty three longest relationship in it because in the middle east\nBefore Israel was even before turkey joined they'd do it and said you it'd be a war like this very very close\nRelationship that's not really changed one bit so\nWell I Want to thank your shade holiday Edward ... professor of Arab studies at Columbia University the author of a number ... most recent brokers of deceit how the U.S has undermined peace in the middle east his next book the Hundred Years' war on Palestine will be out in may that democracy now when we come back we had to Minnesota\nTo the vowels Turner's will join us

Turner's Annette clap Stein and Emily Johnston along the support person Benjamin ... are part of the group climate direct action\nThe activist mounted a coordinated campaign on October eleventh two thousand sixteen and which they cut chains and turn the manual safety valves to stop the flow of oil through the Enbridge energy pipelines and four location this is ...\nCalling and bridge from the valve site to warn them of the action\n\nJohn than in a club team going reminder in Minnesota ...\nIn the early ... seven hundred miles from the ... and ... says\nTo ensure future human civilization\nRemote immediately ... burning of duty in Tarzan proceeds\nGoing through the ... you don't want to hang up the phone and we're going to do and we shut down the ... going on our\nReceiver your term\nThat was ... in a clip from the film without turning\nIn Washington state three other defendants who took part in the effort have lost their cases and face short sentences community service mandates and deferred imprisonment the Minnesota case was the first and only of the four valves Turner cases where a judge allowed the defendants\nTo use the necessity defense the activists say their decision to break the law was necessitate by the clear and present danger posed by climate change later the judge ruled expert witnesses including three fifty dead or founder Bill McKibben and former top NASA climate scientist James Hansen would not be allowed to testify on their behalf\nThis this defendant Emily Johnston speaking after her acquittal Tuesday\nI'm very relieved to sit in Minnesota acknowledge that we can do damage and no damage [noise] ah I also admit that I Am disappointed that we did not get to put on trial that we hope that we very much wanted everyone to be able to use it for the jurors to be able to hear from our expert witnesses uh we did this action\nTo almost two years ago to the day on Thursday will be a second anniversary\nBecause the problem of climate change is so urgent that we have to start shutting does her since ... down now\nThe trial came just as the United nations climate panel warned in a landmark report that humanity is only a dozen years to mitigate climate change your face global catastrophe\nFor more we go to Minneapolis where we are joined by valve Turner's and clap Stein and Emily Johnston as well as Dr James Hansen the former top climate scientist at NASA now the director of climate science awareness and solutions at Columbia University's Earth Institute\nAnd with us Kelsey ... one of the attorneys representing the valve Turner's in their necessity defense she's also executive director of the climate defense project we welcome you all to democracy now let's begin with a valve Turner's 'em yourselves Emily and Annette Emily begin by talking about the ...\n[noise] um ... so we entered a we broke the links that to a couple of chains uh\nEnter enter into the enclosures where the pipelines a\nYou were with their valves or we began to shut off line one is on the south but we had made to the calls in advance so that I find companies could shut them down or mostly if they if they just chose to and we knew that that was actually standard procedure 'em and they did in fact started doing that shortly thereafter\nAnd Emily John ... and ... rather and clap Stein why did you decide to do this\nOr we decided to do this because tar sands are the dirtiest and ah most climates polluting spoils as there is\nUm and as Dr Hanson has said you know it's game over for the climate of these are developed so we wanted to shut them down um because they absolutely\nHave to be shut down if we do have a chance of having our children and future generations have a habitable planet\nAnd you talk about your role as a retired attorney and arranging granny on who do you represent\nWho do I represent no accident attorney\nOh I was staff attorney for the pure all up and then try for Twenty one years I retired in two thousand five\nAnd did some of your work there and forum and what you did hear\nYes to some extent um I mostly worked on fisheries issues and fisheries are the absolute you know heart of the spiritual cultural and economic life of the Pacific northwest tribes and um the salmon\nAnd\nSitting on me that earthquake and tsunami that Lee signing ... island ... Hara where it looks like five thousand people are missing Seventeen hundred confirmed dead any link there um it's not the earthquake the power of the ...\nWell a there's a link in terms of the impact of the tsunami their recent papers on this that show that\nSea level is rising and when you add the human caused increase in sea level to the ah Saddam me it makes it a more damaging that has been actually a a parrot\nOn a recent uh hurricanes hitting the United states the sea level global average sea level has gone up about ... centimeters big cause of greenhouse warming which is about eight inches but along the coast uh eastern coast of the United states it's about twice as much\nAnd when you add that to a sea level rise to the storm surges it makes them that much worse and of course the warming also increases the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere increases the rainfall totals\nAnd so uh the uh global warming effect it has been making\nHurricane affects significantly larger\nThere's also a a recent paper by James uh costs and which argues that\nThe speed the translation speed of these storms in many cases has been slowed down and that in the case of the Houston and the Carolinas a hurricane's they moved slowly and so the ...\nIn general and be related to global warming\nEmily Johnston a you cofounded three fifty dead Oregon Seattle, Washington I'm as we wrap up ... your thoughts on what your plans are now that you are acquitted\nA well in the immediate sense you know we are engaged in a in many climate campaigns in Seattle and in Washington state uh there's plenty of work to be done not looking forward to getting back to it great majority of that work is legal um but we do engage in some civil disobedience actions are and\nYou know we really with this trial we particularly wanted a ... to do than Saturday defense this would've been sort of a dream trial in terms of our expert witnesses or and our ability to present that defense the fact that we couldn't do that is is pretty heartbreaking um and so I Know a lot of people are still thinking about\nWho you're going to how can any working out there but we'll do part to impose sideline at democracy now to Oregon at cop standing and Emily Johnston Kelsey Skaggs and Dr ... thanks so much I'll be speaking in Florida next weekend as well as Washington thanks for joining [noise]\nThis is Ninety ...
