I got my eyes on he loved to die\nWe giants daddy daddy\nI think I can\nReally relate to check\nOn my dad's ... Johnny ...\nKnow\nI ... in the studio right it's a first local limelight premier you glad to have a lot of times we have recurring guess\nLike the same old folks the same old open Mike folks come through all the time and works I have you here because you are represented to meet the new breath of life has been briefed into open Mike ... and the ... what what what are you thinking of opening like do you have any favorites any any people you love to see that\nI'm a long long time is that like the box and nice and\nYou know a good friend very good at what he does you know yeah you definitely\nAnd it's like yeah now do you mostly performing right as a soloist or do you ever have you ever worked with other\nI mean I had like a band in high school we just did Congress stuff and I'm working on trying to find more people to play like together but it's hard to find people are more interested in like how I Am too so\nBetter like getting there seems like everybody's complains like they and they ... at\nThe same thing like he was trying to get a band together but it's tough because one it's fun and the people like you said who are interested in the same things yeah\nToo I mean even if the intent is they're being able to follow through and I usually do it it's so hard\nYeah and and being on the same page and I found in high school like I had a band practice rape but then at the time we just did it like random stuff and wouldn't actually practice hiding anyways and it's great\nFor me it's like hot enough to get a friend to go to like get him to have our schedules aligned just to get dinner let alone ... trying to get someone to bring a drum set right yeah yeah and that's another\nIssue has this stuff because I knew my house we used everything the drum set and keyboard and tons of ... and stuff but like it's hard like my drummer can bring the Trump so yeah\nI so we we've identified the Fort problems ... one ... one\nFind people who are interested that's tough to find people who can actually do it yeah [laughter] that theory find a way to get all your stuff to the place and for as a three part B [laughter] find a place where you can put all this stuff that's that's oftentimes the hardest question like\nI get I live on campus yeah in a drunk [laughter]\nBut I find that there's there's hidden spots around campus it's taken me until my fourth year to recognize that the music building a in large part is open to\nMost students I mean I go in there all the time just to play they have like upright pianos and the practice rooms not very in tune or anything but I mean the Steinway piano just like children that I like what I can use these at least once a week\nThe thing I did I was like yeah I I don't I never owned a piano or anything but I had learned records and I was like oh man I'll get to use my ...\nYeah yeah I was like these are paddles with says these these [laughter] and then when I first started\nLike when I got here I couldn't push down on the keys either because I'm used to using a keyboard that didn't have much like\nTens you got like wait for them yeah like the way that you like pushed through that like strike of the hammer is your technique that I'm just not learning\nAnd I know we talked about this on a I ought to be the TV show for a local musicians and you said that you had started with a keyboard and then move to a guitar and now are you are you sticking with guitar have you has it been way over powering the piano time\nI it it's like I definitely practice my guitar way more than it's easier to access I guess I still like playing the keyboard and doing that stuff I Want to I don't like necessarily play piano like I'm not going to say reading can't do that but like I Need some courts and like I have a rough idea of like a melody\nDid you see when Julia was doing some slight reading the open might be able to yeah I\nReally cool is that like when people know languages and when people can read it blows my mind because I Can't do like I can do like to measures and then I could sit there like wait what is [laughter] especially with guitar sheet music like that yeah oh my gosh yeah that's how I started\nWith that I'm so glad I went to tabs after that and now I I just kind of look at the tablet or time or two and I can remember yeah what's up yeah definitely you use the ultimate guitar dot com for stuff\nSometimes but then sometimes it way wrong and I get not an expert on it to everyone else knows that they're like yeah\nOh my gosh I I put stuff on there before yeah and I hope that I mean I've gotten like one like five star review and I'm like\nAnd then you have the protests that you have to pay for like I'm not about to pay like a year to follow light here now yeah\nSpeaking of figuring out what would it would have you figured out for us next what are we going to what are we gonna hear next from Egypt\nUm I'm going to do a stereotypical cranberry sauce on because I like this on the line\nBut I write because ... you ever hear the tremors uh\nPeople know what's going on nine thirty here on this Wednesday night stick with us it's Ninety point one local limelight W. I. UPS you\n... he's in Studio we're delighted to have you do when you're taking away the creditors to me\n...\nMy hands God no\nI Am and who are we in the ...\nAnd it's just the it's non stop\nThey are trying to see\nThe na na na na fonder\nAnd a gun\nHe\nWe can ... and\nWe do know\nVe to take ...\nMy God do you live in Lima\nBeans I think and [noise]\n\nPlease send\n\n\nMe\nCan can you explain just in brevity what that to the concept of that album was\nUm they took different horror movies and then pretty much meat songs about them and I really like the one about it like no one's\nPretty good I think it's called the silver screen yeah yeah so check that out of here in the ... type of stuff\nWas what was interesting yeah [laughter] I feel like like\nReliant K which is another being I don't know the actually still make music but they had another like the the Halloween ... and not many people make like Halloween music\nYeah so I'm like oh so they they made a song about a butter finger cup which is one of the best candies ever so wow what do you think is the most underrated holiday ooh probably when I don't know about ... percent wow wow that's a\nThing that that it'd be a can't be wrong yeah oh my gosh I was not expect I was having\n[laughter] that's what I thought I Would\nThat's why that's why the answer you are wise on New Year's me\nI Can't imagine how smart you'll be after you get through our UP you're going to be cut and stuff down I ... I got a lot of swear when I get all motivated like this yeah really heated over here and that that's a good question what about underrated housing underrated candy I dunno I preface it by Halloween candy but most underrated candy\nUm butter finger cops those are so good and also a cherry Hershey kisses their only run and Christmas Time so I get like seven dogs and stock up but then I eat them all before January and so\nNow you said butter finger ... ... let's let's do a comparison dive into that because we got butter finger cups or Reese's peanut butter squared the kind of the kind of brothers yeah okay\n[laughter]\nI Would hope so [laughter]\nI Love it releases I've never had a square is it more peanut butter chocolate ratio 'cause I don't like to\nKnow it's less so that peanut butter chocolate ratio that you get from races it's like a little more like chocolate I mean it says peanut butter squared so makes you think it'd be like\nTo listen to the end to the degree exactly that's what you have you but it's more like I don't know it's better for the reason I got to be honest receives ... could maybe chill out a little bit on the amount of peanut but I agree it's too like\nWell like peanut butter amount of weight that bomb like don't got that recipe mhm\nBut when it's kind of like the artificial peanut butter fried yeah middle it's like okay this is like kind of nasty like I kind of I'm discuss\nI mean yeah I mean having like even just like our Hershey bar with just peanut butter scoop like that's better than Hershey bar yeah yeah I agree I agree with you yeah I Do you go [laughter] I sure have these\nGroups I the cherry um Hershey kisses isn't great\nThey do good I've never heard of that yeah I mean I knew the cherry chocolate stuff yeah it's you know it's so good [laughter]\nSomething that I think is under recognized and I mean like I think people know about it a chocolate covered pretzels in like\nTruly I Would say that's one of the most underrated a delicious combo 'cause you get the salty sweet and get a little bit of that crime in their villages hook me up with some chocolate before the show good land and he went on some good stuff dance miss candies and guess they didn't even know it was about to give them free advertising\nTonight they welcome You're welcome call underwriting You're welcome dirty than [laughter] I mean ... yeah man really good stuff well now that we've uh plugged ... or ... peanut butter and Hershey's chocolate I did have uh\nWe're going to only blow you away from here on that well there was nothing plugged in we wouldn't have any power so oh my gosh we\nWon't blow but we also want on slug I'll just get these two mute button so it'd be in touch with our heads off over here you would have gotten

you\n\nMe to read this Jamie am some time\nSome time to do any at all\nYou know shows\nAre really good he's a funny\nTime not so\nYou like you're the only envy and sell\nBut I get that high\nYeah just to do how do you do and it's not what they say how you see and I know I think as\nLong as I say oh\nIt is not yeah\nMm\nDo you use their keys to get inside your house\nOr you gamble on\nNo it's not like you say how you see I Know how long does this thank\nGod is not to do\nDo\nOkay I just now would you do\nDo not want to say\nShe and I know have you on the same\nBut it's not you\nKnow it's not
