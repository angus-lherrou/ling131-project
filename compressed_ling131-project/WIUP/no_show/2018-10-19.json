I'm Out of that me welcome to the big picture science produced at the SETI Institute where researchers investigate the nature of the origin of life\nAnd they picture science we give you the why didn't go view and science and technology heredity was once I understood to be straightforward genes were passed from parents to offspring and you were blessed or stuck with a lot you got DNA did not change over a lifetime well now we know that isn't true your environmental\nTools lettuce tinker with genes directly editing them or adding new ones and there may be evidence in both cases that one generations genetic alterations can be inherited by the next\nIn this episode the science of epigenetics NASA's astronaut twin study editing the mosquito genomes to prevent malaria and how all the challenges are traditional concept of heredity its DNA is not destiny\n[noise]\nWe have two stories each from an unusual laboratory where experiments in genetic modification are testing our old notion that DNA is destiny the second will come later in the show but we can tell you that both labs share something in common there are secured with air locks\nThe first air lock as necessary because there is no air and space [noise]\nWell the air lock the doors to the international space station that allows you to go outside into space and hopefully I can because could make it back inside\nThis is Scott Kelly a former NASA astronaut us fighter pilots [noise]\nKathleen Kelly was on the international space station for about a year during which time something funny happened to his DNA and we know that because scientists compared Scott's DNA with that of his identical twin brother mark on earth the results of this NASA twin study revealed the workings of at the genetics\nHello I'm Christopher mission and welcome to the most in an associate professor of genetics in computational\nBiology Dr Mason and other researchers involved in this unique study we're looking to see how the body and the genome respond to living in space so here's the setup while Mark Kelly\nThe international space station for a year\nYou know as an astronaut your job is to not only fly the vehicle and you know operate the hardware for fish but it's also should be [noise] you know experimental subject I think\nResearchers ran a suite of tests and the twins before and after ... here in space\nAnd so we do all kinds of sequencing on a limb various levels was in the south in DNA Arnie proteins\nReally small molecules in the cells we looked at large scale changes like in what happened in his ask you a journalist who happens veins and arteries also his cognition was measured by or some other researchers was looking at what happens for his reaction time and how quickly can solve puzzles\nRequired me to take a lot of you know samples of you know bodily fluids and it required me to do a lot of cognitive tests required me to do a lot of imaging on you know certain parts of my body with ultrasound\nWhile you were on board the space station yeah absolutely\nThe researchers wondered if they see at the genetic changes and Scott Kelly's DNA when he returned\nEpigenetics is the idea that DNA is not six but can change due to environmental factors are going to hear the results of this study but first let's consider this startling idea of epigenetics from the genes point of view\n[noise]\nSay your team you're short section of the double helix DNA molecule tightly bundled into a chromosome out in the nucleus of the sound is not the nucleus of the newly fertilized egg cell you can relax\nYou successfully made it into a new host and now you're one and only job as a gene is to express yourself turn on and produced some proteins or stay mute and don't it's straightforward\nExcept that we now know that there are other chemical players involved with this simple scenario as a gene you may have noticed that you and the rest of the DNA is not floating around\nAlone and naked in that sell you're surrounded by an attempted to a bunch of other molecules they're mostly protein some called histone ... that are the schools\nAround which the DNA double helix wraps\nDon't worry these chemicals don't mess with you directly as a gene you stay intact\nBut they do determine how and when and if you do your genes thing this is known as epigenetics\nReporter Carl Zimmer and it's an incredibly important area because to understand how our cells work it's not enough just to have a catalog of genes you actually have to\nSee those genes and their three dimensional reality as they're being controlled and responding to the environment\nSo you're a gene that you're gene behavior is tied to the behavior of at the genetic chemicals and their behavior is tied to whatever your host organism experiences what kind of food is it eating is it breathing clean air under stress at work is it living in an artificial habitat about two hundred and fifty miles up in low earth orbit [noise]\n\nAstronaut Scott Kelly spent a year on the I. S.\nS. now let's find out how his DNA compared to that of his brother mark once he returned home okay Chris so the idea was tested these guys both before and after Scott Kelly space flight so you expected that Scott who spent all this time and space\nThe ground I mean that per se isn't so much a surprise as it\nThat's right yeah so we really any point of any day when you're moving through the environments when you eat spicy food you know when you have a big gulp of soda you're gene expression how what you can get turned on and turn off\nWill change and does change receipts a response to what you're doing what you're eating and what you're encountering in the world and that is also part of that project just controlling a with gene get turned down and turned off in what's called our age\nAnd so that's what we report is that actually there were some genes that got turned on when he was in space are actually thousands of them and then when he came back to earth it turns out after six months they were still activated as if they were still in space and so we called the genes\nThat seem to be almost so perturbed genes from space flight\nThat we want to keep an eye on because we don't know when or if there were turned back to sort of a baseline state\nDoubt what do you think caused this change in these genes I mean was it I don't know the hard radiation in space or they'll you know lower levels of oxygen or I don't know maybe even weightlessness has something to do with it\nYes when exciting thing about gene expression is it the molecules themselves of our and they can tell you a wouldn't genes that came from and then so what genes are that are responding so we saw an genes activated\nFor everything from bone repair DNA repair and don't formation and also immune immunological stress we saw all these genes changing all of which seem to win or the genes you would expect a seat changing when you are are really in zero gravity and weightless and also being you know slightly higher radiated when you're up in the space station\nBut we aren't certain of that research on non human species suggests that at least some of the changes can be passed down\nReporter Carl Zimmer whose latest book is on the science of heredity describes those studies and what the NASA twin studies says and does it say about changes do astronaut Scott Kelly's DNA\nSo what is happening in a study like that is that the actual a sequence of letters and Scott's genes is not being rewritten by being in space\nBut when scientists look at his cells before and after and compare them to his brother mark they can see that there are epigenetic differences they can see that the ...\nIn some cases and then maybe it would be in the case of Scott's\nSome genes are turned on and they're turned off due to environmental factors could those changes in those genes or the activation or the dorm at state of ... be passed on to another generation\nAh well that is a very big controversy I'm so this is something called a trans generational epigenetic inheritance nice big craze and so the idea there is that an experience that a person or some other species has\nAlters the epigenetics and theirselves that includes germs cells in other words egg and sperm that that can then produce the next generation and that next generation the idea goes can inherit those epigenetic changes along with the genes\nAnd so there are lots of really good compelling examples in nature that this can indeed happened uh they just don't really include humans\nCan you give us an example of how it might happen\nSure so let's say there's a plant and minding his own business and it gets attacked by some insects\nSo plants switch on a bunch of genes when they sense this sort of attack and they produce a bunch of chemicals that the hope is quote unquote to drive off the insects or at least sort of minimize their attack\nPlants that experience an attack from insects or or pathogens they will produce seeds and if the when those seeds grow into new plants they will actually respond faster to these kinds of attacks than they would have otherwise like they have a memory yeah\nAnd the same is true of the seeds that you produce from those plants um\nAt the [noise] the orbit of the international space station let's say that Scott had fathered a child in space when he was his molecules are undergoing these changes is it possible that anything that has changed in ... we said his DNA did not change but any of these epigenetic factors could have been passed down to his child\nNo evidence from humans that it could have and part of that reason for that is that it seems that plant biology and animal biology are very different and the way that epigenetics is controlled in both kinds of organisms is different\nAnd so in humans during that process of an embryo developing producing its own eggs or sperm\nA lot of those epigenetic marks that may have accumulated in one's lifetime get stripped away in those cells and then I sort of a baseline set of epigenetic marks or put back in place\nSo in a way it's kind of like a racing memory in every generation\nThat doesn't necessarily totally closed the door on epigenetics in as in a kind of read it in humans there might be other molecules\nThat can also carry this kind of epigenetic inheritance forward and scientists are looking into these and and there are some studies on mice that are\nReally intriguing and really thought provoking and mice are closer to humans than plants are they are and so they exactly and so there there are these studies on mice\nFor example you expose mice to an odor and Everytime they smell this odor they get a shock and after a while\nThey learn that when they smell an odor is a shock coming and you can see how they respond to just smelling it the kind of an effect tense up the way you would if you kinda unconsciously knew something bad was about to happen and\nTheir offspring are also responding unusually to this particular smell\nSo it seems like these mice are inheriting memories which is really amazing to think about but on the other hand there are a lot of scientists who said well that this does not fit with\nAll sorts of things that are very well established in biology and so maybe the problem here is that these are very small studies and um what they are claiming to be a real effect is just random noise\nCarl Zimmer a science writer his most recent book is about the science of heredity and if you will recall we started the show saying we had two stories about genetic research each from a unique laboratory with an air lock well he'll return to tell you about the second one later in the show\nThe results of those most studies he described inspired research at the University of British Columbia in Canada into the long term effects of stress on humans the question\nCould the consequences of that stress be passed onto the next generation scientist studied the sperm at men who had experienced sexual assault in childhood and they discovered that a third of them carry the physical marker of that trauma now the marker or\nDNA tag was found in the sperm cells of twelve of the thirty four men study now what is a DNA tech well it's just a molecule one that contains C. H. three that's one carbon and three hydrogen Adam's called a metal group\nAnd such molecules can attach onto the DNA is double helix it's actually a common enough phenomena but the important thing is that these extra molecules can change the way a gene expresses itself\nWhat kinds of proteins that produces for example how many in like that\nThey can genes in your DNA as a little light bulbs says one of the study's researchers Nicole Gladys\nBooks are on or off and the specific thing that we looked at in the study is called DNA methylation they can think of that as a dimmer switch of those light fault so it's a tiny chemical peg on the DNA and depending on how many of these little tags are within a gene it acts as a Democrat and changes the amount of light emitted from that particular life all\nOkay so you're examining the sperm of men who had a history of childhood abuse to see whether that abuse had some you know I don't know effect on the sperm that would get passed on to their kids right\nPotentially this study definitely doesn't address whether that happens when it gets passed on to their kids but it does add to that first step of obviously if we think that these tags and the signature of if you can't get passed on and it would have to be present and the sperm and that's why we decide to look at sperm in these men\nOkay can you give me some idea of how abusers stresses kids would have changed the epigenetic chemicals of these these men obese adults\nYeah sure so one individual experience chronic stress or trauma they ended up being predisposed to various diseases in adult such as cardiovascular disease cancer type two diabetes and these diseases all have this kind of pro and inflammatory aspect to them so what we hypothesized is\nThat these diseases later in life can pop up decades after the trauma because your body can't sustain chronic stress for long periods of time because it's not good for your\nBody obviously to suppress all of these systems in order to give you that fight or flight response\nSo what we think is happening is that your body tries to reach a new normal and you'll homeostasis and that uh all the extra course on hormone being released has to be balanced by is regulating the immune system reproductive system and other systems and this this regulation over time can produce these diseases and then that same\nMechanism with potentially lay down these marks on the DNA\nOkay are are those what you called DNA tags\nIndeed and Texas actually\n... found in there and it's got the codes for everything is going to become the kid but\nA a DNA tag\nI'm thinking of my luggage what what what is a tag and how does that get passed on\nYeah so the DNA tank is like a little methyl groups like a little edition of added\nProtein so if you have your DNA and it's kind of as read by proteins like little machines kind of common bind to the DNA and essentially read that\nCode and those same proteins can actually then attach these tiny little monkey ... onto the DNA is kind of like a bookmark saying like this is an important gene to turn on and off in a situation than those tags\nAre then I went to sell replicate there's proteins that make sure that those tax day exactly where they should be in the next generation\nOkay so if I understand this correctly nickel the history of abuse doesn't actually change the DNA in the springtime I mean that's Darwin ride the DNA is the DNA back yeah but it might change the expression of that DNA so\nAnd we're actually basically in an era lock he turns to an inner door opens that one up and we'd go into his lab which is an insect Terry him as a place where he raises thousands of mosquitoes\nThe lab is abuzz with research because while a mosquito may look non threatening I mean it's small enough to purge on a finger nail no insect species who's been a more efficient killer for one they carry malaria a disease that deals death to hundreds of thousands of people a year mostly children\nThe gamble at the University of California Irvine inserted gene into a mosquito that will stop its deadly parasite passenger and then release those genetically modified insects into the wild\nThe gene editing technique CRISPR allows for these precise in rapid edits which when combined with gene drive greatly increases the chances that the genetic modification are inherited again and again\nCarl Zimmer's visit to Anthony James in sectarian was part of the research for his latest book she has her mother's laugh the powers perversion some potential of heredity it explores among other things how having the power\nInside this insect ... where the mosquitoes bussing all around you how close did you get to them\nSo you know this is not a place where you're just like in one gigantic cloud of mosquitoes of it it would be very hard to do research and to breed these mosquitoes if they were just going around willy nilly\nThey're managed at each stage of their life cycle\nSo when they're when they're large of a um swimming around in water which is what ... does do and so they are in these little Tupperware tubs that are sealed in their off in their own room\nAnd once they have developed into um the adults with wings then they're put in jars the where the males and females mate\nAnd then the females that need to drink blood and so they get transferred to of all things these movie popcorn tubs\nWhere James and his colleagues stick this little container of warm blood on top of the lid and then the mosquitoes are underneath ... sticking their\nLittle ah mouth parts through a membrane to drink the blood so they're all sort of hanging upside down feeding on blood it's quite bizarre it's\nA good luck for the mosquitoes 'cause they get free refill ... hey that's\nRight as much blood as you can handle and then and then once they're ready to lay eggs than they are transferred into a dark room because female mosquitoes like to be in the dark when LA their eggs\nAnd they put in other jars and then um they lay their eggs there and then they die and the scientists extract these little strips of eggs which they then take to insert DNA into it does have a little creepy factor\nYou know the cow's blood we could all yeah no there's there there's definitely a creeping is to it but then at the same time you think well you know what if what I'm looking at the cure for malaria\nI mean that would be in a mate\nDrinking blood is and it's worth it I Wonder if you could describe how he is using CRISPR to genetically modify these mosquitoes in order to eradicate malaria\nSo it James who wants to do is to produce a population of mosquitoes that cannot carry malaria and similarities caused by a parasite a person's sick with malaria has a parasite in their blood mosquito bites them takes in the parasite and then goes off and by somebody else spread the disease\nSo what if a a mosquito as soon as it took in the malaria parasite kill the parasite with its own antibodies\nThan you would break the chain and malaria would disappear so James has been working for years and years and years trying to figure out the basics of how that might work\nAnd he's found part of the solution which is that he discovered that there's a particular kind of antibody that can wipe out malaria parasites inside mosquitoes and so he can actually answer that gene\nFor that antibody into the mosquitos now the problem is that you could engineer some mosquitoes with that gene and then you send them loose in the wild and\nThey're surrounded by millions of ordinary mosquitoes that don't have that particular uh engineered gene and within a couple of generations um that engineered gene might just have disappeared from the gene pool and just be gone because they're all the mosquitoes meeting like crazy and shoveling their genes and\nThat's it so it wouldn't wouldn't really do much good\nBut what CRISPR does is give you this way to actually drive that gene into more and more mosquitoes over the generations so what James and his colleagues are doing is actually putting the genes for CRISPR into the mosquitoes along with that\nSo inside the mosquito larvae or you might have one copy of a chromosome that has the antibody Jean and the CRISPR gene and the other chromosome is just ordinary\nInside of that mosquito the CRISPR molecules get produced and they rewrite the DNA and the other chromosome so now you have two copies of antibiotic gene whereas the mosquitoes start out with just one and then it's going to pass on that CRISPR antibody package to its descendents\nSo it's a process that's sometimes called gene drive because it just drives this gene further and further into the population and there are a mathematical models suggest that it would take just a matter of a few years\nTo basically have the entire population carry this malaria proof gene how far has he gotten in the lab and doing this well they're they're producing these mosquitoes generation after generation that are resistant malaria and there are other groups that are doing this as well and so\nYou know there's no reason to think that you won't have a mosquito stock ready to go to be released into malaria intense place like Africa or India you know within the decade if we searches\nAnd it seems like a win win because people in general not fans of mosquitoes and malaria is a deadly disease so why not wipe out the disease and if you wipe out some mosquitos too if that happens\nBut could there be unforeseen consequences of course because they are unforeseen but you know we're talking about eliminating a disease maybe even limiting the mosquito itself has that were to happen it could be a downside to that\nThat could be so one kind of application of gene drive that people have talked about is sounds kind of paradoxical but it is to drive a gene for\nIt's a species mouse that you don't like you want to get rid of 'em so basically what would happen is that you know mosquitoes are mice that inherited this gene would have ... much fewer offspring and uh and then the more that the gene would spread the smaller the population would get until they were just crash\nOr what if with the mosquitoes that are malaria proof does that somehow give them some I don't know some reproductive edge or some disadvantage that we don't even know about are you going to disrupt mosquito ecology and people might say like mosquitoes who cares about them well you know there are lots of\nSpecies that eat mosquitoes in lots of other species that eat the species eat mosquitoes and what happens if you start to tinker with that\nHow how do you pull CRISPR back out of the wild once you've set of loose um to sometimes is that you know maybe we shouldn't even be talking about using this for conservation at all\nHave any of this mosquito has escaped Anthony James lab is there any way of telling whether or not one of these altered mosquitoes has escaped ...\nIt's not like the mosquitoes they'll have like little trackers on them but um there are just many many uh safeguards in place to keep mosquitoes getting out it's not just an air lock 'em it's all sorts of safeguards that are there you know ways of killing off mosquitoes that that get out and also\nI think one of the most fundamental safeguards is that these mosquitoes that he studies are not\nNative to uh Southern California and in fact they're native to it in a totally different environment in India\nA very lush moist environment Irvine does not moist it's a you know as a sunny dry place and so it's basically like if those mosquitoes get out there just going to just drop dead in the parking lot probably so yeah there are\nSafety that will extend to other experiments in the future because you know if they can really you know stabbed Bush\nA mosquitoes that and really prove that they that CRISPR makes them resistant malaria that and that it passes down sustainably through the generations really works as they hope it works [noise]\nThey're gonna have to do a test out of a side of the lab they're going to have to find some place where they're going to um do a limited release and see how well it works\nAnd that is a big deal because you know it's it's kind of open ended I mean once you really do just you know set a mosquito out in an environment where can thrive\n[noise]\nWe should have some\nThe ... do\nYou think I'm I'm\nWay to do that now and again it's just a little bit when it got me down not hard to get out and and now with them dreaming open do

Indiana [noise]\nDo you are you ... ... ... ... times [noise]\n\nHello and welcome to sports talk live friday edition good afternoon everyone ... junior joined by ... and Jeff ... how are we doing today I'm doing great man another friday where\nWe just sit down and talk about sports sit down shut up and drink a beer with master any anything else going on today I let him my day\nYeah so we have a fantastic show to get to um several things to talk about there's a lot going on to the sports world so let's get right into it we have a brand new segment once again for everyone today we are going to be doing the mount Rushmore of individual sports\nSo who wants to start out with their Mount Rushmore of sports\nOh wait right okay I'll go first [noise] All right so for my sport in my mouth Rushmore I Am doing the NBA and in the spirit of basketball I Know Mount Rushmore only has foreheads however I mean a five because they're five positions and basketball and I'm going to make them by position\nNot how it works hey no it's a it's his he's the only one that's a lot to do\nAnd see I Want to get this out of the way before I get started when I Do find the best of all time I don't want to simply talk about Akhil accolades an individual achievements to me what to find the best from the greats is that you enhanced the rest of your team and we're not just about yourself\nSo with that in mind my point guard I Am Magic Johnson\nHe ranks fits all time is this five MBA titles and honestly as one of the flashy as players ever redefined the point guard position and he brought Showtime to LA and played with a great team with an old Kareem Abdul Jabbar and just a bunch of those guys and I I think he is very deserving of being on this list\nNow from a shooting guard I don't have to give too much or explanation into this one Michael Jordan I think the statute for themselves six titles five time MVP six finals MB and ten time NBA offers team I think the stats speak for themselves I don't think anyone will ever surpass Jordan\nIf anyone tries to say that LeBron is better they're wrong I'm Jordan is the best change my mind\nI'm so for small forward now I'm going to get controversial for my small forward I have koby Bryant\nNow some of you who are basketball nuts out there saying wait but Jeff Kobe Bryant he's a shooting guard\nKobe Bryant actually identified himself as being a small forward for most of his career when asked and he actually played the last three to four years as a designated small forward for his team Coby is third all time scoring Lubrano seventh because I Know most people are going to say oh how could you leave all brawn off the list\nCoby was all defensive team twelve times LeBron was six times Coby has five championships\nAnd a better winning percentage in his championship while the brown has three and has lost many more Coby well maybe not a great pastor was great in all other endeavors and to me when I Want to get I Want to win the game\n[noise] for power forward I'm going with Tim Duncan I mean not too much debate on this one for me I don't think there are too many players that can speak to the levels of Tim Duncan he's a five time champion I mean\nTo me it's amazing that he wasn't a flashy player by himself you they called him Mr fundamental for a reason I mean Shaq check made fun of them all the time because he was\nThere's not flashy about Tim Duncan but he gets it done I mean rookie of the year three time finals MVP and two time leave you have any ... I think Tim Duncan is very worthy of being on this list of most um NBA aficionados will tell you that he is the best power for whatever\nNow for center I'm going to have to go a shack a lot of people may say cream\nI think Shaq because when you also talk about the best that your position you had to redefined how it was played I've yet to see a freak of nature like Shaq\nUm he just absolutely dominated the pain I've never seen a player absolutely dominate like Shaquille O'Neal I mean third all time scoring and I mean for championships and with two different teams mad um he won with a with the heat and the Lakers so I think Shaq has shown all the right skills to me\nTo put him over Kareem because he just\nHe he redefined that position and played in an era that was so competitive and the only change from under him I mean that weird nineties the two thousands conversion the league was changing so as far as my my Rushmore that's who I Am so far um guys any comments on that or any disagreements\nI like that actually I like that you put more Michael before the broad especially the but the despite the entire debate behind that I think it's a valid debate I'm Talking about the people who really love abroad I can name one here wants my high school and I think he is he's nuts as you said um\nI really agree with your statement him Duncan's a little iffy on the whole power forward thing but the has proven its case time and time and again I I for the most part I agree with your with your with your list I think\nShoppers that no no it isn't it isn't that I just think that Kareem has had just an overall better career personally I'm watching\nA film on him live throughout my points out yeah yeah and it's it's just insane when he was able to do as a player\nUm but Shaq I definitely do believe is number two just because like you said he redefined the center position um I just for whatever reason I just can't put a shack ahead of cream I could see why I said I think that's another point a lot of people will say that\nI think a lot of it is to opinion I mean they both have they both have a staff to back them both up and I I that's why I like you were just as with cream and then Jeff decision was Shaq the only thing I think the thing I think that's the two apart Shaq has more of a personality that green did\nAnd I think a lot of people notice a more that in ... I Can't handle the free throw line to save his life that's where a lot of things the admissions or I I I really want\nTo think you also have to take into account the that people our age never we never got to see Corinne play we get we got to see the end of ... release\nLate middle and so we at least got to see him play and see how dominant he was it's kinda hard for us to give our opinions on the guy we only see replays up in the game was totally different in the in the seventies and eighties I mean it's not even close to the same game\nYeah I'm center I think is probably in my opinion the hardest position to really go after because there's been just so many started centered on shore right I mean I really love Oscar Robertson for peace and yeah it was something about him and have for God's sake [laughter] your veil McGee\nA nail area that are just actual name military most people don't know that but ah wilt Chamberlain we even talk about ... book Chamberlain one of the best players of all time as well ... yeah so very very good list Jeff I ... I Know that you had a very difficult time debating cause\nUh in my opinion was going to be the MBA so ah hold your horses 'cause we gotta lock Helena coming here yeah definitely [noise] All right so\nObviously with all the way I did it was in the old outfield manager in ... in the field without a doubt Jackie Robinson changed the game for the better broke the color barrier and how the numbers of proven\nOver three thousand hits I Believe just an a star studded career I I I didn't pull it many facts that 'cause I 'cause there is no real you don't need an explanation for that\nMy picture Walter Johnson and oldies but goodies he is one world series champion he won the ale he ... a few times heated triple crown winner for three seasons that it's hard to do um he's just an absolute dominant force when he takes the hill I'm even through of no hitter on my birthday so that kinda\nThat kinda [laughter] and explain to the non baseball veers but the ... with the triple crown is for pitching the triple crown is I Believe strike out ...\nAnd ... I Believe when they're still Windsor whip I forget um will pull it up but\nBut yeah Walter Jones and he's one he's let those three categories and if he didn't win the triple crown he is definitely a close second or third\nI'm switching to the outfield I'm going to go a little bit of Homer move Roberto Clemente one of the greatest you know he also in that generation Jackie Robinson maybe the end of it\nBroke the color barrier as well had numbers prove it it's sad that his life was taken too early by plane crash because I Know he left his stats with three thousand flat three thousand hits a two hundred forty ... home run\nCould have had a little bit more of an off on the home run scale um batting average of lifetime with three Seventeen absolutely amazing\nYes a lot of people don't think the cowboys I've ever won the Superbowl however Tony Blair said let them do that from I was in law who\nWho does not believe that the cowboys have ... I talked to a lot of younger just sharing the cowboys you know all about it [laughter] most noxious fan base in any sport oh you\nHaven't been to Philly but OK wide receiver Marvin Harris in Indianapolis\nInteresting pig I think that is an interesting\nPick one thousand one hundred to receptions fourteen thousand five hundred eighty yards one hundred and twenty total touchdown he is responsible\n... 'cause I did not actually lift off everything that made him great to me for time pro bowl one time all pro over two thousand rushing yards Seventy seven touchdown he's also a hall of famer\nAnd now for my defensive person means Joe green from the Pittsburgh Steelers he's a defensive tackle you grew up during the steel courting Eric ... shaped that they are still the through the curtain themes\nUm the Steelers before his arrival in Pittsburgh where one Thirteen ... basically the browns or cardinals of the seventies\nWhenever he came they push a playoff run at least three to four years after that and he's also a tense I'm pro bowler and hall of famer that is my Mount Rushmore and by the looks on your faces you do not agree with most of my favorite\nAuto auto ... I Do not agree with ... that is no there have been ... at especially on the ground and that is as competitive especially at the quarterback position which is so competitive and there have been so many great ones I highly disagree\nYou really ought to grandma's top three on the all time quarterback was raped\nI still disagree I'm Sorry that's fine I don't I don't mind that I actually y and Z has a player if we're not debating not eating I don't know what we're talking about you represented your position all time above everybody else I Would have told him\nI I understand that and that's the title why victims I knew it would start a debate between all of us I only picked him because no one recognizes him he'll do we think about his Brady and pretty much all these other quarterbacks like Joe Montana the young all these people do grab the hidden gym in my in my opinion\nHis revolutionary for his time definitely especially with that he played with the browns and now look at them yeah but the bronze aren't the same as they were back then I mean you're right but\nDifferent things like that and I also I'm going to have to disagree with or set as well he wasn't even the best running back for his team I Would put Emmett Smith ahead of doors said I'm not debate door set is awesome\nAbove it not not saying you're I I think Joe green was Assad bacon I could see the justification for Marvin Harris and but I have to heavily disagree without ... disagree with or said\nGood stuff I was looking for oh okay [laughter] All right Steven would you like to go\nOkay I Gotcha okay so quarterback I Will\nBe picking Drew Brees as my quarterback\nYes what Jeff ... Jeff I picked Drew Brees face because I did to most career oh Wow Did you\nShared a okay well let's just read office at most career yards just beat it but he has ... inching closer and closer to him and Tom Breyer really edging closer and closer to the all time passing touched on record\n'em and Drew Brees also have the best completion percentage at sixty seven percent of his past since sixty seven percent is just insane\nFor a passing completion I did was list Tom Brady at number two just because of the super bowl rings and his overall stats\nAs much as it pains me to pick him at number two I just felt like Drew Brees overall has done just insane job really an underdog story being told they use too short to play the game coming out of college\nAnd to become one of the best quarterbacks ever play the game is fantastic I'm sure Jeff will be reading off more satisfied him later\nBut I picked a running back I picked Barry Sanders Barry Sanders that's running back ever [laughter]\nSame one oh my gosh shepherd I get a quick uh she's you know because then that would be untruthful I'm not going to change my all time was just a grim medium and we're fake and not changing my legs just\nSingle season he played he only played at ten seasons and racked up Fifteen thousand two hundred and sixty nine rushing yards now I did the math and Emmett Smith of course the all time leading Russia I add up before I came into the studio\nAnd I just gave very Sanders even nine hundred yards the next the next couple of see the next four seasons the same amount so that they would both be even with amount of seasons they both flights and Barry Sanders would still be Emmett Smith by over six hundred Russian yards that's hard to believe\nVery seniors only had Ninety nine rushing touchdowns but\nLet's just look at what the line squad was back then he did not have an often from lines of block I've I've watched taped on him several times and he would have to run twenty yards just to get maybe three yards on the ground so that's why I include him as my best running\nBack ever moving on defensive lineman Reggie White I have\nJust don't have it okay All right and he's got a regular white has one hundred and Ninety eight ... second all time probably the hardest player I had to pick\nI knew I wanted to go with a defense on line ... linebacker tempted to go with Lawrence Taylor but I just decided to go at Reggie White just because he was a very scary man to play against\nAnd uh if you have a chance to watch the football life on Reggie White is a great story fans has very sad story but a very very up a ... where we sat through uplifting yet uplifting story and maybe\nMy favorite player of all time is my last Dick night train lane Dick night training lane is force\nHe if you ever get the chance to look up\nAnd I trained lane highlights he is taking players heads off he is just ... and he he's the reason why players have concussions got on me about Tony Dorsett at an auto Graham yeah but I'm highly offensive but nitrate lane is\nHe's ... he's my favorite player to water their warning he's my favorite player to watch I I just feel like night train line is the definition of what football is supposed to be he was always a hard hit her and he was always around the ball every single play\nSo that as my not rush one like it thank you back on the other hand probably wouldn't 'cause like half of it was\nAll right so for my quarterback cause I chose quarterback running back wide receiver and defensive player\nFor my quarterback I as well picture breach now seeping already read you his impressive says I don't really think or I Need to harp on that anymore However I'm going to tell you where he ranks use force all the time in ... um he is the first time in passing enforce the all time in passing touchdowns Super Bowl champion now a lot of people say wait\nBut how is it not Tom Brady five championships I mean the accolades become cells and it's a major reason Tom Brady are the same type of player and they're both they're not the right height their short and like when you look at their athletic skill set nothing speaks out at you as like wow those guys are athletes those are like NFL quarterbacks because out of the draft both of them were\nNever really considered high level players for their position however\nAnd a lot of people will actually say well gee ... played in the dome that is true I don't\nI Do think it helps but ... you don't play the dome sixteen games in the season it does help but you're right it doesn't completely sweat but the reason I put him in front of ... because Brady isn't it amazing off into the system I have said week after week Nobel a check is the greatest coach ever\nPatriots can literally plug in anybody at running back and they have been successful I mean I can name at least six different running back in the past few years that will have a great stats that for I don't I'm not only that wide receivers as well yeah he's he's thrown the most passing touchdowns the authority of wide receivers so\nI think the system really ... I don't think breezes ever had a very strong supporting cast\nOr coaching system to help him I'm running back I also pick berries Sanders a third of all time and rushing top ten rushing touchdowns and all the time my biggest reason is he played for an inferior team in the Detroit Lions um he redefined that position because I've never\nI've ... when you look at the replays of berries and there's I have yet to see a player that\nHas his playing style I mean he just a quick moves and just the manner in which he played he redefined his position because like I said with the basketball is you have to redefine your position and make everyone better he made his team better that lion steam was horrendous rattle lions have never really been a strong franchise I mean\n... nothing but blow Viet and talk about how great their car was an athlete underwhelming and not produce this year so then once you get those regimes that you had to see how they pan out that's going to take another year or two\nSo he's got another four to six years before anyone is going to expect any major change because you can always use the excuse of always ... oh you know he's got to develop his players so and he's got ten years on his contract so open is going to take a hit no matter what\nYeah that's exactly what I went to I went to the contract and if there was a zero\nOn the list I Would put them at a zero because there's no way that the raiders are getting ready to John John gr and find out anyway moving on we have ...\nGoing to put them as before ... not in a situation Jason Garrett isn't however his team's not producing but I think it's because of the aging quarterback and you I mean you got one of the White House you have the best running back out\nAnd everyone thinks that it's bad no one respects the you know one and it's pretty like I Am going to refer and go back to this like I Do every week when your name is better than your playing ability if you know what I mean the manning face\nYou need to get out of New York or get out of the NFL you are not going to live up to paint and and I think you're actually you're actually not going to live up to your other brother who I forget his name\nPeyton no nothing there they don't have another brother now ... well there's arch either add ... dad okay what's what if they're not going to reach out the Archie OK you are you I Need to take his hits that he's not going to live up to their potential\nYou want a Super Bowl congrats you're tied with Peyton\nBut still I don't think classrooms and any either hot water but not too long [noise]\nI'm going to put them at a three that team is not producing I'm very conflicted because the giants\nHave gone through a lot of head coaches I'm Ben Mac and do last year I think the only reason he got fired was because he benched you lie for Gino Smith\nAnd I think that really upset a lot of New York fans because a lot of New York fed last year the whole team looked very lackluster and they had a lot of problems with injuries I mean when you had random Marshall get injured sterling Sheppard oh but I mean everyone you could think of got injured last year so they they just they put the blame on him so\nWhen you I think people see the potential in the giants because of ... and do it all back him so I'm going to have to not say he's ready to have to see how the season plays out because to me right now\nI think the problem like you said is Eli he he's very slow he doesn't get out of the pocket and he just he doesn't look like the same guy he when you look at the giants they do not look like they want to be out there I mean whenever I watch them play I see a team that just\nDoesn't have the fire in them anymore so what is\nDie for your potential you need to take a look at your organization and see the internal problems so the giants are going to have to do a lot of soul searching and see what the true problem is whether it be lie or the coaching but something has to change in New York\nSo I Will be putting him out of three as well my\nWife small hot say 'cause that was going to stay another season after this season but the giants will be drafting will Greer with their first round draft pick\nAnd he will be the successor to you I mean that's all I'm going to say about that uh all the reasons that you guys said really hit it on the head and yeah there's there's a lot of what Rob locker room problems at this point and just something needs change I think they'll give him another year though [noise] moving out we got Dan Quayle in\n... and ... he's the one on my scale he's got a good team I think he just needs to break out a little bit more plus a lot of his falcons are on the on the injury report on the new and Calvin Ridley I'm\nAll in all I still think they're a great team yeah they have they have taken their hard knocks the season but nowhere is Dan Quayle in in a position where he will get fired at the end of the year no way\n\nI'm going to put in going at a three maybe not for this year but for next year my\nBiggest problem is you go from being Super Bowl contenders and yes that was a heartbreaking loss of the patriots I mean Europe twenty eighth your bath on everyone else story they had actually under produce you have the former MVP and Matt Ryan\nWho has just looked way we're in just awful and everybody can take if he's overthrowing people he's not he's only ... to me he doesn't look like he's being a smart quarterback he's not making smart decisions he is just\nHonestly all I see from him as he is just looking for Julio Jones and he's only throwing to the play rather than throwing to the best receiver and making the best option I Do agree to have been injured the season but I haven't seen the Atlanta Falcons\nCoincidentally another Super Bowl that the patriots got handed to them that's for another time though um\nTo being just to me they're middle of the pack team in ... but it's just really disappointing when you look at what they are capable of and the amount of talent on that team with Matt Ryan Julio Jones democracy free minutes having Coleman I mean and on the defensive back field you got your roof on an al ... I mean NATO while Alford um\nIt's just very underwhelming so I think he needs to really get his team going\nI put him out of ... too\nI don't think that there's any chance of him leaving within the next few seasons but it's just the storyline and look out for as a season goes on is that land are going to be the same team as they were a couple of years back or are they going to head into a down slope especially what Matt Ryan my ride is big\nBig play a factor in that and I I just want to see what they're able to do for the rest of the year so far with that that was the other one that was good that's good stuff but we're gonna move around a little beep postseason now\nThe red Sox have launched their ticket to the world series after last night's last night's victory Jake your thoughts\nDisappointed but I Am happy for red for the red Sox to go back to the world series um they were strong all season and I know I have been kind of a downer\nIn saying that oh they're gonna they're gonna choke sometime soon but hey that's the red Sox do they prove you're wrong look back and forth story they look great I'm the only thing that I have a problem with his who's gonna who they're going to play\nI think if they play Milwaukee they're going to have an easy way off\nIf the Dodgers played them which I'm actually going to say the daughters win against Milwaukee tonight that's my time it was sort of customize socks from stance box um yes I have one right now but I really think LA has an edge going into this game um\nBut I think the red Sox and the Dodgers are going to play in the world series can grasp the red Sox um just keep it going forward man\nThose guys I think especially being last year's runner up for the I mean losing last year to ... I I really do think they have the experience necessary to take down the red Sox\nI said before the playoffs started the Dodgers have a huge ship on their shoulders as you said as they lost the world series last year the Astros thank goodness they're not going back for another like repeat matchup between the rows and oh gosh it turned into the NBA\nOr ... well yeah it's fine I respect the daughters more than I respect goals they warriors or any of them\nYeah the red Sox the most dominant team all season long there's no doubt about that well they're hating has been absolutely superb using their entire team ... top to bottom is just unheard of I I don't know how all support it's just\n... they're playing a video game numbers it seems as though the season and I ... I just think that the red Sox are the best team in the season and well I I don't know if there's any doubt but I think that they will go on to win the world series matter who they play [noise]\nI Would like to see a game seven between the Dodgers in Milwaukee things just because it just because I Love game seventh and ... except when they're my team but yeah\nI just think that the red Sox have the best team going forward I think that that this is their season if there's one season it's their season this year\nI really hope that I see the brewers advanced the world series because I Love underdog story I think they're huge underdog um but the Dodgers have given us something where they look to be the next World Series champions\nI mean I also would love to see a doctor's Red Sox match up because Dodgers have the best pitching and the red Sox have the best hitting I Would love to see that match up\nYeah so we're ... we're going to know for next week's worth ... we'll probably get in at least one world series game as as well\nI ... a football if we are going to be a way this week at Indiana University yeah buddy I pay five into going into this week again and two and five your thoughts [noise]\nWell last week be my first day began that was a a great experience to be there with you guys get to see however the first three quarters of last week scam or marry a underwhelming for forgivable an anemic up fast um one thing I Do want to say about ... football\nI think our coaching I think are we are a very emotional team\nWhen we started losing our players really start reflecting it and I want to see more from the coaching staff because other than the head coach I Am not see any of the coaching staff go into their players in either talking them up praising them yelling at them or doing anything to get any emotion out of their players the players rely on themselves to get any momentum going and when you have the coaching staff that's not\nWe ... we don't have that data\n\nI wanted to turn into what just happened on Wednesday and you're a bomb the Gaza Strip\nKilled yet another Palestinian\nYeah actually I was not able to follow the news on on that day\nAnd what about ... ... rally public opinion in your ... name\nBut Saddam is from the old testimony it means in the image and of course the idea they want to express here is one of the universal in Jewish values of all human beings are created in the image of God's\nElecting believe needs to happen\nWe believe that the only future that we would embrace that we would accept is the future that is based on these elevation of rights dignity and equality\nFor all people to live or to another ... than the terrain in at the Jordan River all sorts of meeting people Israeli and Palestinian now I don't know and we have no physician how many states exactly one states do states five and a half states they will be the right to political answer to that we don't\nPuerto Rican didn't will do for the people in the future agreeable solution and there was one obstacle incompatible future will do that is one of those roads which is what we're living in the ones that are three other people's includes we didn't ...\nWe're going to end it here and then we're going to continue in part to discussion and posted online under Web access that democracy now dot org\nGuy an odd is the executive director of the human rights group at selling it testified for only the second time before the U.N Security council I'll be speaking in Gainesville, Florida tonight Melbourne, Florida tomorrow checked democracy now dot org I mean he got caught\nYou listening to W.
