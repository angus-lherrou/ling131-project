know you're talking about leadership and how people leave when they get to the White House but I'll never become one of them it's too far away it's remote there on Mount Rushmore there on the currency so I realized if I started with them when they were young when they first recognize themselves as leaders when they were still going to screw up\nThen maybe young people and other people just aspiring to be leaders could follow their journey it didn't seem already made before you know how it's going to end up so that's how I began and I learned so much about them when they were young that I didn't know\nWhat are those are some things about the book though is is a warning or do those early years and that no one was on the same time to write write or as far as leadership and what we would consider great meals by the same token it certainly becomes apparent very early on your watch\nThat's what's really interesting I think it's true for for other people as well as for these people at a certain moment they find their vocation\nUm they there's a saying by William James the philosopher he said that a certain point you reach that if you're lucky something tells you this is the real me this is the voice inside it says that Lincoln is is is certain right away I mean when he's twenty three years old\nAnd he runs for office that first time and he has to put out of hand bill to say why he wants to have the job as a state legislator and it's incredible already at the age of twenty three he said every one has just peculiar ambition\nMine is to make myself such that I can be steamed off by my fellow man and be worthy of their esteem to think of that when you're twenty three years old and then he says he knows that he's only been in this town for six months of a new Salem they may not vote for him and if so he won't be very much for granted because he's been so used to disappointments\nSix times and then if I keep failing it'll be humiliating and I promise I Will try again I mean that's amazing so which show that he had resilience from that first time and he's going in already with the desire to\nDo something with ambition that's beyond himself teddy admits when he runs in twenty three that he's just going in for the adventure somebody comes to I'm a political boss says why don't you run\nAnd he doesn't have any thought he set of helping other people but then through politics he begins to learn um about decrepit tenements he learns about um child labor he's a police commissioner in New York and he sees what the slums or like at night\nAnd as a soldier he's sharing is food and shelter with other soldiers and he develops empathy he develops that desire to help other people\nAnd I think FDR was a little later in coming to that he was twenty eight he had been at Groton at Harvard Columbia Law school not a particularly great student not a very hard worker\nAnd then is it a Wall Street conservative law for him as a clerk and somebody comes to him and said would you like to run the duchess county seat in the Democratic party not because he had shown the makings of a leader but because his mother was wealthy and the Roosevelt name was good at might attract Republicans because they think it was teddy instead of FDR\nBut then once he gets on that trail the barn storming trail he loved it and he loved listening to people he loved talking learning about their lives\nYou realize this is what he was meant to be not that insulated kid from the elite background\nAnd Eleanor sat at the beginning when he was starting to talk he wasn't very good\nAnd he would toss between statements and you'd think he was never going to go on and she was so worried by the end of the campaign he would go on so long that you have to come and bring him off the stage\nAnd LBJ just from the time he was little hurt his father is in the state legislature he wanted so much to be a part of that life each traveled with his father on the campaign trail so the first time he comes on the scene is at a picnic and they have people coming to speak for themselves were running for office and then when the governor running who had given his father job and he wasn't there somehow\nTo the truck bed and he gives his stem winding speech and then he knows this is what I Want to be so it's a really interesting thing to see them but then they're going to have swelled heads they are going to do badly they're going to confuse are going to make mistakes and you don't know that they're going to become what they become until much later\nSo it is ultimately leadership that makes them good politicians versus politics me human good leaders\nI don't know I mean that's a really good question I mean I think what politics does is to expose them to a large number of people\nThat's why you know one of the things that saddened me about the twenty sixteen election was that political experience was considered a liability rather than a strain but for someone like Teddy Roosevelt or Franklin all of them actually\nMean Lincoln had been four times and the state legislature who was in the Congress he ran for the Senate\nThe experience of being a politician means that you see people and other stages of life in politics is done right and you begin to identify with them and understand them and I think that's what makes you a deeper leader then you were at the beginning\nAbraham Lincoln theatre Roosevelt Franklin Roosevelt and women Johnson so\nAlaska about why those for specifically been obviously before that you have your structure my\nGuys I lifted or God you know after a while when you live with these guys you feel like you're waking up with them in the morning you're going to sleep not going to sleep with them you're thinking about that when you go to sleep at night and and you feel like this is why am I doing this I'm spending my whole life with dead presidents\nAnd then I realized it wouldn't change it for anything in the world my only fear has always been that in the afterlife is going to be a panel of all these guys that I started and every single one will tell me every single thing I got wrong about that more than I mess and the first person to scream at will be Lyndon Johnson how come that down book on the Kennedys was twice as long as the book you wrote about me [laughter]\n\nIf you will get a judge from a store\nMaybe although you make a very good case for among those\nWell clearly I knew to Lyndon Johnson so I probably wouldn't have been a presidential historian without having worked for him so I did have this personal relationship with him and threw that relationship I help them in the last year of his presidency and that helped him on his memoirs with living with him ... times down at the ranch\nAnd I came to understand that however the war would always always tear apart everything he had done what he did domestically was extraordinary and in those last years old he was hoping that maybe he'd be remembered for civil rights\nAnd when I think of the accumulation of what the great society programs meant he meant that he didn't belong in that same category as embodied belong to be analyzed and to figure out why he was so successful in one area\nAnd perhaps not and the other but think about it three great civil rights laws ending segregation in the south providing that right to vote to African Americans fair housing Medicare Medicaid PBS headstart NPR immigration reform war on poverty it's extraordinary any one of those landmark laws would have made a presidential legacy\nSo I wanted to understand how he was able to do it especially in today's world how did he get Republicans and Democrats to go together and the Congress we needed so badly right now\nHow much of that is um is ingrained do think when I when we think of of leadership as you say as they come they they make all kinds of mistakes um all kinds of horrible things on them and these are not perfect mom\nAnd yet when it comes to leadership and different types of leadership but so\nYou know just exploring this I think there are certain leadership qualities that are in born\nI mean for some reason with Lincoln I think he was born with empathy he just even as a little kid when there would be other kids that were putting hot coals on turtles to make them regal he would go and say this is wrong he felt the pain in some way and he obviously was botched\n... was bought gifted with this natural optimistic temperament confident optimistic temperament and there'll be judged just had unfounded energy but for the most part they all made themselves leaders and Teddy Roosevelt wrote an essay wants two kinds of success\nWonder what's natural talent that no one else can compete with like a great poet perhaps or even a Lincoln a Gettysburg but most people success and he thought that was him are those that through hard sustained work develop whatever talents they have to extraordinary degree through the application of work\nBut then what they all went through that I think made them better leaders is they they all went through terrible adversity from what I've understood even about leadership as as Hemingway said once everyone has broken by life but afterwards some people are stronger in the broken places and that happened to my four guys\nLincoln had a near suicidal depression when he was in the state legislature and he hadn't been able to deliver on a promise to his constituents and he thought his word was the chief gem of his character and he'd also broken up as engagement with Mary Todd so he'd broken his word to her and it made him so sad when they took all knives and razors and scissors from his room\nAnd his best friend came to aside and said Lincoln you must rally or you will die\nAnd he said I Know that and I'd just as soon as I right now but I'm not yet accomplished anything to make any human being remembered that I have lived amazingly right that he can think that way when it comes out of the depression finishes the state legislature and then eventually gets a single term in Congress runs twice for the Senate loses twice and then when that runs is a dark horse candidate for the presidency but\nHaving been through that adversity when the war came he was used to that knowing how to strengthen resilience would somehow get him and the north through\nAnd then Teddy Roosevelt is in the state legislature and he is word that his young wife has given birth to their child to cigars go all around he gets a telegram then a second telegram comes our later saying your wife is dying and your mother is dying\nYou know he didn't want to read a novel so it wait on him even more because he couldn't relax and that's just the mind bill was going right exactly exactly you just have to\nSome replenishing of energy when we vote in history are we're voting for leadership or we're voting for the person that we feel will be the best leader or is that too often wants to be on\nI think it's the most important thing we should be thinking about when we vote for a candidate\nAnd I think it is too often left behind in the old days when the party bosses chose the people you're really much voting for your party and even now you know you're voting for somebody in a debate who said some things silly or losing your voting for who has the most money who's who represent certain issues that you may care about what you don't know whether he'll ever carry out those issues\nUnless you understand their temperament and their leadership [noise] you know are you somebody as we've talked about whatever they do have humility can you created team where you can share credit and you can shoulder blame for that team can you connect to the people emotionally um do you have a sense of being able to control your negative emotions\nThink about these qualities that I mentioned right now I'm ... do you keep your word we know all of the people have come from somewhere before most of the time they'd come from another political office until this last situation\nI'm an even with President Trump as a leader we could've seen what kind of leader was the what kind of teams did he bill did he built teams\nAnd you would know that about a governor and senator and if we could use that and that's the way journalists could cover candidates not just in a long magazine piece but how we talked about them temperament finally got raised in this last campaign at the end but it should be a ... a central quality I think we look at in our leaders\nBut I'm a new book is leadership and turbulent

Ninety point one tune it you won't forget\n[noise] [noise]\n\nWell some to counter spin your weekly look behind the headlines I'm Janine Jackson this week on counter spin we think all of our interviews are special but there are some that for one reason or another seemed to strike a chord in listeners\nMaybe because they engage questions that are often engaged or encourage alternative visions\nIn any event were happy for it and we're going to revisit three of those conversations on this week's show\nWe'll hear from writer and organizer Joe's march repeal about media hyping of gang violence and it's destructive impact on community\nMegan ... is director of the national coalition for the homeless we spoke with her about the criminalization of feeding homeless people as part of a campaign of eraser and finally you might think you can't\nThat from Kyle leans an advocate of the right to repair all of that is coming up this week on counter spin [noise]\nWhen local and federal law enforcement conducted an early morning rate in the Bronx in may twenty sixteen arresting more than a hundred people accused of gang membership tabloids didn't waste any ... words like alleged\nBut the New York times wasn't last cartoonish they told readers quote for the last ten years life in the northern Bronx has largely been defined by wanted violence klutz club\nAnd the times with no less quick to cheer for this kind of militarized intervention supposedly aimed at reducing violence counter spin asked a writer and organizer Joe's March when he'll for some context\nAs they can gain weight in particular are New York city or really in the United states but last Wednesday's raid the size of it and the media hype around it\nThey're expanding from the last I'd say like two to three years and probably even more so since the death of a police officer in in my neighborhood Spanish Harlem last October [noise] a lot of that had to do with the strategy of the district attorney ...\nMax's father was former secretary of defense under Jimmy Carter\nA five ads has really ambitious politically aspirations\nAnd so when he came in I think he wanted to take himself as like a gang busters if you look around the city today we're probably the slowest crime stats in cities history for like the last fifty years there is no new cheesy crime family you know there's there's no big name mobsters or gangsters out there [noise]\nSo how can you become a gang buster you find the gang members or maybe in some cases creator hype up what are known as cruise which are these local groupings of young men in public housing that a lot of fun\nIndicted when that had set there is the city's record up until last Wednesday another part of that might have been the arrival of bill Bratton\nHe not only has a lot of experience going after gangs in in Los Angeles when he was the LAPD chief but he's also a really good at squeezing out as much mileage out of the media in terms of law enforcement he's got a renowned for being like a media master out as much as a police mind so\nMy sense is that the rays and he's just a gardens last week which again is\nFirst of all in the context of a city that is like much much safer but even that particular neighborhood when you look at ... reports and the police department's own reports has crime stats for me the last\nSix seven eight years every single year more safe than the last and shootings and murders in particular which is what the media was hyping up the last ... report we saw was there was two shootings you to date so far and twenty six team\nSo getting not zero but definitely much lower than highs of New York city at its peak had a couple of thousand murders a year\nMy best sense is that the rate itself last week which included several federal agencies it's one of the reasons is federal charges are being used against the suspects are these guys no longer being tried in in state court being tried in federal courts\nOutward intention that's usually what happens in in in the case of Tampa we have to mention that there was\nA large college football event earlier this week and so it it was odd that even though there had been a law on the books for very long time that police and the city have not responded by asking the food not bombs folks to move along until\nThere was the event that a lot of people will be paying attention to in the city and and perhaps wanted not to see this kind of sharing a food or or are these you know quote unquote types of people in the city\nThere seems to be this idea that that somehow helping homeless people in this sense and feeding them he's creating are driving homelessness as though we didn't feed them they they wouldn't exist\nAnd we find that very troubling ah you know especially troubling because homelessness has so many causes and you know something that we have really highlighted in recent years with the increase the number of and ... are springing up across the country is their\nFirst of all there's a lot of not portable housing in our communities but also there's just not enough shelter either and unfortunately even even federal funding has been in recent years kind of tailored more towards permanent supportive housing programs which are extremely successful and really uh doing a great job of housing\nA small number of folks and so there's a lot more people who are just not finding the ... the resources or the help that they need on a daily basis but again I think what we see is\nNot just restrictions on feeding but also there's been lots of laws that restrict camping or sleeping even sitting down in public places are you sitting on sidewalks or even benches there's [noise]\nA public benches so that you can't lay down here in DC we have bus stop benches that have a little divider between the seats and they're very very skinny so that it would be very difficult to to lay down and be comfortable\nSo there's these little things here that\nAre subtly saying we don't want to see people who are homeless in our cities in our downtown areas you know we're trying to try to to move them along in any way we can\nAnd and we just think that this is really antithetical to ending homelessness and truly doing something to help people get off the streets\nAnd we understand that there's a lot of cities mayors who get a lot of feedback from the community of it that homelessness is a large problem but we're not going\nTo solve it by saying you can't be homeless here you know that that's not looking at all at the the causes of why somebody is homeless or really what the issues are that are preventing them from from getting an affording long term housing\nWell let me just ask you finally I guess folks who are motivated to do things we're all going to have to decide what our relationship to the law should be when we disagree with those laws that's gonna be a choice that I guess more and more folks are going to be making\nLet me ask you aren't they're not things that municipalities themselves can do you know we hear about\nPlaces making themselves sanctuary cities you know so maybe there's going to be a federal law that's pressing deportation but we're going to make a statement that are in our community we are going to do things differently are there those sorts of tools available in terms of homelessness and and feeding hungry people\nMost definitely you know at the at the root of homelessness is the lack of affordable housing communities across the country we're all we're all struggling to find housing that we can afford so that's kind of the basic level we really need more advocacy from folks calling your legislators\nAre they really do you actually want to hear from you and being involved in in advocacy efforts to really increases funding for affordable housing programs there's also a number\nTerm housing solutions are found so there are some encampments across the country who said and some cities have agreed to you know do things like trash pickup\nIn mail delivery services even a you know anything to to provide a higher standard of living for folks who only have the ability to live outdoors for there's not a viable option for them to be indoors at the moment so that that's definitely something that we encourage if there is more of a realization that\nAre positive things we can do little to mentally and homelessness while also supporting those individuals who are on the streets right now that's much provide all to the alternative\nWe've been speaking with Megan ... director of the national coalition for the homeless find their work on line at national homeless dot org\nThank you very much Megan hunting for joining us this week on counter spin thank you for having me [noise]\nCopyright and farmers don't often appear in the same story\nThey did last spring when agricultural machine maker John Deere argued that farmers should not be able to independently access the operating software and their tractors for example because they don't own that part they just license it\nOr as our guest put it old McDonald has a tractor but he owns a massive barn ornament because the manufacturer hold the rights to the programming that makes it run\nKind of wanes is cofounder and CEO of eyes fix it the on line repair community and parts retailer we asked him to explain the right to repair and the argument that John Deere and others are trying to make\nWhat's happening is that they don't want to control everything that happened the life cycle of the product with farm equipment in particular the data that the equipment collectors actually worth a lot of ...\nIf you need to get parents you know the ... year dealership rather than doing our very yourself\nThe way that they're doing is they're saying hey ah it it might be attractive but it has a computer in it and we own the software on the computer and you have any employees a license to operate the software on the tractor but you don't actually owned the software that's on the tractor and that's the part that I really disagree with him on I think that if you bought a tractor yours needs to be able to do what you want with it\nAnd they're claiming it's a violation of copyright somehow or at least that was their initial argument now they maybe have tweaked that with this licensing agreement with tiny print but a lot of these companies are saying that this is an issue of copyright\nWhere there's a few different ways that they go at it one is back in Nineteen Ninety eight when we adopted the copyright act and pass the digital millennium copyright after the DMCA they put a clause in it that said that it was illegal\nTo circumvent a technological walk and that was originally designed to prevent people from pirating DVDs so they put walks or encryption\nOn the DVDs to make it hard for people to copy them and they want to make it illegal to break that walk and what's happened since then as the kind of walks to put on DVDs now or in tractors and in our cell phones and all kinds of other products that we have\nMay have made the argument haven't they that somehow locking people out well it prevents harms if they try to repair or something and they get injured but then there's also a line that somehow it spurs innovation in technology does that make any sense [laughter]\nNo it doesn't make any sense at all and that's this kind of a bogus claim that they'll make it really just comes down to monopoly control of the after market they want to make as much money as they can on service and they want to make sure that the data is streaming back to them\nIf you talk to farmers that's really been that show with the older equipment farmers are absolutely able to maintain it themselves is really only the new equipment and these are fairly sophisticated machines on backing tractors would touch screen at one point one of the arguments for John Deere said was that\nThey didn't want people to be able to modify the software and the tractors\nTechnically might be possible like there's a whole boiling computer on the tractors so you might be able to install torrent or something and do that but clearly that's not the real reason they're trying to walk down their cook\nAs that sounds like a real bank shot well uh it it sounds like Monsanto patenting seeds and then telling farmers they can't save them year to year you know because the technology of the seed belongs to Monsanto is this sort of thing that you think well this is\nToo crazy to actually be happening you know um and yet here it is and in your work you make a number of interesting points one of which is what about when the company then just decides they don't want to repair that re device anymore or they don't want to make the parts for that anymore\nThey can absolutely just decide repair isn't an option anymore and that's something that we've seen folks like apple and Samsung do you it's very hard to get the screen on a Samsung phone sex because Samsung just won't sell repair parts\nWhen we see this over and over again where manufacturing low walk down the after ... there's a problem with the ice on seven right now if you break the home button on the ice on seven\nThere is no way to fix it because repairing it requires a special calibration machine only apple and they refuse to sell us after my repair shops\nAnd it really as you say it really is criminalizing repair which seems like such a strange kind of value to be pushing but I just would underscore for folks who think\n\n\n[noise] [noise]

Americans so and he's that sort of a ... you know the very wealthy or the very high maintenance but\nDoes the future look like a how bad can it can get if we proceed on this course\n\nOf the way things are going at the moment I think it is quite reasonable to think we're heading about four degrees centigrade warming across this century that would be awfully devastating just remember the difference between now and an ice age is about five degrees so we're talking about changes that would normally care occur\nMany of the people listened to this that children will still be alive and

that's why we have to do everything we can hold still ideally to to to send to grow the over two degrees centigrade nut daily for one point five I think that's looking very challenging so let's let's

next plane with a ... to the comprehensive test ban treaty a treaty that binds all new protesting and have means to verify that when we talking about these inspections for sampling open up the\nNorth Korean test site and that can be done just by North Korea in the United states and be vulnerable to the whims of these two leaders it has to be really we have to take this unique opportunity to make sure that these two countries joined the international treaty that exist so that they come back out in three months if things change\nCan you talk about the U.S nuclear stockpile how large is and\nIt's very big and we have still around Fifteen thousand nuclear weapons or in the world today I'm open Ninety percent belongs to Russia and the United states the U.S have about six thousand eight hundred nuclear warheads\nAnd I don't know do surround Eighteen hundreds are ready to launch within minutes I mean one nuclear weapon in hula ... killed over a hundred thousand people\nEighteen hundred of these are ready to be launched ultimately by the president himself within minutes what do you think should happen to them they need to be dismantled and and and disarmed a we have this new treaty on the prohibition on nuclear weapons which is a unique\nA development in the legal landscape or nuclear weapons and it's time for the United states and the other nine nuclear armed state to to follow the Global Trends ... ah we can no longer threaten to mass murder civilians asks away you're providing security with us so we we need to start taking\nTo uh put in a situation where we reduce our reliance take steps to disarm\nExplain what the um treaty ah on the prohibition of nuclear weapons is well this is a huge accomplishment\nAnd the sort of a radical change in the in the structure on nuclear weapons we have not had a bad no nuclear weapons before or the way we ban chemical weapons biological weapons lab mice to commission a we've had this kind of new apartheid system\nWhere different rules apply to different countries the most richest some powerful countries in the world have been allowed to have them whereas the rest of the world were not allowed to have them\nAnd we've just accepted that for seven years but this treaty changes that in a way it was adopted last year at the U.N General assembly with over one hundred and twenty come to the majority of countries in the world support this treaty\nAnd it has its own nuclear weapons for all countries it doesn't give exceptions to some countries but it looks at the weapon as a weapon based weapon indiscriminate inhumane impact will civilians they will be a violation of and also wore a we have bond biological and chemical weapon of course the slope of should we bond as well\nUm I might not be working to get this latest entered the force a by getting fifty modifications and willing to dust that it will be international and it will start to have an impact them all the new film states\nYou know we just talked about this landmark un report on climate change and the report attach nuclear power and the key climate solution um by promoting the notion that it risks nuclear weapons proliferation proliferation which costs childhood leukemia destroys natural environment\nThe authors write nuclear energy can increase the risk of proliferation have negative environmental impacts and has next effects for human health one replacing fossil fuels your thoughts [noise] well I Can't I mean we've\nThe mass murder of people are so we try to keep these two separate but of course uh the kind of changes in climate change means that we have to think about this and\nThe technology about nuclear weapons or with the spread of nuclear energy around the world is no longer involved if a country like North Korea can get nuclear weapons and one of the poorest countries in the world then and then one can do it so we have to work with the [noise]\nThe normative change it's not a matter of just constraining the technological possibility but we have to work on getting countries to not one new show\nA lot is made as President Trump's relationship with President potent of Russia what's happening when it comes to the competition around nuclear weapons I mean you have Trump I'm In August signing a seven hundred ... billion dollar military spending now\nI'm a a military spending bill it included um over Twenty one billion dollars for nuclear weapons programs including sixty five million dollars for a new submarine launched low healed nuclear weapon\nThat just the U.S [noise]\nYeah we see this trend all over the new job states this kind of a going back to the Cold War a little bit increasing the role of nuclear weapons increase coming up with new missions new\nI'm emphasizing nuclear weapons more and their security doctrines and this is very dangerous because we also have a very rapidly changing security environment it's not actually the Cold War anymore we have regional conflict we have

R. U. P. F. and ah and ah we or your alternative source if you were unaware\nUh the the the station that you're listening to has a bunch of different shows uh right now you're listening to progression of which is from six to eight and on Tuesdays at least this semester it's hosted by me Jake dragon\nAnd uh I like to call progression\nAs an artist and or this week for you guys for the next two hours we're going to be getting a little blast from the past uh and when I say pass I mean twenty Fifteen\nBecause this is a playlist that I've created today a is full of only songs that I had on my top one hundred songs but I listen to one spot to fight in twenty Fifteen so I hand picked all these songs are all my favorites I got rid of all the lame ones that are used to love to hate\nA and I I think I have a really solid two hours of music here so I'm not going to do that much talking for this show specifically just because honestly I really am looking forward to listen to all this music and I want to get through all that I can\nSo uh with that said I'm just going to go ahead and get started the first time you're going to hear today is photo shop handsome by everything everything\nAnd you're gonna find that everything everything was my favorite band or twenty Fifteen I have one of their songs sprinkled in through every three or four songs or just because how much they influenced me and how much I listen to them during twenty Fifteen and I still to this day a love listening to them\nOr they're very unique band you'll hear the the guys vocals they're very a high pitched but I think if you get past that and you kind of add that to the whole song itself I think it really complements the music I'm so just listen to that and then I'll get into some deaf punk and move on from there\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI remember when I got a high school\n\nDa da\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] beep beep beep beep\nBeep beep beep [noise]\nThe big [noise] big

drama like the drama around my ...\nAnd then there's the drama you can skip the drama that comes to not having your high school diploma or free adult education classes are deployed to the auto industry diploma or at least the drama John actors like me to you by the dollar general literacy foundation and the counsel\nI enjoyed a that little just promote by Terry Crews thank you so much for coming in to recruit a high understand that our other Mike isn't working right now so you did have to use mine for that so he won't be able to speak but again I just want to say thank you so much I really like what you do you seem like such a positive\nGo but I Do have to continue with my uh everyday show here you just\nHave you guys didn't realize that was all that was the fate of course Terry Crews isn't here why would Terry Crews be here\nIt was a PSA that I clicked I clicked on it and I played it and I watched the time count down from thirty seconds all the way down to one second and then I turned my microphone on and then I did a whole spiel and then I froze up in my voice cracked so I decided to then go ahead and explain the whole thing\nInstead of smoothly going into the music that I just played which happened to be president heartbeat by everything everything\nAnd before that you heard one of the first songs of the next two hours that you might not have liked so much maybe you loved it like I did personally and that was five ... piece by moon Hoge\nA that's literally a two guys playing two different sects of phones and one drummer the drummer looks insane but he's fantastic I've never heard such a fuller sound from three guys are making that song\nOf course there were five ... pieces in that but of course only two people played it\nA hence why it's called five ... piece\nI really enjoyed the solos and I do know I'm sure that some other people were like what is this is this even music is there like for him to this this doesn't have the one for five court progression that I'm older so used to hearing a but that's okay 'cause I'm done playing that song\nBut er yeah I already talked about everything everything I'm just gonna move along here to the next someone to play for you guys is called stoop life by stoop kids which was a band that I randomly found on Spotify discover back in twenty Fifteen\nIt was the summer before uh I went to college I Believe it might have been the school year before and high school my senior year anyway it doesn't really matter but I just randomly discovered them and then I'm like hey\nWhere is close by so that's where sometimes they have some music and I clicked on this one cafe that has live music at night\nAnd it was stupid kids I literally just found in the day before I really like them that day and then I kinda forgot about him until the next day when I saw that and it happens that they were in town literally the next day so two days after discovering stoop kids I got to see them live\n\nDiverse than commercial free you're listening to Ninety point one FM W. I. U. P. N. Indiana, Pennsylvania\nHeard that dude correct you are listening to Ninety point one W. I. UPS Pham always hit by\nCars that you're a that's the new promo aligned\nUh that I had to create for a project that I turned him and I do have a strong feeling that only half the class turned in that project\nA due to my professor not really a teaching us but we had to do for instead she just got the Simon cheat from last year's professor for this class and then posted it on D. too well because she's claiming to just say paper but really I think it's a little bit lazy no offense and it really kinda stinks because\nSince but I think you could just be a a lot easier if we were explained that in class anyways you just heard the French Open by fools or you're going to hear well actually I think that's the last song by falls unless we have a bit more time than I expected and then I'll play another one of their songs that I\nI Love so much a that was called the French Open and it's on their hands notes album before that you have heard of very unique different song that you would not expect for me probably if you knew me and that is technicolor beat by a wonder\nI Believe they have a few super popular songs not sure where a technicolor bee lands on that spectrum\nFor some reason it just like showed up on my discover weekly and twenty Fifteen when I went to college uh my first college in uh South Carolina\nI listen to that a kind of sounds sad I guess but I just really like the vocals in it I wasn't really saddened anytime during that period when I listen to it but whatever it's it's slower a it's a very nice song to listen to easy on the IRS I Would say\nAnd then before that you heard stoop life by the stupid kids which I talked about last break\nA up next we're going to start off soft with another track that I just randomly happened to find back in the day and I think it's a really beautiful song great lyrics great be not even be 'cause it's like guitars and stuff\nIt's titled bloom which is the bonus track off of the paper heights would land a pie\nAnd then after that you're going to hear another everything everything song and then who knows what'll happen after that just to get ready to sit back relax listen to some great tunes you're listening to ... point one W. I. U. P. F. M. enjoy bloom buy the paper kite\n\nYou know now without ...\nAfter that I used to complain very although you know ... strain that\nEnergy share my head you know ... ...\nAnd a leg shattered try to get it down\nTo ... do you see them ... days\nOf the stocks that can get a cat and\nThink well you\nKnow\nHow\nCan that be closed down in\nThe new\n...

[noise]\nOf weeks they won't have to sort of you but the gathering and strategic interest to be to be willing to\nAble to do is just a couple of days to go a little difficulty to this particular study the sticky staged just presented as a city that was basically ... to ... to ...\n[noise]\n[noise] schools can still go because you can spend\nThey face to face just because you prefer to be with us today because many of these days they used to be [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter] [noise] I mean even just a really interesting because you will be there and it was very differently than they were\n[noise]\nOh\nYou are locked down to your alternative source Ninety point one W. I. UPS em Indian\nFunky so that was jeez do are you guys just heard it gets funky your version four by both pack featuring none other than what we call on the drums he had the drum solo on that uh he has one of my favorite songs of the year\nUh check out his new album was released on my birthday August ten twenty eight chain\nA source and I just happened\nTo hear that for the first time as I played it I had my hand on the pause button making sure there wouldn't be any a rare curse words usually hold back doesn't do that kind of thing but wow how funky is that you guys should really watch the video I highly recommend it uh there's a lot of tapping of different keyboards\nA it's a show you got to watch the video\nBoth back is fantastic what are what are you got to say about them\nOr they got famous if you don't have the story everybody knows this story that knows both back at this point but if you don't know both back there a funk group from Michigan now they're in LA hence why they\nHad a Louis coal and they always feature some LA artist that uh is kind of in the whole world that they're living in LA right now\nUh so they got famous off of their album titled sleep a thigh\nWhere it was an album of complete silence where they asked they're small but loyal fan base to play their album sleep a five on repeat while they were sleeping because that would still count is listens towards their revenue that they would get from Spotify\nA and it actually turned out that they would get they ended up getting something like\nFour thousand dollars from it which is a lot for spot fine for an album that is just silent so that went viral and that's how I heard of them and that's why I got into them the first place spot if I took the album down I don't think they ever were sued or anything they were able to get that money that they dinner and they just had to take the album down\nThen they went in use that that few thousand dollars to fund the toward that they did across the U.S and the tickets for free\nWhich is pretty fantastic for a band to do especially that caliber they're not rookies they're they're all a skill musicians in their own part and they all come together and play music is wolf pack and no one featured Lewis\nBut uh I really didn't know what they were but I loved the guitar I loved how many different ...\nBut it turns out after some research when I first looked into them or I guess there's younger that its closest to his metal or like hard rock slash metal and it's just kind of like metal music except for no distortion and no like scream of vocals over top of it\nBut I guess I just never really thought about that and how I I don't know what kind of opened my mind up to that whole genre which I'm not a huge fan of still to this day\nBut I just was was interested that that was where the music kind of stems from a Sean I Know that they tore all the time so I'm sure there'll be around this area at some point over the next few years off you really liked him check him out this was off their grow album\nAnd then before that uh you've heard beyond like I said from ... punk\nUh another weird futuristic slashed retro steely Dan slash eagles type song uh with like a robotic vocal dude I don't know who that is singing it doesn't say maybe it's like just tapped punk in general\nBut uh I really liked that I have and listen to that so in a while it was a it was a it was refreshing to listen to that again\nSo up next we're going to have another song by everything everything and then we're going to get into a one or two rap songs and you'll hear from the bass Kendrick Lamar so stay tuned for that but for right now listen to cough cough by everything everything\n[noise] ... [noise] wait a second [laughter] so calm ... wait a second [laughter]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] you\nWant to do\nMake it to me in the bottom line\nThat lead them to you\nHe'll meow mixed load now he'll be back in their Logan Logan and they're right and like things don't get how did you ever do that I Know that I like\nThat point um didn't they didn't want to hear from Asian ... them on the immigration\nWere nobody else is going to me when I'm thinking oh\nMight be like ... patriots may find out about it here\nPeople would\n\n\n[laughter] [noise]\nI thought it was to oh I don't know I think I Would take the drawn into music store in charge them because you are and before you can actually play\nWhy make excuses you can make music\n[laughter] does anybody else singing along to that beautiful rendition of twinkle twinkle little star [laughter]\nWhy pick such a basic simple silly child so on I don't want to be learning twinkle twinkle if I just learned the guitar [laughter] at least for like smoke on the water or something [laughter]\nA\nSomething for everyone does is that you are UPS them Ninety One Indiana, Pennsylvania\n\nAgain thank you so much for that wonderful sworn legal I D O R U P I enjoy playing it and I enjoy listening to it\nAh this is Jake um your host of progression from six to eight every Tuesday for this semester maybe next semester hopefully I don't know maybe I'll change whatever doesn't matter that is not for many weeks from now you just got done listening to salad days by max demarco who I guess in twenty Fifteen I heard this song\nBecause it was pretty popular at the time\nBut I never really got into him until about a year ago and then I really do deep and there's music I Love his style I Love his static as people say\nThe which is blank don't kill my vibe a can of course I played the instrumental a version by this band called sly fifth have\nAnd I guess they make covers of popular like arm be songs but with a bunch of different instruments I really like how smooth the whole song is and it really supports I think what they were getting at with Kendrick in that song originally\nAnd uh finally you heard disciples by tame in Palo super short song he was kind of like a sneak peek to their new album\nAh I recommend you guys really dive in deep entertainment policy like that one song they have some more hard rock they have some more electronic music it's kind of a mix now uh some people really enjoy their older albums whereas mainly rock\nAnyway I just found out something crazy I don't know if you guys would be interested in knowing but it's just good to know so this person if you guys don't read it is\nIt's where there's a bunch of different places that people post about different things and this is about legal advice to people post asking for legal advice for different things\nAnd this person has this whole long story about how she thinks her boyfriend who's a doctor is dragging her to forget ... like a bunch of different things\nAnd it's really just like a an odd read kind of concerning and then the top comment turns out that ah hey can you check your mattress and see if there's any uh like brown\nA crusty is on the size of it\nAnd then she's like yeah why and it turns out a long term exposure to bed bugs causes people to go crazy so she was having all these hallucinations and for getting things are due to these bed bugs\nSo poor boyfriend being accused of that in the first place and for her for getting a long term bed bug facts but I'm sure it's fantastic to know what was going wrong and I just thought that was interest\nSo how did you guys know Nikki Haley ah dropped out of being a UN ambassador after they started investigating something about her a except in free rides on jet planes which is interesting in in and of itself but this isn't a political show I don't know\nToo much about politics but I just saw that this was just we're living in a weird world at this time and Trump was quoted saying that no one is more competent in the world than his daughter Ivanka Trump to be a the replacement for the UN ambassador\nAnd then he goes on to say but I Would be accused of nepotism if you can believe that which is just\nI don't know I'd you take that how you want to take it I just think that's a very crazy situation for a crazy time in our society\nAnd in some ways I hate it and in some ways I Love it everything is just kind of falling and just getting weird which is kinda good I think because we kind of are getting stale there as a society\nBut I don't know I just think that society has kind of been getting worse and worse since like the seventies I Would say of course there were bad things going on in the seventies and before then and after that but just in general I feel like I don't know it's just been getting we're we're weirder each year\nBut I guess it's something to talk about something for people to make news about so uh\nJust thought I'd I'd throw that out there take a break from the music for a minute but I Will get back to it with uh the song art of progress by work drugs I Know none of their other songs is is just a random discover weekly find ah that I think you guys will enjoy and then I'm going to get into a\nA bit more experimental electronic music after that so enjoy art of process or yeah or to progress worked drugs\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Indiana", "day": "09"}
