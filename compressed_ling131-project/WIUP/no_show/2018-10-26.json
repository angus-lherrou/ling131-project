C.\nAnd at first the answer seems like no way like Caesar breath could not still be around I mean a breath is about the most ephemeral thing you could think of and the size of one breath compared to the atmosphere at large just seems so minuscule that you would think no way that the ... disappeared by now\nBut if you look at it a little more closely you realize that well you know there are actually so many molecules in a single ... something like twenty five ... Kilian molecules which has a twenty five with Twenty one zeroes after it\nThat so many molecules are ... and those molecules are mostly nitrogen molecules which are very hearty very robust molecules that stick around for a very very long time\nSo the question then becomes which is going to win out the very very small number which is how big a breath as compared to the whole atmosphere or the gigantic number of molecules that have then spread across the earth from Caesar's last ...\nIf you do all the math the writing out it turns out that the answer is they cancel almost exactly and it's almost a certainty that every time\nAnd with someone who died thousands of\nYears ago I Can't help but note that that number twenty five six billion is also roughly the number of stars indivisible first so I don't know which number should impress me more in the number of stars or the number of molecules in Caesar's last breath ... to ... years twenty five six million\nA molecule severe but you know if he had ... as we would know that right because we're only getting one or two molecules are obviously that's perfectly okay yeah\nSo it's not a you know Caesar's last gas or something else like that because a lot of those molecules would have disappeared there are more reactive molecules in the air\nThan ah the nitrogen that he was asked sailing so those molecules mostly would have\nDisappeared reacted out something like that to only some of the molecules remain but\nThey do remain and really there's no reason that it's Cesar that people usually put in the problem as opposed to other people you want to mention you could mention you know Confucius or Amelia Earhart or whoever you want to pick from history their breath is still lingering still mingling in the air as well\nCan you give me some idea of how long it takes or you know if somebody kills over tomorrow before their breath some of their bread could be inhaled tomorrow in downtown Beijing\nWouldn't quite get there that quickly from someone in the United states but within a week or so it would have gotten to that point where some of the molecules would have made it all the way around the earth like that\nAnd then over a year or two we would probably spread over the northern hemisphere and within two or three years would be spread over the entire earth so it doesn't really take that long a climate scientists know pretty well how quickly Arab mixes\nIs the essence of chocolate which are the cocoa beans and part of the flavor development is created through that roasting process\nDo you get used to the smell I mean at some point does your nose adapt and you don't smell that wonderful chocolate anymore\nAs you approach the plant and smell it will always recognize it but when you're in the plant you could use to smell well thank you very much you solve this mystery for me You're welcome\nAs I leave the factory the air is perfumes with the center of roasting cocoa beans\nAnd I learned that I'm not imagine at the realm of chocolate really does feel the air\nGood slipping Molly I Hope you'll bring some of the chocolate to the studio when you come in\nNow dogs track down since routinely that's what they do they lead with their noses humans are born smugglers too but you know with the exception of the mouth watering the realm of sweets we often dismissed the odors that envelop us dogs do not smelling is how the map their world\nFor a dog the air is filled with information they have hundreds of millions more factory receptors in their snouts than we do making them serious sniffer dogs can detect traces of explosives and even certain cancers\nThey can perceive sense that we can't and we might experience more if we took a cue from them says dog ... mission researcher Alexandra Horowitz she's the author of being a dog following the dog into a world of smell\nAnd following my nose along Amsterdam avenue toward Dr Horwitz his dog cognition lab\nBarnard College I'm picking up orders of hot pretzels cut flowers Indian spice and I imagine entering the dog cognition lab and being greeted by dog smells in a row is sniffing animals first though I meet Alexandra Horowitz in her campus office [noise]\nAlexandria where in your office at Bernard but the dog cognition lab I understand is nearby but somewhere in the vicinity if I were a dog I could probably sniff it out\nOr we should maybe revise because this is really the dog cognition lab the darkness alive is anywhere where\nWe are studying dogs essentially so we do actually do some behavioral tests in this room there's tape on the floor so we are videotaping and monitoring what the dogs are doing but I also studying dog\nDogs could be the cognition lab\nOkay so it turned out the dog ... mission lab was right undermined those dogs have some of the makings of good scientists they're curious about everything they can't stop collecting data but since dogs don't submit their conclusions about what they smell to referee journals\nDr Horwitz studies they're sniffing behavior to make inferences about their cognition and what's ... they are\nDogs have now been trained detection dogs have now been trained to tell us when they notice all manner of object and\nReally most objects have a smell potentially if you have the equipment to detect it so that is everything from you know explosives detection dogs they're cancer detection dogs their dogs who can detect bedbugs of course than any other varieties many other varieties of insects\nThere are Scott detection dogs in other words dogs are being used by researchers to find the Scott and the ... of wildlife populations that they're trying to canvas but that are hard to see their diabetes detection dogs can tell when blood sugar is dropping\nSo really you could put their nose in any direction just tell them what it is that you want them to notice and they'll notice it for you dogs can detect all manner of objects as you say\nAnd how much do they need to detect any just a tiny bit and\nAnd how how load is that that concentration go right they often need only a very little bit so I think it's something on the order of a ... trillion of a gram of TNT or other explosive for an explosive detective detection dog to to notice it\nThat's at a far lower threshold that we can detect it we have decent noses\nObjects they really need that minimal amount others they might need more like a millionth of a gram much much more\nI'd like to pick up on something you said of dogs can detect cancer and I understand that they can detect a certain kinds of melanoma and you also said diabetes so I Wonder if that suggests that we are emitting something from our skin is it her skin that they're smelling\nYeah that's an interesting question we don't really know actually what it is in the cancerous cells that the dogs are noticing but they do seem to market different so then national reports of dogs who were detecting cancers were actually\nInadvertent melanoma detection dogs these were owned dogs not trained in anything who had been kind of bothering the owners\nLegs or arms and after months the owner goes to the doctor finds out um they have a melanoma in that area and because of stories like that which were published in the Lancet researchers started doing dedicated testing to see oh if you give\nA dog samples of exhaled breath can detect the ex held breath that has\nTo come from a lung cancer patient if you give them plasma from\nThe body of of an ovarian cancer patient can they learn to distinguish it from a person who doesn't have\nOvarian cancer and they can do that but what it is exactly and the samples that they're detecting is actually an open question and in fact there researchers trying to figure it out there are hundreds of odor and in those samples [noise]\nWhat's the one or the combination of them that the dog to tax people would like to know because they'd like to create an electronic knows that can find that same odor in but they they haven't done that yet\nWhich is extraordinary about the story that you told us is that the dog recognized it as a nominal is that it was not right\nAs an animal whose primary sense is something other than fish in the world must be rendered a certain way and olfaction to a dog typically and they're likely to notice a change\nIn it and so if they're person smells a certain way ordinarily and then there is a distinct change in their smell they'll probably be attuned to it\nIn fact our olfactory system works the same way in principle we noticed new smells so you come into a room that smells strongly of coffee it's if you're a coffee drinker like I Am it's life will smell\nAfter a while it disappears our nose literally adapt to it right the cells stopped firing so we stop noticing that you have to leave the room change in other words\nThe air that you're smelling and then come back into noticed that again so what the dogs are they're doing is noticing the difference and that's what an olfactory system is exactly designed to do\nDogs are very good at detecting the owners smell but if we really scrubbed ourselves down or maybe put on perfume or did something to our own sent would we succeeded masking the smell from our dogs\nI Know I don't think so there's a there's a scene in cool hand Luke where\nThe characters trying to escape from prison the ... the dog the dogs are after him and he's trying to escape any crosses rivers so that they can't catch a trail of course they can catch trail and he puts down pepper and this work to get the dogs of Israel would not work usually cover yourself and pepper the dog\nYou still smell the way you smell I think what that points out is the difference between our human understanding of how we're others smell we think of it as like a an event like oh I smell no no no no like it's a state we always smelled like we have a smell things have a smell\nThat's okay that's who you are what is interesting too\nJudgment on those smells coffee and burritos for example smelled great other things garbage do not smell good but there's not a lot of in between but you write that for a dog this is not so uh they they're not rendering the judgment there not things that they liked the smell of the things that they don't like the smell\nI think for the most part that's the case I think of an analogy to our visual system when we open our eyes and look at the room in front of us we're seeing the room it's information we're not saying up that's a good way up that's not good gray that's oh that's very curvy I don't like that there were were just\nAcknowledging it'd is the fact of the world hitting us through our eyes for the dog\nThe room is draw to voters so it's information at that same level that isn't to say they wouldn't make any qualitative distinctions\nBut we do know and in fact almost any dog owner could testify\nThat dogs are often not disgusted by the types of things we think are disgusting even if they role in it even if they role in it exactly there are lots of enrolling is presumably um and acknowledgement of held delightful they find that smells but they want themselves to be perfumes with it\nNow I Wonder if we could talk about just how it is at the dogs are able to do with dogs do and what their old factory receptors are like and you can take us inside the snout of a dog what is going on there that makes them such powerful Snickers\nBut reconsider our sense of smell is not only better than we think it is more important than we think smell plays a big role in love and even survival and we needed to fully enjoy the taste of food if you're skeptical about that here's an experiment\nA couple of jelly beans different colors they you know are they going to have different flavors\nPut one in your mouth and plug your nose at the same time now bite down on the jelly bean and with your nose ... all you should taste sweetness then release your nostrils and he will be shocked by the experience of suddenly having the flavor of licorice are lime or bubblegum or what\nWe consume but what about the role that our sense of smell plays and those other things like love and survival will\nConduct of neuro scientist ritual hers so that our sense of smell was the first since to evolve it's located in a part of the brain associated with memory and emotion so if you haven't already had the honor maybe it's time to meet your nose it's more than a resting place where your\nGlasses we sometimes read a reference to the extraordinary ability of super smugglers who conduct voter tests and pick out the electable foods should we envied them\nSuper smell or is as far as I Know don't exist there are people who are quote unquote noses and that some people who are in the perfume industry primarily who are very good smell ers and mainly because they had been trained and also because they're paying exceptional attention to what they are smelling and the more attention we pay the more we can actually\nSmell because the more of our brain is being used but the other thing is that we all in fact have a unique nose when it comes to the receptors that are expressed\nWhich means that for some people specific odor as compounds are going to smell somewhat stronger because of the fact they may have more of a specific kind of receptor that's sensitive to those compounds\nAnd for others that's going to smell weaker there's different ones for each person so there may be people who are super smugglers of a specific kind of chemical if that is even true but it isn't the case that there are super smell or is the way they are super tasters and super tasters or something different\nWhat kind of super taster taste with the you know I as a non super taster can't\nWell you may actually be a super taster so super tasters taste everything more that is to say they get more sweetness and more salty nothing more bitterness especially and sour and it's from the taste that they perceive they also get more ... when they're eating something fatty or\nYou know less like ice cream and more spicy and that's when they're eating hot pepper now what a super taster has is actually more\nOr non taster and super tasters have the most taste buds tasters are like in between there's or the Goldilocks version and the non tasters have the U.S\nLet's get back to our sense of smell then our our nose is actually pretty good at smelling a apparently we shouldn't so our noses or you're too central we know it's a central ... mood and to enjoy the roses but you also have written that it's essential for relationships\nWhat we've found and other people have as well is that it's especially essential for women in terms of relationships so in terms of the century feature that women find the most attractive and which is most important for them in terms of\nSelecting a lover is actually how a man smells because she can only have a certain number of children in her life span and it's actually not that many so she wants to make sure that the children that she does have are going to survive and thrive\nAnd the most important thing for that is health\nAnd it turns out that body odor is the external representation of the genes of your immune system\nAnd so the smell of somebody is actually in an indication of their immune system and the smells from men that women find most attractive are indicative of the fact that their immune systems are actually complementary and that they're likely to having a child who is most healthy is there\nSo what about pheromones everybody hears about pheromones I mean the women selective males according to what you said here on the basis of how they smell is that pheromones are pheromones telling us anything do they exist\nDo not exist in humans pheromones are a form of chemical communication they were first discovered in the social insects like ants and termites\nThey are also exist and primates from the point of view of being able to give cues for reproductive status but in humans there's actually no evidence for any kind of fair amount of communication smells on the other hand are something that we noticed between each other and we can become attracted to\nHave a dramatic impact on attraction but not pheromones there is no such thing as pheromones per say\nWell wait a minute you say that the you know if somebody I made is wearing perfume or if I'm wearing after shave obviously that can overwhelm the body odor that was the original idea of these products right thing and it sounds like a blatant attempt to cheat Mother Nature but you're suggesting that it might even work\nYes as a matter of fact we have evidence has worked for women in particular that when a man smells really good regardless of whether it's because he is just walked out of the shower sparkling clean it doesn't have anything on or including cologne or if he's wearing her favorite cologne then she's going to find him attractive\nReally okay now your new research suggests Rachel that our ability to smell a very used to over the course of the day you can do for example we don't smoke you know very well I I don't mean how we smell but our ability to smell when we're asleep is those are smell diminished for a reason\nOf all there's two findings that we have one is that you well you are asleep you actually cannot smell so that is to say that if there was a fire going on you know the smoke and so forth you would not be able to perceive it if you were in deep sleep or and dreaming sleep\nOur second finding how to do with their circadian phase effect which is that in the circadian phase that would roughly a map on two o'clock time of let's say between two AM and ten am our sense of smell is is diminished and so the question is why would that be the case\nOne of the reasons maybe why is that if we're sleeping during that time it doesn't need to be turned on to the same extent because most likely we're awake during the other period of time and that's when our sense of smell is actually at its peak it seems to be at its peak in fact at about nine in the evening on average\nAnd that may have significance from the point of view of\nBeing able to get the most bang for our buck from the evening meal because from the point of view of sort of the anthropology of food it's\nMuch food it's if you can get more flavor from smell you're going to become more say she ate it and the other thing actually relates back to sexual behavior and that mammals I'm often made at night and from the point of view of smell being very important for finding the best mate that may be also white\nSo in other words wake up and smell the coffee is an ISIS that sounds doesn't actually have um we don't wake up because we smell the coffee we wake up and until we smell the coffee that sounds like an interesting distinction\nYes that's exactly true and sometimes that could be that you have we have what's called micro awakenings throughout the night so we can wake up very very briefly and if somebody has a brewing a pot of delicious copyright beside you and you notice that then that can wake you up further and it can feel as though the coffee woke you up but actually you're already awake\nWhat about the necessity of smell from the standpoint of our survival heart evolution\nHow important new smell I mean everybody understands that\nVision is very important you can see predators you don't miss grabbing that next branch a you know sound is good because you can hear things that you can see\nBut you know being able to tell whether my socks need washing or not I mean how does sound or smell help a a survivor perhaps more importantly how did smell help our ancestors survive\nOur primate relatives depend on smell much more than we do for all the basics of survival for finding mates for finding food for detecting creditors and so forth\nBut um we certainly you smell from the point of view of the color our of our existence so smell really gives the backdrop of our existence so especially from an emotional perspective it also is most linked to memories compared to any of our other senses and invokes the most vivid and emotionally involving memories\nSo our sense of smell is I think\nConnected very deeply to the basic emotional aspects of survival\nSo from the point of view of detecting predators and whether or not you need to avoid them\nSmell indicates that meat is rotted and you shouldn't eat at that's highly significant for survival and certainly knowing that the smell of certain burning substances indicates real danger is also extremely important to survival\nSome smells are revolting presumably there's a reason for that\nWell again I'm going to have to say that there are no such things as innately revolting smells except for smells that may also field burning at the same time but you have to know that that smell actually is indicative of a dead body or someone who's just throw it up or whatever the case may be in order to\nDecide that that's disgusting it isn't the case that were born knowing that in fact infant show completely different and sometimes totally opposite responses to smells that adults in the same culture find disgusting so it's actually a learned response to find something disgusting or to find something lovely\nOkay so the fact that some people like the smell of say toasted coconut and others don't duck to learn responds yes\n\nThis is Ninety point one W.

Indiana\nAnd now ... ... ... and the time [noise]\nInto the friday edition of sports talk live are hosting the line to junior\nJoined by Jason ... and Jeff part how are we see on the table is guys it's friday we are back on air for sports talk I Am feeling great\nIt is friday I'm excited we got Saturday football coming up I mean we got a great weekend lined up fantastic weekend and we got a fantastic show as we have the best ... class from each sport we are also going to have if you can start in ...\nAre ever going to be talking a little bit about the Jimmy butler situation or I'm going to give you an update on European soccer the world series and I UP football so let's start off we have the best Dr classroom each sport who would like to go first\nOkay fall a\nLot for notice for listeners out there who are wondering yeah so um I chose to do the NHL Draft of two thousand and three as my best 'cause I took I took and it shocked at the shore and stick a little bit but\nI don't know I saw a lot about hockey but she doesn't three so\nAh just one big that just to start off every first from pick that was drafted Indiana job that you played at least one game in the NHL quite impressive to say the least uh and it shows very hardly playing especially when they're drafting\nA really just young kids you're dropping Seventeen Eighteen year olds constantly every year\nAnd I I thought that was probably the most the biggest that I saw a and then the ... the three at least played players from there were a had two games twenty games and a hundred Ninety two games just to show how well stacked that first round was\nWe also have the top three picks arguably the best goalie of our generation was picked in this draft Marc Andre Fleury\nSeven hundred and thirty seven regular season games for a hundred and four wins forty eight shut out in the playoffs one hundred and thirty five playoff games Seventy five wins mind you he was also a three time Stanley Cup champs and a three time all star\nHundred and twenty two points and stay in the winter of two thousand five two thousand six five time all star\nHorror and was the third pick arguably the worst pick probably are out of all of them he had only six hundred and twenty seven games for a hundred and Twenty one points Stanley Cup and she doesn't tend to ... eleven\nAnd then we also have a couple of non first from picks that were very successful just name one Sean wherever when the better defensive players in the NHL today\nAnd here's a great stat I found out of the two hundred and Ninety two players picked nine rounds on the edge draft\nOne hundred and thirty played in the NHL making it forty four point three percent of the players played at least one game in the NHL again very impressive especially when you have nine rounds and you ... like I said you're dropping younger players and yeah just fantastic\nAnd the average gains played by the draft was three hundred and fifty two games so that is my best draft as far as the NHL goes on let's go on a\nGood one definitely I mean all the metrics that you put into it as far as ... as you were definitely hit the nail on the head with that one\nYeah I Try not to I Try and look at a trap class as when you're considering the best trap class you have to look at the overall picture of things not just what happened with the first couple of picks up the first couple picks just because they're well known and it just an overall great draft so yeah\nWell I guess I'll go next I think just a little bit better than mine so that could save the best for last I'm Audie welcome man uh so what I did was I took the multi as I always said and I know last week I was a very a little bit ...\nLet's try to be legitimate this week [laughter] so what I did well they\nHold on so I read the clicker those were packed with a Nineteen eighty five baseball draft class first overall pick what are the first three of our picks for a little bit um\nLittle bit on usually yeah little iffy but as we progress we saw a lot of hall of famers and I think this is the one that the one drop class that was for future of future hall famers [noise]\n... not too bad ... batting average of two eighty two um you know it was our rights he hopped from team to team a lot um\nAnd then we go down a little bit the fourth or will pick Barry Larkin on the ballot for the past few years for hall of fame [noise]\nUm I I'm not sure if he was inducted already or not but still he's bumps in great numbers um he has he won the rookie of the year back in eighty six um two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve all started parents has\nFour or five MVPs and I think he's won at least five or six gold glove the shortstop and that's what keeps going down Barry Bonds right after him at number six we all know him no description needed for that\nUm despite all the controversy still great players even before the whole ... thing he was still a great players pirates um Raphael ... number twenty two who's trying to make a comeback in his fifties and play in the end all be\nUm Raphael he he did hop around team to team you want from Chicago to taxes to Baltimore and then the taxes again Texas spent the grunt of his career with 'em but nothing nothing to front about him you know you look at a total batting average she hit two eighty eight I'm On base protests\nPays to reach six hundred which is great especially for someone over fifty years old\nOne thing that really surprised me Randy Johnson the big unit not taken until the second round that that is huge for his velocity his control the ball and how far he can go into a game\nTo be taking the second round that's amazing I thought he'd be taken within the top ten when investors of our generation exactly and then another hidden talent in the fourth round David Justice no one really talks about him a lot but here's the thing\nFor what he was worse than the M O be to be taken in the fourth round but something really questionable let's take a look here he's had three hundred and five career home runs\nHe's won MVP four times with different leagues he's run he's actually one rookie of the year in back in Nineteen Ninety and he's had made three all start parents is in roughly about twelve years of of being in a game that's amazing and I and I consider that\nI can do the amazing it'll be taking the fourth round that the hidden town right there so definitely Nineteen eighty five great at one of the greatest draft classes of ... of all time to me the greatest\nSalt the choice is definitely especially when you have someone like Barry Bonds drive that six around then you have someone like the big unit [noise]\nLike I said one of the best pitchers of our generation especially with that will be there so many great actually consider how large the M. O. V. draft is it's hard to narrow it down to just one yes tongue you guys before that's probably the ... just because there's so many rounds and\nYou're dropped employers in like tenth eleventh round you don't even know if they're going to sign for you can be drafted three times once out of high school and twice out of college or just an overall I think that hobby draft is probably the hardest as first talent goes to draft and I think I think\nFor my greatest draft class I had the NBA now for anyone who knows the NBA anyone our generation will say oh of course you have to choose a two thousand three draft because you know LeBron James Dwayne wade Carmelo Anthony Chris Bosh had a lot of great guys\nOne of the I think top three franchise wide receivers for the Steelers other than Lynn Swann and don't taste all wear vest block John ... ever exactly locking was regained that his smile just infectious [laughter] ...\nWhat was that he has a he had a bunch of dirty plays in his career player doesn't who player does apart on what fun is perfect in the hall of fame that's going to bring that brings out the window chicken head and then my hassle back not really a huge names but I ... it's a notable name he was drafted number one hundred eighty seventh overall\nAgain he was a franchise quarterback for the sea hawks led him to a Super Bowl appearance\nWhich yeah they lost the Steelers sadly Anaheim towards deal here so I kind of ties in a little bit commentator for ESPN\nI I think so I Know yeah yeah you brought that up and that's another reason why you know bottom but he I don't think hassle back should have waited that long the ... to be drafted but yeah that's my costs Ninety eight okay solid class that I thought I Want to just alterations I remember ... very very vividly\nJust his dominant years of Pittsburgh and then heading over to the New York jets\nFor to remain are part of his career and he just like you knew that once he entered the game that he was going to be game changer he was a brick wall and it really was one of the best guards I think of all time\nRight okay so I'm going to go with the two thousand and seven NFL Draft\nFollowed a besides the first overall pick which was probably one of the biggest busts of all time in ... [laughter] oh he was boss he was a bus but they used to be honest he with\nYeah he was just terrible altogether but second second overall Calvin Johnson ... a mega Tron that's nickname of all in all sports\nOne of the best wide receivers of all time too bad he decided to call it quits very early\nOtherwise he probably would have been one of the best of all time well he daily injury right very common occurrence in lines players on terrible lines teams absolutely understood the same thing I I honestly think despite Matt Stafford has it has great abilities that's fantastic without a doubt he's one of the most underrated quarterback fulltime Calvin Johnson help both to boost his\nPlayers to ... ... especially when you have\nThe most yards and single season with one thousand nine hundred and sixty four receiving the artist that is just ... just as thirty six more years oh I Know well this was that that brings me to another player a pie Adrian Peterson just a couple of yard short I was I was watching that game\nI was really hoping there is going to break the record from Eric Dickerson if I Believe\nI Believe that there yeah there there was a three are short three are short very disappointing ... just dominate all season long whoever had him and fantasy if they didn't win their early their team must have been really bad but\nThey both have the same season I Believe they were both chasing record but third overall pick Joe Thomas when the best ... ever and when are you have to put up with the brown for ten years with the teams that he was on\nHe he's going to be a ... I think no doubt he should be in the hall of fame and we also make here Jeff class the draft class of abuse great players yes yes yes I'm actually glad you said that was three players are absolutely abuses in the ... Thomas Thomas is a force coming out of Wisconsin\nIn his first year sadly is like bigger Mayfield the browns\nBut moving all we got we got to number fourteen and possibly one of my favorite players of all time ... are you really want the best corners of all time ... really\nReally I'm for how bad the jets were throughout most of his career\nReally has done a fantastic job just covering the number one writer wide receiver and taking them out of the game every single time very few times that he had a wide receiver go over a hundred yards and yes rears island no getting past it yeah when you have an eye he really in created the\nWhole idea of being on an island [noise]\nBut you also have a ... Lynch drafted by the bill's most people who don't remember him you know him being drafted by the bills but really a dominant force coming our cow\nAnd I think he's got a very productive career besides those few years that I mean towards the end of his career at Seattle didn't really injury prone and very ... to do with it\nBut then you also have players like Joe Stanley fantastic player then you have ... one of the best safety is still in the game today you have ... another great ... and yet again another great ...\nSo overall I in the draft they had thirty seven players goes to the pro ball and altogether had a hundred and one ... and thirty three first all pro collections and that draft\nI'm surprised you mentioned ten again I'm really surprised he's not listen he's not the biggest factor in office but he's a great utility wide receiver yeah he is ... ... I think he was dropped a little high but I think my problem is using\nTed getting the same kind of play there are no you can use them on often but they're not really and another ... that was in that trap was Jacoby joins which I kind of put them in the same category as had gained\nAs a fantastic return or no doubt but at looking at overall picture of a drive cars just fantastic players Greg Olson grilling for the panther one of the best Panthers titans to come out of 'em were uh Miami, Florida you know\nHe was drafted number thirty one overall you can't really skip that that was that was me he was taken after Brady Quinn and Dwayne bow\nLet's think about that for a second these two players really didn't do much in their time break when did absolutely nothing granted he was on the Cleveland Browns\nBut Dwayne both with one hit wonder if the Kansas City chiefs didn't do much after that Greg Lawson is still utilize today highly like he was acting day oh it's just the latest you looked up and down that Dr ... it's just an incredible draft class I had I had to pick it\nBack I'm really happy that but\nMoving all we got our category where you have to pick one coach and one player to start out our NFL franchise\nWho would like to go first can we can we clarify the rules real quick here you can you have to take the player and coach as they are you cannot say in their prime or on a specific team you have to take it is right now\nYes so who would like to go [noise] I'm\nI'm thirty nine and ... All right so for my player I chose easily the most overlooked wide receiver in the game today the laundry hockey and\nI think he is the best wide receiver I don't I I Love Antonio Brown but the Andre Hopkins had to be physical ability as well as the talent he is one of the best catchers and the game right now he has the hands of\nWe saw a couple of weeks ago he had that double spin to help ... at the help Houston when the game last night he had one of the best catches that didn't really count that I have ever seen if anyone is seeing the replay he catches the one hand and then puts it in between his legs he's had three one thousand yard seasons he's a good team may and here's my biggest thing he's great without a great quarterback\nHe just got to Sean Watson who\nI'm not saying is great but he's ... he's definitely at least serviceable at this point I'm not ready to hop on the you know the bandwagon for walks and yet he's still getting over his injury and plus I think though Ryan has done a poor job keeping them healthy but he's proven to me that he can be late without a quarterback\nSo as far as the player goes I think that's necessary and he's still young he's only twenty six so you're still going to get another six seven years of great production out of him as long as he stays healthy and nothing else happens\nWith my coach like in a very polarizing when Pete Carroll ooh that's nice to Super Bowl appearances even with the loss of the legion of boom there still competitive this year I mean even with all those guys on there still a competitive team\nHe's great at drafting all coach at USC yeah great great callers I besides all the problems that we're facing towards the end I Know that we're just going out of corruption in college sports actually but do not face not [laughter]\nWe'll get back to that later in the show ID football tune in to a he's a defensive genius I mean he's arrogant but you know I'll take that I mean he knows how to win I don't like the girl is a person but as far as current coaches right now in the NFL\nEast ruining me knows how to put together a defense he's great at drafting 'cause when you look at the guy's huge drafted he's done a great job I mean\nRussell Wilson I'm Richard Sherman I mean just the amount of great guys on that defense that he has drafted on his own and different players he knows what he's doing and the one thing he never really had on his team isn't only wide receiver I think bald ones\nSo so [noise] ... well\nLet's get the ... and all the reverse of my head coach I'm going to go to Mike Zimmer from Minnesota Vikings he is doing real well with what he's given he has a solid offensive unit that puts up points every week and but as defense of side is a little lackluster now but the ...\nJames Harden and Jimmy ... next you have a solid three men three out of five men starting rotation if not rotate 'em in you have a lot of potential with this\nFor first pets\nOkay so the ... the beginning the first time picks right\nYes I met both teams I think they're both ... I think the temperature stupid for wanting more and I think the rockets are stupid for offering that much I'll take Lou outings contract for a ... for the first yeah I'm Sorry Gordon is okay same ... and they both have terrible contracts and they're both ... like\nThe rockets they aren't once they projected at the beginning the season I've been up here to have a better year than most\nI think they were protected the either flat line or be slightly worse than I should still be like a sixty plus one team they were still projected to be a top team this year\nOkay well why don't you add a catalyst to that on top of the two cattle you have a more romantic to it you got Jimmy Butler and yeah I Know you say he's getting up there in age and that could be the ones deciding factor as to why they're not accepting the trade use them for as long as you can 'cause if they can use this for some picks for eight years\nJimmy bowl or maybe a little play to provide those eight years\nWhen you're sacrificing your team future the rockets rocket you're given up for for ... for a player I hold on to them because that cause your phone you're basically saying we're going after championship this year and maybe next year and then the next six to eight years or just done because we have no future we have to rely\nYou're like wow you've given that much and then you're looking at the temperatures like why are you being greedy and why you're not taking this\nIt's I think it's a deal it could go either way but it would be stupid to reject the trade absolutely I completely agree or any anything else that we have to add to that\nPart of the uh super team thing I think Golden State just has teams just they they it's the only way to compete is just adding another all started when and\nIt's just a lead we're in right now I think that I really think that the teams that are saving their picks and are\nNot really going out there for that huge player I think they're the ones that are really winning and the situation yeah you might suck for a couple of years but when you can collect\nTop three picks year after year we've seen in all sports I guess that they're the Sixers I mean that's what they did for years they were bad for a while after they lost on average in and look at what they are now after a while and beat them ... and if you can step up its game are Cal falls so\nYou're right it even in that sport you have that I I completely agree with you\nBut moving on we are I'm going to give you a quick update on what's going on and European soccer we had some great champions league action this ... this past week\nAnd really nervous a quite a bit of surprises especially now that the standings are we're halfway through the group stage and there are like I said there are some surprises [noise]\nNot really much surprise in the first group got a group a with ... and ... Madrid at the top\nIf I ask Monica has looked absolutely dreadful this season they've already replace their coach they're singing the ... battle after compete for the last several years competing with the likes of ... on to win the ah the ... in France So really a big problem going on\nOne to replace them you've they've got rid of him ... ... ... ... for me no [laughter]\n[laughter] so [laughter] just fantastic players that they've got rid of over the course of the last couple of years and\nJust stupid altogether I think in my opinion groupie we have a bit of surprise or\nOther I wasn't I'm not really surprised some fans might be to see Tottenham hearts for sending in third place right now with only one point or fun and enter Milan are sitting at the top and\nSaddam in major ... major trouble right now as they look like they might not be able to get to the Ronald sixteen and she was\nA it ... play\nMoving all got groups see a bit of a surprise her yesterday we had ... percent about drawing quite quite an impressive to say the least ... Liverpool is sitting at the top fantastic jobs of them\nAre just working at the rest of the groups not a lot of surprises as I mean the only group that I'm really looking at as far as great is you've got this Manchester United and Valencia I Love how\n... my favorite my favorite thing that's happened this week is that Manchester United buses bus was stopped and they were going to be late so just the Marino just said screw it I'm just going to walk the half mile to the stadium and yeah he was led by security guards as he didn't want to be late\nAnd now looking forward to the weekend we have arguably the biggest story of the biggest rival of the year we have the al ... going on in Spain Barcelona and real Madrid personally\nNot done well at all the last five games not have not won in quite some time\nAnd just overall ... as a complete mess at this point the one storyline is going to be real messy is out for the first time in our classical since two thousand in seven quite amazing\nFor him but he is out with an arm injury plus with run auto not being there many people are wondering well is this going to be the same ... as we've seen before considering the two best players are not competing against each other so just a\nThing to watch out for as we head into Sunday we have an eleven Fifteen start it will be at ... Madrid\nAnd overall as far as the am Alaska it's the ... day as on Sunday as we will find out who will be making it to the playoffs and who will not\nAnd just for you people that don't follow soccer you same bowl is currently in talks with a couple of teams\nThroughout the world as signing a professional contract so that's just another huge thing that's going on and soccer world right now hold up you said you've seen boats gonna Simon soccer team yeah you saying boy has been doing a trial with\nA team in Australia I Can't remember off the top of my head but they have got he has gotten some talks with a couple of teams throughout Europe and the couples and a couple of teams around the world for a professional soccer contract\nDespite his age I'm excited to see that I Am very ah that would sell a lot I Would go see a hold off the bandwagon and also I uh I think it might be bad for him because you're going to risk injury for your Olympic debut if you joined another sport you are risking injury and he has ... he's retired from track and field oh really yeah he retired after ...\nHe hates he hates running altogether he just he just did it because he was insanely good at it\nI hate running but I'm going to go play sport were Ninety percent of it as running\nYeah he doesn't like training he can't stand training he's insanely good at it\nThough is one of the naturals at it for sure\nYeah definitely but let me saying I Want to wonder what six seven I think he is\nPlayers like that and so forth like Steve McNair is another one for the NFL he never he never worked out with the team and could throw better than most quarterbacks\nYeah so uh\nWe're we're situation going on in the world of soccer but yeah so moving all we've got some World Series to talk about first two games are done with Boston really looked to be all over the Dodgers at this point exactly what they are going to be playing tonight I Believe from\nUm yes they're starting game three tonight in LA Red Sox have the upper hand they are red hot in the world series going up to an eye on the first two games a mock start on Fox exactly and I kind of hope that I'm able to watch a little bit um if not\nThe red Sox we knew it in going into this play off around that they were a superior team\nGoing into the world series I thought they were going to crumble I did I really that even though I hate the Dodgers I thought they were gonna crumble but they've shown a something different we've seen a lot of production from both sides offense and defense ... a few force with the weather and we'll keep that's finally waking up with about\n... ... on the big hit episode I chose him as the world series MVP I said that he would rise from the dead and that he would overcome his demons well I'm ...\nOne other thing that on top of that I I think right guy 'cause if I I don't know if you guys knew delivered food to the ...\nAthletes should be because you should reach out to more than I think when you're involved in sports you should have an effect on the world not just the world of sports\nExactly you know you look at levy on bell and you you're like this isn't how an athlete should start are or how she should act and then bring 'em ... feed the homeless after game too when my question is if they would have lost what he started on it\nProbably not but hey that they want to get it that's all that matters family or for doing it the story is that he did it and hearts out hurt her to him because I was just a big congratulations on showing some professionalism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMhm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMhm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\nPercent a year\nThe ...\nThe\nStand for especially something\n\n...\n\n\nA gas ... mom buying\nNew piece [noise]\nThe world the pain or below\n\n\nSome of the main stream on the line there to do something good enough when that happens you can\nThem in a long\nLaw and da da da\nDa da da da\nDa da da da\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\n\n\n[noise] ...\nMm\nMm Mm Mm Mm\n[noise]\nOn the bottom of\nThe world the two men two and a dog eat dog she would always go to ... and you know get the mom when an job on\nMay ... ...\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa\nWhoa whoa wait a minute you say you're\nA fan and you know the ... and ... and ... and the ...\nYou know why he went to the bars and clearly and uh yeah so ... a day and where we share out the way to do that at all\nThe way the law in the\nEarly ... and his ... and\n\n... and a little baby a\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell no no no well ... ... ... ... more than ...
