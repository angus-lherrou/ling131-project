the strip and yell it's phenomenal and obviously it it seems as though it's early work but it it's gives you such deaths to the characters that you create a\nWell I [laughter] that's surprising to hear you say that because I think in the beginning I it wasn't his character driven as it became you know I was trying to create gags and and so that was that was about as as high as I was shooting in those early years as I was just trying to make people laugh\nYou drawing these characters in depth and moving them through time and moving them through the ups and downs of of lives was something I just didn't imagine in fact I went on to to grad school and graphic design because I had no idea that this thing would have any kind of legs\nAnd I'm no one was more surprised than either in the years went by and twelve of them went by and I thought you know this isn't good to keep all of these characters a on a college campus maybe soccer but the rest of them really\nReally need to really needed to move on and so I I froze the district in place and took took time off to work in the theater for a while when I came back\nMoved them forward uh in in in real time or all of them have kind of a different timelines some of the age more than others um I'm I'm I'm horribly inconsistent with that\nPart of the of the joy of doing a character driven a strip in more or less real time is is you get to write about different parts of the times of life but also you you get to write about succeeding generations\nShe became sort of front and center when she was in college and I realize that what I was doing was I started focusing strip on characters who are in the act of becoming their in their late teens early twenties and that's the most dynamic time of life that's when changes are are\nAre most profoundly a felt and later remember there's something called the reminiscent bump in psychology and Indian memory studies\nWe everybody\nHas the strongest memories from that time from from late adolescence in the early adulthood and not just because you're experiencing things for the first time\nBut I'm also because you're defining yourself when you look back at yourself at twenty five you may see a more immature version of yourself but basically you were turning into who you became so that's fascinating for someone like me to write about which is why I have three generations of of characters\nUm you know how my skin to behave in any given situation not so much with the younger characters\nWhen the last time we talked the book was huge and it was a collection of the Donald Trump cartoons that you had done over a a long period of time says as I said since the since the mid eighties\nThis book is ball Sunday strips here doing you're doing it weekly now [noise] right a few a few a few years ago I\nI started working in television kind of more intensively had been doing sort of projects along the way but\nUh I became the short run or on a on a show for Amazon and I had to step aside from the daily strip it just was a it was just overwhelming and having stepped aside um I came to appreciate that block of time that opened up to me even after the show ended\nI just didn't want to go back in the heart is a full time\nBut I Love doing it um and so I I I'm a life or I don't I don't see myself stopping the one disadvantage\nUh it's harder to tell a story um with just Sunday it's harder to have story arcs per se um there's too many things I Want to write about this is called subtitled just buried in the time of Trump's so it's not they're not all about Trump this we're actually only a handful where I where I'm actually drawing him and the White House\nIt's more about how it's how the the Trump era is landing on the culture and landing on society landing on families and individuals and how they're they're experiencing those changes in the country\nI think landing on us as a good way of putting it [noise]\nYeah I I Do think the country's kind of everywhere is kind of on having a nervous breakdown and that's not you know I think on both sides of the divide\nAnd um it's almost like we're all suffering from the TST and uh\nYou know this the recent the recent news about about the um the the bombs that are being mailed um just just heightens there's this sense of anxiety and you don't want to be drawing direct lines or to cause and effect but but certainly the the language the president has been using on the\nOn the um on the trail to to characterize a the targets of these bombs is is not helpful into an unbalanced mind\nCould make you know making a bomb seem rational\nAbout three months maybe four months after the president or President Trump was elected I think all interviewers were required to ask this question to satirists so\nIs what is already so satirical\nNature [laughter]\nWell I I think that I mean I yes I get asked that question a lot but I think what that does is misunderstand the how comedy works there's there's a hyperbole is just one tool in the cat\nAnd there are a lot of different ways in and out is that if that if that were not so there wouldn't be these huge audiences uh for for comedy late night comedy and in cartoons\nI mean as as you mentioned to me you're a earlier I'm a it's been very good for business it's very ... yeah it's very great for business it's a very good for my business it's\nTrump is is baked into their business plan of of of comedy now and I'm a ... to not address all the various issues that his administration raises\nWe'd be comedy malpractice but you don't have to exaggerate everything there is a lot of different ways in which you know which which humor works mostly you're you're working with the mechanism of surprise all jokes are ... are based on on ...\nAnd I'll just give you a very simple I'm\nA example of that just in a one liner or the last thing I Want to do was hurt you but it's on the list\nRight [noise] right [noise] it it it snaps your head because you're ... you don't you're looking one waiting and suddenly you you go you look you know that's kind of how humor works\nAnd they're they're a great many uh different approaches that I take that are in that for\nOne of which you just flip past is is I'm a classroom in which little Donny Donny Trump is being asked questions because this is something that everybody can identify with your asked a question you're in school you might still have nightmares about this you have no idea\nSo Liz I'm Donny Trump is in class the first bounces little Donny Trump gets called on and this is verbatim from a press conference in um for twelve Seventeen so this was this was\nThere was a little isn't just a press conference it was a whole world was watching the were you know all the it was during one of the uh G. seven meetings or or something like that\nSo the question asked by the reporter is being asked by the teacher a little tiny Trump's is Johnny what do you think European countries have to fear from Russia case that's a real question that was asked Trump and here's has really answer\nWell I Want us to just start by saying hopefully\nThey're going to have to fear nothing ultimately right now there are is a fear and there are problems there are certainly problems but ultimately I Hope that there won't be a fear and there won't be problems\nAnd the world can get along that would be the ideal situation it's crazy what's going on whether it's in the middle east or you look at no matter where the Ukraine you look at whatever you look at it got so many problems so many problems ultimately I Believe we're going to get rid of most of those problems and there won't be fear of anybody\nThat's the way it should be so teachers says so no clue\nIt's just we have a very big problem with North Korea thank you\nSo that's a that's from the White House transcript\nThat's our president that's not me embellishing anything that's me trained you know just putting it in a strip but but by putting in grade school contact one we can all identify with 'cause we've all been asked question here I'm sure you're going to ask me questions I have no answer to and but I'll still give you an answer\nRight you you have the again to use your word earlier that\nTo to tell them or make them off or make I'm I'm I I mean I don't know how to relax I made it up stuff for a living so [laughter]\nSo I let me ask you about it because I think this is really that was obviously one of the strip so I was going to ask you about so the the other the other here is um of course Roland be heavily junior has been a character from almost beginning\nAnd where did you talk to people in the sense of sort of get a sense of people on the road or whether\nOr not and I don't really have politics now it's all you don't want to do that what's next for you\nWell I'm as as I indicated earlier I I I Hope to do this as long as there are newspapers which is\nKind of an open question I'm either we've lost an awful lot of them and in the last Fifteen Years or so you know I'll miss that I'm a this afternoon I was discussing with a a a collie um how this we feel like we're at the tail end of a great a\nAnd ten a hundred and twenty year cultural moment in which comics played a an outsized role in popular culture I mean if you look at the twenties and thirties they were at the very top you know along with jazz and talkies\nEverybody knew what every character was doing in every strip and it was it was part of our common cultural experience that's been a long time since that's been the case but you have this this great strip little Nemo in yellow kid back at the turn of the century at one end and the book and\nCertainly encourage young cartoon as these days who who particularly if they have um artistic skills and in addition to writing skills that they did they go to Pixar I don't see it happening on the Web I don't see comic strips really taking off their\nThey seem to have you know co existed with the right technology producing mass and newspapers for this wondered this century period and um and we're on to something else and you know our children and grandchildren will figure that out\nVery sure

Republican leader Mitch McConnell tip day poorly hidden hand by saying that we're it you know up to him\nCongress after the election could be looking to address Social Security Medicare and Medicaid which he called the real drivers of the debt\nMedia were quick to report Democrats outcry but that didn't include any questioning of media's own role in laying the groundwork for claims that Social Security is a controversial or troubled program in need of addressing\nWe'll go over the myth about Social Security once more with feeling with Nancy Altman president of Social Security works board chair at the pension right center and author of among other titles the battle for Social Security firm FDR's vision to Bush's gamble\nThat's coming up but first we'll take a look back at mainstream press [noise]\nMore information about Washington Post columnist ... brazen murder at the hands of the Saudi Government comes to light\nFare analyst Adam Johnson called attention to a little acknowledged media trope\nUsed to prop up the mythology of the U.S as a noble protector of democracy and human rights despite wars of aggression spying regimes the funding and arming of right wing militias and the propping up of dictators\nAnd that's the idea that the U.S political class does bad things not because bad things served\nReport on why ... killing was unlikely to fundamentally altered the U.S Saudi relationship\nNBC News on October seventeenth explained that quote Adam Google and Middle East researcher with human rights watch said the longstanding economic and security ties with Saudi Arabia have forced us to tolerate a lot of questionable ... behavior close quote\nIt's unclear if those were ... words or those of NBC reporters but you're left with the same idea due to economic and security ties somehow out of its control the most powerful country in the world is forced to tolerate\nWhat's called questionable behavior a phrase that sweeps together the destruction of Yemen which the U.S tolerates with material support including weapons and targeting instructions the heading of dissidents the disappearing of women drivers and the brutal murder of ...\nThe theme was echoed at vox where readers learned that quote the realities of Cold War politics got us involved in a deep long term cooperation with the Saudi state that has not otherwise a natural partner for the United states close quote\nNever mind that the U.S Saudi partnership predates the Cold War by about Fifteen Years Johnson writes the idea that dictators or sectarian regimes in the Mid East aren't natural partners of the U.S is simply fiction\nIt's refreshing that some are starting to challenge the United states grotesque alliance with the ... credit monarchy but with this should come questioning of the reassuring narrative that the Saudis have corrupted played or captured in otherwise ...\nSpotted regimes despite their oppressive nature but because of it [noise] USA today's October twenty fifth front page headline read is the second amendment under fire in the west the on line headline gun rights under siege was no less dramatic before\nGoing on to explain the actual subject of the story recreational shooting on public lands in West has officials struggling to balance sport verses safety\nAnd they now are calling for expanding Social Security both Republicans are still saying we've got to save Social Security it's\nYou know it's we love it but we can't afford it and other nonsense like that which are some of them is where I think will be getting up\nTo absolutely I mean you know I was just going back to fares\nOn this and it's there's just no shortage I mean here we have NPR's Scott Simon is two thousand for\nNo one would deny that Social Security is headed for a major crisis the crash in a sense has already been done because thanks to the baby boom there are fewer Americans paying into the system so\nThat's what that's up this idea of\nWhat is ultimately of course a bowl of privatization being packaged as rescuing a system that same crisis\nExactly it's all the same rhetoric and the billionaire thundered campaign has been unsuccessful in actually cutting our cash benefits but it has been successful in a couple of ways one is that part of what Social Security is supposed to provide an addition\nTo wage replacement is a sense of peace of mind security its in its name the idea that if\nThe unimaginable happens and you become disabled and can no longer work if you die prematurely levy young children or if you're fortunate and live\nTo old age you are secure in the knowledge that you have the benefit you've earned that will provide for you and your family and that's something we've all contributed to and paid for so we've lost that\nAnd the way that we've lost that is that you ask most Americans especially younger Americans if they think Social Security will be there for them and they say no and that's\nNothing over the next Seventy five year the end of the twenty first century there would still be enough revenue coming in to pay Seventy five cents on the dollar no that's not enough we want to have a hundred percent on the dollar to the idea that the program won't be there would take an act of Congress\nWill and I think media Austin oh Mitt that idea of government choice there is a sense of well nothing's going to be done and it's like a rock rolling down the hill when of course government makes adjustments to policies all the time and could certainly do so with Social Security\nWell and on that point and this is why this election coming up is so important as you've mentioned Mitch McConnell and America reveal it they've all said they they're going after social\nSecurity Medicare and Medicaid they want to cut these programs and if they're saying this before the election they're just going to be emboldened they'll think they have a mandate after the election the flip of that is that if the Democrats take the house\nThe person who will chair the Social Security subcommittee is representative John Larson of Connecticut who was introduced an expansion bill called the Social Security Twenty one hundred act which not only expands benefits across the board has a more accurate cost of living\nAdjustment increases the special minimum but fully pays for all of it\nThrough the end of the century which is why he calls it Twenty one hundred act and he said that if\nHe gets the gamble he will hold hearings and start to push this legislation\nIn the new Congress so we will see action I think the reason Congress has not acted as if they tried to do something the American people don't want the American people overwhelmingly oppose cuts to Social Security and that's what Republicans who have control in Congress want to do which is why there's been no actually\nWhen I think it's such an important point to say that the opposite side to the right wing pushed to cut\nThat would actually be more in keeping with the founders vision of what it was all ... meant to do\nAbsolutely the wonderful part of Social Security there's a number of things one is that what makes this such a good issue for those who are on the right side of it is that the women politics\nIs also pro family wise policy we are as a nation are facing a looming retirement income crisis with the collapse of the defined benefit\nPlan stagnated wages lots of home equity and so forth\nThe one part of our retirement income systems that continues to work extremely well your Social Security what we need to do is\nBuild on what works expand Social Security and to be very clear this myth of\nOh it's going backwards it's unaffordable the question of whether to expand to cut Social Security as a matter of values we are the wealthiest nation in the world we are at the wealthiest moment in our history at this legislation that's been introduced or about a dozen bills\nThe various ways of expanding Social Security and paying for it\nThey show on quickly that if we want to extend benefits we can do so responsibly but the other side does not want to make this a question of values because the American people overwhelmingly whether you're conservative or liberal Republican Democrat\nAll genders all races everyone we all overwhelmingly agree that Social Security works we don't want to see it cut we'd like to see it expanded\nFolks may remember Paul Ryan thing that he's been dreaming about cutting Medicaid and he would standing around the Kagame college you know and it sounds like super villain talk you know you you've been in a room with these people what is the social\nVision that they have that that backs eliminating\nAn ideological view and a matter of their donors you know how much money flows to Wall Street from Social Security none but if you cut Social Security back more money would go to Wall Street more money would go in fees and that's of course\nWhat their donors want so there's only a small splinter group that opposes program but they tend to be extremely wealthy and it was because they say oversized influence so that's one but there isn't\nAn ideological opposition to the Koch brothers and people like that and that is\nAnti government they want government to do nothing you know maybe a military of that you know that sort of this idea that we don't want to pay taxes we've got our own gated community you know all of that\nIn starting in Nineteen thirty six and a Republican to a friend and who is the Republican nominee for president ran\nFor ... against Social Security he lost in a landslide there were opponents in the Nineteen fifties they lost the Eighteen sixties Nineteen seventies then something shifted now everyone loves Social Security but it's Arnold portable it's unfair to children and it's you\nKnow people are cheating or whatever it is I call it a solution in search of a problem because the the solution was always cut Social Security problems very but\nToday's Republicans do not have the courage of their convictions they won't stand up and say we don't like Social Security we think of socialism we'd like to cut it back\nThey say we love Social Security\nWe need a bipartisan solution but we're against taxes because we got to cut it\nWell I I Want to ask you a a final question about media because although you're outlining distinct differences between Democrats and Republicans right now\nI see increasingly critics calling out media for some time hiding reality in that part is ending frame you know I'm Paul Krugman and Michael he'll pick up the LA Times so it's kind of sigh died reporting that was saying\nActually it there's not a relationship between Social Security and the deficit and they make these things that are just true they put them in the mouths of Democrats and it makes it seem as though the facts of the matter are part isn't\nExactly and you know I have some sympathy\nFor the media they want to see him nonpartisan but you know if one side is saying the earth is flat and the other side of saying the earth is round I don't think it's appropriate to say well\nThese people say the earth is flat nice to be here this rap I mean there is an objective reality and in this case there is no question that the Democrats in their twenties sixteen platform which did not get covered very much\nCold for expanding Social Security not cutting it and it is the fact that it has been cussed out by the nonpartisan\nActually at the Social Security administration that the John Larson Twenty one hundred act is projected to both expanding benefits and pay them\nFully through the twenty first century so you know they might get click with the old against the younger the Democrats against the Republicans but I think it's a disservice\nFor programs like Social Security that as I say it's supposed to provide peace of mind that when you start saying well these people say it's going bankrupt to just report it because it it really does a disservice to all of that [noise]\nEnroll stereo ... morning this morning and I do apologize for the slight technical difficulties this morning\nUm I don't know really what

and in our churches and synagogues\nMosques when you think about all that is taking place across the country but one of the things\nThat people of faith recognize the fact that these challenges are written in the holy word that these things were to come and so one of the things in terms of what we find in what we see as faith leaders as community leaders is that it is our faith that really drives us beyond and what\nWe see and what we experienced to hope that we know that with people coming together and staying together that we can change\nWe have to realize and know that we ... this is not a time to turn on each other but it's a time to turn to each other\nAnd so what I've seen across the faith community talking with all kinds of faith leaders across our city and across this country is the fact that we have a a reality that we have to look at in confront and when we talk about hatred when we talk about the rhetoric that is coming from our ministry ration all these types of things\nThat we as a people if they have to rise above it and take action you know the reality is is that it it takes us as a people to recognize what is going on and then we have to go to the polls next week is going to be a very critical time\nFor our country that we need to send a message that this type of behavior this type of situation that happened in in Pittsburgh that happened in Louisville is totally unacceptable and we're going to change and the way that you change that is going to the polls and sort of thing\nOr after the attack on the synagogue in Pittsburgh said that perhaps armed guards were needed at places of worship\nOr he said similar things after the Parkland shooting that are that are armed guards or the army of teacher she he ... he suggests the mosques ability arming of teachers what's your response to this idea that may be a houses of worship should now have armed guards as a means of protecting themselves\nI don't believe that houses with say our schools need to have armed guards you know that that's not why we attend church we attend church to be able to connect with our God and to be able to realize that our faith protects us and even when challenges come against us\nOr we'd know because of the worst says no weapon well formed against this doesn't mean that the weapon want calm but it means in terms it won't prosper that it won't it won't destroy the hope and the resilience of the people in spite of what challenges that we face that's why in terms of having an armed guards\nYou have to be secure and understand the Bible teaches us to that we need to be wiser served and Syngenta was a dog\nThat means you have to be alert and awake in terms of things that could potentially happen but you also have to have a heart of compassion and love and forgiveness\nAnd so when we recognize these types of things we move forward with accident fate and hope and knowing that these things you know we'll have the possibility of existing and we're prepared in terms from a security standpoint but not from the standpoint of having the armed guards standing at the door\nI think that is it to the extreme of what we need in our country we need to talk more about how do we live in peace as opposed to living in fear and in violets\nScott out as a political represented in Kentucky on and not so far away or the races in Georgia and Florida\nGeorgia Brian Kemp withholding fifty three thousand registration forms um overwhelmingly African\nAmerican I he's the secretary of state and he's running against Stacey Abrams if she were to when you become the first African American woman governor in the country and then Andrew Gillum running for governor in Florida the president just call him a stone cold face I'm\nAt this followed a\nA K. K. K. backdoor ... won some kind of white supremacist organization backed robocall and his opponent dissent is on telling voters tone ... knocked a monkey it up\nRight after he became the Democratic candidate your thoughts in this midterm election season and then what happened this week from Kentucky to Pittsburgh to the mail bombs that were sent out\nThoughts are that we better not in Kentucky act like we're immune from what we're seeing in Georgia and Florida what we're hearing a out of the mouths of politicians in Georgia and Florida because we hear some of the same end very similar sentiment right here in Kentucky we've seen the mailers than going out a\nCall and people radicals and I'm trying to shame people and ah attack people especially women who are running for office here in Kentucky I'm so we're not immune and we're also not immune from attacks on our right to vote I serve on the committee in Frankfurt that uh\nPays attention to the elections into our constitution and even this legislative session we had a Republican lawmakers asking about how do we protect the bill but it was coded language the way in which he was asked\nAbout what we can do a future wise and taking away the right to vote so we better pay attention right here in Kentucky to what's happening\nA ride around us also have to say that we need to be mindful of the environment that we create\nWe can and this past week and a gun show happen right here in ... after the shootings at Kroger and there were Christmas ornaments that the that were being sold with Nazi symbols and images on them we are allowing that climate right here in lieu of a which is supposed to be a so called\nLiberal or progressive city and uh when we allow that we're no nowhere near liberal or\nProgressive and we also need to make sure that we are\nPassing policies that are designed to keep guns out of people's hands that should not have guns and that we are very cautious about claim that there is a a mental health disorder or that justifies hate and committing a hate crime and and that's too much of\nOf what I've been hearing these past three days about ah the shooter and having a diagnosed mental health disorder that is no excuse to kill to\nBlack people at a grocery store and that is no excuse to try to break into a black church to commit crime and it's all connected whether it's the mail bombs or the murders at the synagogue or whether it's um miss Jones mistrust dollar being killed at kroger's all connected uh it's all part of\nA system that has been created in this country over time and it's a system that we all need to work to dismantle\nWant to thank you both for being with us democratic state representative Adam Scott of Kentucky serving in the house education committee she's had sixteen became the first African American woman to serve in Kentucky state legislature in Twenty years and Reverend Vincent change chiefs of community building for the city of Louisville pastor of the ... Baptist church\nThis is democracy now when we come back we'll talk about far right violence its connection to guns white supremacist groups in this country stay with us\n\n\nAnd some of the statements that he made on his account\nSuggests that he was familiar with those debates about what people who are white supremacy in America should do the optics of different kinds of action what's going to be most effective\nUh for advancing his white supremacist beliefs again this belief in an all white country that the United states is only a country for white people that other people should be shut out or don't belong here or shouldn't be allowed to have citizenship and\nSo that you saw him on his platform interacting including interacting with other white supremacist activist I spoke to one activist who's an anti fascist from Charlottesville who says that she constantly monitors gab\nFor the harassment of white supremacists and she actually got some of these Robert Bauer posts um but they she passed them by she saw them she had screen shots of a couple of them\nBut the kind of hatred that he was spewing with silk comment on this platform that there were so many dozens and hundreds of men sharing equally extreme racist propaganda that nothing about what he had said has stood out to her\nThat this was someone who had apparently harassed her directly directly is I'm a massage ... nasty comments and then appear to go on to commit mass\nMurder at a Jewish synagogue and she said she's still wrestling with it because what he said on that platform the kind of hate that he was expressing was so common that it didn't stand out it didn't seem exceptional\nMayor do do do a speaking I'm about what happened on Saturday ah\nI think the approach that we need to be looking at is how we treat the guns which is the common denominator of every mass shooting did America out of the hands of those that are looking to express featured three murder\nSo that's there to do he also said that President Trump or should not come today to Pittsburgh that they are busy burying the dead this is President Trump right after the massacre talking about armed guards\nHad production and size of the results would have been\nThan will always are just so I suspect but they're very odd\nSome of rejection and try to jump all\nMaybe you should have been a very much difference to Georgia\nHe was able to do things on board Jewish or the will to do it here the boys were outstanding players of pollution it incredible job but as you know\nWere badly injured so that was President Trump calling for armed guards in the synagogues I'm\nLois Beckett if you could talk about this and also I mean as we're talking about this violence you have um grad Bush or in the Louisville area and Jefferson town\nI he has a numerous weapons are not clear whether he had some legally he had to hand them over because of its violent background again so often we see the links to domestic violence in their past\nBut why these men are able to have these guns course Bowers used in a are Fifteen\nThese Lincoln just to violence and and this might you might think of as a stretch but because you are\nPlead guilty to criminal assaults and why I'm bringing that up now as President Trump just last week um held a rally in Montana\nWhere he applauded a June fourth day for bodies slamming your colleague at\nThe guardian this in the midst of um uh the investigation into the murder of a ... with President Trump taking the side of the Saudi a leadership and\nNot to mention the CNN mail bombs and President Trump has not stop attacking the media all week\n\nSo one thing I Want to say that it's tremendously important in these times where um the amount of violence and the partisan intensity seems so overwhelming is that female gun owner in America is not a radical thing in this country\nMay not be ... not everyone may agree with us but in this country it is a normal thing to be a gun owner\n... millions tens of millions of Americans own guns are roughly a third of households are gone owning households um so I think it's really important not to ... indiscriminately lumped together\nA lot of different issues um but to say that there is a different a big difference between being a gun owner in America and even being someone who is skeptical of new regulations wanting to really understand\nHow much that they will help 'em and\nBeing someone who is advocating for instance violence against journalists war as thinking that it is funny or\nCute that a politician might uh physically attacked a journalist who was trying to ask him a question about health care um that it might be appropriate to a praise or to joke about\nA politician who would then went on to make false statements to the police who spoke\nJust the time that there are so many different issues and there are so overwhelming that the chaos at is is purposeful um but one thing that's really important to remember is that there is also tremendous advocacy if you're if you care\nThe issue of gun control of the students from Parkland, Florida who survived the mass shooting at their school there in February had been\nSince that time all of these months or their summer vacation now into the fall they've been traveling across the country trying to get out the vote for other young people I'm working very hard to mobilize Eighteen year old to Nineteen year olds twenty year olds to bring this new post Columbine generation but it's so frustrated with school shootings that is so frustrated with active shooter drills\nAnd trying to get them to the polls so one thing that's incredibly important to remember is that this mid term elections opponent so many issues seem to be writing is going to be a referendum on the future of gun control in America\nAnd there are many organizations that are working very hard to vote\nOut politicians that are just absolutely refuse to pass any new gun control laws and to bring in politicians to support a gun safety and some additional regulations and so this is something that uh you know even though it's not always in the headlines now there's so much going on\nAt that it you should remember the Parkland kids are out there they are fighting for this and this is an issue that they're working for at the polls that this is an issue that you care about there's still time before the election to work on getting out the vote\nTo focusing on making sure that people support that support the issues that you care about a get out to the polls low and so I think it's really important to remember in the midst of all of this incredible tension and violence and that there is real or\nAdvocacy work going on and there's collaboration is going on in the Parkland kids have collaborated with students from inner cities um students were many different backgrounds all over the country they acknowledge the fact that it's problematic that white suburban she has shootings and get more attention that everyday shootings in urban neighborhoods and the ...\nAt the same time it's incredible hatred is also a younger generation that's really working and have up there and more equitable more inclusive at debate at and to really left up the voices of young people who say that this is not acceptable at\nLos ... thank you for being with us senior reporter at the

I. U. P. F. M. uh this is the progression segment of our ah programming\nAnd I kind of took this a made up my own little child where I'm just kind of playing music of all different sorts all different types of of what kind of hitting me that current weak now uh the past week I have not listen to much music so I have a few\nA completely new fresh songs and then I kind of hand picked my favorites from previous playlists from a few years ago that kind of thing so it's going to be kind of a mixed bag today a boat you did just hear dog milk by palm\nAnd hold on by John Lennon now these two songs are both found in a social butterfly is a place called discover weekly I talk about it a lot on my show just because I think it's a fantastic a feature that a Spotify offers to all of us um but I made a playlist\nHabits don't automatically makes a huge play list of all of them\nWhen it came out but uh that I liked now so palm is probably my favorite band of this week specifically I'll have another song by them in a bit uh I really liked their style I liked their sound does so specifically is not my favorite by them I Would say\nUh the next one you're going to hear is a bit better in my opinion and then I played hold on by John Lennon\nAnd I was just kind of surprised that that was John Lennon it sounded like something that would have came out kind of this year last year that kind of time\nI could just imagine like a a hippie looking do just playing guitar and singing but like current times but I guess that's what he was doing\nBack in the day and he is one of the best I guess it songwriting and all that I don't know too many of his songs I Know like imagine of course everybody knows that but uh I don't know it was just a nice song\nUp next we have a song called my sentiment by a band name that I Am a big fan of that I've never heard of until a three days ago titled or a called the universal togetherness band\nI Love the the loving that I Love the togetherness I think that's really cool and it's a really great to be songs to check that out then we're going to kind of a twist genres there for a second like I like to do and then uh I'll talk to some more so enjoy my sentiment by the universal togetherness banned [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nDuring the day\n\n\n\nThe\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nDon't be chosen on\nYou weren't listening W. I. U. C. F. M. Indiana\nI really liked that goes to Jim cardinal not sure who that is\nAnd I have some great news to tell you all a I finally understood daylight savings time and I understand that we're going to get less uh hours of sun at night or during the winter\nAnd uh it's upsetting\nAnd I'm looking at the pros and cons of it and I don't really understand why it's a thing everybody's like oh well approved daylight savings time is that you get an extra hour sunlight\nWhen in reality you lose it during the winter why don't you just make the daylight savings time the actual time so then all year round it's light outside until like seven or eight\nI Would be fine with seven but like five or six is too early for me and it makes the winter seems so much colder and and dark because it is [noise] like who's waking up early to get to see the sunrise in the winter let's do that during the summertime\nBut uh apparently a con is that it doesn't save energy and the whole point of daylight savings time as originally was\nTo save energy because it would give us an extra hour where we wouldn't have to like turn on light bulbs and stuff but now in days in our society a we use so many like artificial stuff and like laptops and computers and phones that are\nElectricity is a really high all the time no matter if it's dark or light out\nAnd ah that's proof in uh Indiana when they decided to introduce daylight savings time in two thousand six a study about that found that the measure actually increased energy so really what are we doing to ourselves we're just making it a miserable day\nUh on November fourth for us even though we get like an extra hour asleep\nOr whatever that's about whatever that however is not going to do anything\nSo I guess I should tell you what they were called now was lonely Jones by posting animal and before that walkie talkie by palm up next we just casually have the planets are just plain Jupiter ah the bring or a close\n... you know what let's

it's a bit long but it is my favorite classical piece I think that it's pretty sensible for\nJust like the everyday listener\nOr because that's what I Am and that's what appealed to me so uh hopefully some you guys will find a new classical piece that you actually enjoy instead of hate so uh let's give how\nThe planets obese thirty two minutes to bring your piece spike still holds and then I'll
