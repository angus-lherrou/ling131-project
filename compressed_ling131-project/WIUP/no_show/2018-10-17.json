good job of giving you analysis commentary maybe even some insight into the media issues of the past week\nI'm Rick Smith end of the times union here with Dr Allen shark talking CEO Northeast Public radio Allen wonderful to see you and likewise I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure had as well with Judy Patrick of the New York press association formally entered the daily gives it and likewise course that's a whole we need to say likewise likewise\nDo you have anything to say Ira ... how was your merits of the daily Freeman in Kingston New York charmed I'm sure charmed East China sea as indeed we have a lot to talk about\nPerhaps we ought to start this week something local\nOne of the major stories on playing in the national media has originated in\nOur community not far from where we're sitting here in New York's capital region and that is of course the tragic accident of the limousine carrying Seventeen passengers a single accident\nHowever any initial thoughts panel on on how a this has gone well I'm interested in from the media point of view of how well everybody's done your papers done great stuff they've been looking and asking for\nDocumentation in terms of whether the car itself was legal whether the driver was legal and you've been getting a lot of good stuff\nWAMC the station where we're sitting today and\nIt's very interesting a whole bunch of people showed up here at the radio station they didn't have to and they went out and they went four or five different ways and\nI've encouraged them to put their step in for a radio award as I'm sure you're doing for the times union wrecked so it's interesting that this is a story that a lot of people were covering from a lot of different directions\nYou know what I found is fascinating is the intersection of local national media because I you know if you're a local radio station and local TV station or newspaper\nSometimes get annoyed when the national guys come in and kind of cherry pick your big story but this has been interesting because I have seen the national guys come in and do the ... and they do a nice job of writing a very comprehensive story but they tend to gloss over and then they walk away\nAnd it's the local news operations they give you the stats\nAnd then they give you the continuing coverage that I think the people in the local area a craving and this and\nI and I was struck by what down said about how many people have put on it and this this station put on the story and typically smaller newspapers community newspapers\nWhich are hard pressed to staff stories just routinely\nWhen the story of this magnitude occurs it's all hands on deck you yes you do have to forego other stories you might otherwise be covering but it it typically shows\nThat smaller a news operations have the ability not not necessarily the wherewithal but the ability to cover stories they flood zone and they can do stories that are award\nYou know it's an edge to the surprise even if the newsrooms and some people don't know what they're capable of doing all they really are pushed into it and it really demonstrates the capacity sometimes you have in newsrooms it's interesting to me to that in this era when we have so much\nCriticism of the media so much just trust generated a lot of it from the highest office in the land you don't hear people talking about fake news when it comes to this kind of a story same principles are going on here people are trying to get the news people are going after the reporting doing the kind of truth telling work that is\nBeing done every day at the White House but it's different when the audience bias is not present the only bias or the audience in his case is wanting to know what's going on\nAnd I wish we could have that occupying our political zone as well\nYou know when I was very interested in ... in a ... analysis of the big guys coming in the national guys coming in and the local guys now in our case because we do know this area so well\nNPR you know relied on us to have the voices\nOf the material that people were going to hear all over the country entry or doesn't like to do that they like their own guys they have their own people around but it's extraordinary that when the crush comes to crunch or you know they really do use all the local people if they have to\nThat I Do have to confess thing a little annoyed about with the national media is the tendency to pick up our reporting without attribution oh yeah you know the uh\nWhen we do we we dig out these documents that show as Alan was saying uh the violations by the limousine company and so on and then within an hour it's on ABC News of without saying the times union\nReport it [laughter] and the reality also is that once those big media outlets take over the story then when you go search the store and on Google or any of the search platforms are they take over that and and the local reporting a flush us to the bottom really really quickly\nEven when I hear something on our air that I Know he's been lifted from either your old newspaper Judy or directs his newspaper I don't like\nI don't think I think it's so easy just to do the attribution USA Today's Times Union or did he is a Schenectady exist is has said I don't see any reason not to do\nWell and you and your we do it all the time we think we've gotten kind of a strict about it at the time gene because uh\nWe've seen it apply to us so often and so we attribute things two competing media\nOne of our failures actually in this particular story the day of the accident we didn't and the accident occurred in the afternoon on a Saturday we didn't send a photographer to the scene so we had to take a screen shot from CBS sex they CBS affiliate here in the capital region that did\nDo that and of course a tribute to them when it's a visual you you have to do that\nSo we can all benefit from each other's work in a situation\nWhere I saw an example that I don't I think I have this right I'm not in the newsroom anymore but\nRex as common as Chris Churchill did an interview with a candidate for Congress from the nineteenth district and he came down to Kingston interviewed her in a local diner\nAnd I don't know if he was accompanied by a photographer had his own camera but the picture you use I subsequently saw in my former newspaper guy at a story that it had done about the same person and I was worried that there was one of her name is Diane we'll show you a third for him in a in a three way race\nAnd it is now kind of a remarkable thing to contemplate that the Trump Administration has based a lot of its foreign policy in the middle east on this alliance with Saudi Arabia which we know to be a repressive regime but this is a president who has pledged to foreign leaders to death threats in dictators\nThat you know it's your business we're not going to try to tell you what to do with your government\nSo is he then going to say the United states is not going to stand up when journalists are murdered by our occasional friends I think you're right\nHe knew where he where where Trump is as of this typing Trump is certainly not spoken out in the manner that one would expect the United states president to speak out\nIf one of its people one of its citizens and a journalist is murdered as appears to have been the case here but it would be unfair to lay this event at the feet\nThe people seems to have given license to dictators around the world to do the same and then some in their own countries and this is something that this country is supposed to be standing up for the freedom of the press\nAnd should be speaking out and more if in fact this occurred as it appears to record and Trump is as we speak is doing quite\nThe opposite that's actually profound statement which I Want to associate with myself [laughter] but young usually so\nProfound that you know when you get to be a certain age you to Europe I think the word ... ... it's it's a wonderful thing markets Sullivan is the media writer for the Washington Post longtime editor of the slow news before that and then she became the last of the public editors of the New York times\nFor which is there some attention from this panel which we have given it before that you would set up a public editor who would investigate whether the stories were fair and then the heat may get a little too hot you get rid of the position\nWell they kept it for twelve years so I think the heat was hot from the get go but I think they decided that there might be a different way to approach it is what rex we [laughter]\n... yeah or the interaction that the digital world is Ford's newspaper is such that big newspaper can hear from their readers without necessarily having one\nPer se and come on come on I ... a senior blew it you found well you know they're not alone in it and I you know ... years ago you had at night but I Do not know there but it seems to be a trend away from that and the responsibility now from my way of doing this that is the whose time has passed in search of other ways of doing you guys have such\nApologist for anything that anybody ever dies in the ... as you say it's okay I'll give you the other side shame on you or somebody asking do you know there's a little bit of crowd sourcing of criticism other pressing islands\nThat said that I win that ramp [laughter] only A L K One where the new car [laughter] so here's\nThe point about raising the name of Margaret Sullivan because we digress is that this is a very intelligent critic of press a behavior is raising the question about whether we are doing enough to cover climate change because there is this dire report that has come out from the un a governmental panel on climate change that\nSays that really we need a type of rapid response such as the world has never seen on any issue if we're going to avert disaster a disastrous levels of global warming and Margaret Sullivan point is this she said quote we need to figure out how to best make the main thing\nMatter just as the smartest minds in earth science has issued their warning the best minds in media should be giving sustained attention to how to tell this most important story in a way that will create\nYou know she is so right in fact as I was thinking about it in fact in a recent commentary I said to quote myself\nI'm you know that if this idea\nThat we put a kid in prison for robbing a candy store\nAnd we say you know impeachments should go to the highest level here is a president\nWho denies who denies climate change you mean that's not an impeachable offense wiping out the world potentially so I think she's right I think this doesn't get enough attention nobody gives it the attention it really deserves you know the the challenge is to make it interesting in something people will read it and observe\nPeople are clearly interested in whether we probably have all seen that but those stories as someone who's watched real time consumption news media those climate so we do not get the kind of engagement with readers that they should show it's on us yet\nDo it right yes but when we watch and I do and you do apparently Judy and maybe even Ira does you watch the news and you see this terrible Michael\nEighty six degrees which is not been before and that is directly attributable according to scientist a B and C to what is going on\nSo this is the time I I agree with you it's been proven that ratings were places like the weather channel and the network news increase during these storms when they want to I don't know if it's because they want to see the weather the report is going to be blown off into the ocean\nBut this would be the time when they have people's attention when they're reporting the magnitude of bishops Esther for them to have a segment saying\nHow come this is happening how come as it happening as frequently as it's happening how come it getting it's getting worse this is when you have the readers and viewers attention I appreciate your I appreciate sport on this I was profound [laughter]\nSo we will at ourselves in the back for profanity around and maybe that would encourage you to come back and joined us next week and that's the Media Project Ira fest L L in shark ...

was supported by millions of white brothers and sisters who went to the polls who continue to believe that he will be president and I'll tell you this there's a great likelihood it'll be reelected\nUnless you vote right right and even then it's going to be tough why do you think he'd be re elected\nBecause many white Americans of normalize that pathology\nThey have accepted it as the price of business now now we know that they were white brothers and sisters working class who thought he was the voice piece for them that first of all he ain't doing nothing for them this guy is not interested in poor white people are working class white people\nHe put it a bunch of billionaires in office you know as his executives as his secretaries of this that and the third he has no interest in working class white people\nHis policies of not benefited from them but what they benefit from is the kind of politics of resentment thinking that black people in Latino people get more than they deserve so Lyndon Baines Johnson said the following if you can convince the poor as white man that he was better than the richest black man you can pick his pocket he said hell if you can convince the\nThe lowest white man that he's better than the smartest black men he'll pick his pockets for you so what ... boys in Nineteen thirty five in his book black reconstruction called the psychological wages of white in this day and getting paid when no economic pay off but they're getting paid with ... and they grow let like they're trying to get your schools they're trying to get your jobs\nRight and then they turn the same thing on the black people white people this was the case and then they tell black people have Latinos coming over to get your job stopping immigration you ain't getting up what's Jose at four o'clock in the morning\nSo stop pretending that and hosts they shouldn't have to get up at four o'clock to work for two dollars an hour don't be mad at wholesale be mad at the government that turns against both of us to exploit us [noise]\n\nSo I feel like you discuss a lot of the things you just said within your book at at more length\nEmotional issues not necessarily real facts are logic like you talk about race in America you you really can't talk about it without as you you touched on quickly through uh the immigration issues happening right now that has the eyes of America on it and a lotta times it's it's it's talking about\nFear of our jobs being taken out of fear of crime is really these are things that bring out the emotion of fear and so the latest thing we've been seeing all over\nThe Internet and social media we're seeing images of crying children um families being separated at the border um basically the idea is to try and discourage illegal immigration into\nAmerica but um what ended up happening is inhumane ... you're separating families and so I Am curious for you to go even deeper right how you would critique Trump but not only Trump right also the Republicans and the Democrats as well right now they're both positioning this\nThat's right no it's it's a it's a brain waves and then it up and it is true that\nTrump to date him speaking said that who is a shame as if as if he's powerless to do anything oh how horrible this is just sad because the Democrats won't act\nAnd should they act than this in the ... this could end tomorrow no sir you have the power and authority right now to stop it because there's not a law generated by the Democrats number one\nIt's a policy it's not even a policy is a practice it's not even a public policy except Stephen Miller who's a right wing conservative who was a white nationalist in office not elected but as\nA carry over from Stephen Bannon right here and ban and came together Bannon is out the door one far worse than Bannon is still there because he of public policy chops he's been he's younger he's been at this\nJohn Kelly spoke about this in two thousand Seventeen when he was a secretary of homeland security\nSo they've been plotting and planning this for a while this is not a democratic practice because the Democrats would never\nTry to discourage immigration as you said by separating wives and husbands from their children are mothers and fathers from their children so much so that one man killed himself because he was separated from the south so we know that and then when they said oh that's not American oh it's quite American\nRight in slavery and it was done indigenous people genocide it was done [noise]\nYou know in our Second World war which some of the Japanese internment so you know ... there were they were isolated events and then collective events were there so this is the worst of America but now here we have a president who things are kind of power less than it is when he's written so many executive orders for so many ridiculous things\nWhen he could just step in and stop and yes the feckless Democrats who have not stood up against them and let's be honest the president who was in there before him didn't have a great record on immigration\nRight even though black people were celebrating Obama in progressive why people were celebrating Obama he was known as the departure and chief he was deported more people of color\nAnd Latinos and others then a whole bunch of presidents combined so let's not let's not pretend that we don't know his policies were deleterious and problematic as well and the set up\nFor this situation was certainly pre figure there however having said that we need to do more than talk about it you're right it's an emotional appeal\nTo people like we gotta we gotta stop these people from coming in our borders we gotta keep them from taking our money we got to build this wall to keep them out you ain't gonna have no better economy by building a wall then you have right now and then as a matter of fact this man this president President is writing the politic\nAnd the and the ah affect many policies that this president has benefited from so in that sense I think that we have to talk about the degree to which Republicans must stand up and speak out against what's going on because these are the Republicans like Paul Ryan finally\nFinally saying I disagree with that that's not enough this is why John Legend had a special word for him or two words\nAre on Twitter a I think a little green had a song\nThat was similar to what John Legend weeded out there so the point is that these Republicans who are pretending that they are opposed to Donald Trump have normalized him Lindsey Graham\nThe senator was against them at first calling him a horrible president and the person who had no conscious now he's in bed with them now he is cussing on CNN saying he doesn't give an S. H. sugar honey ice tea\nAbout whatever you say about him because he's going to defend this president these people are complicit this\nAnd the most vicious horrendous racist and classes of salt upon Americans that we've seen in the last ten years to be sure and an immigration in the last Twenty years and they've got to speak up\nAnd they got to do something about [noise] our\nLast question right here and it it's a little bit of a look to the future of the president and the future there is one word that is sometimes triggering but I'm going to read the question as is ... do you think millennials and young people are more colorblind\nNo now let me tell you what neither should they be first of all that's not an ideal I don't want people to be blind to my color I don't want people to transcend race just trends in what you think about my race right I'm I've been majoring in blackness for fifty nine years I Can't get no new major\n[noise]\nThe white lawyer in New York went on\nHe just mad because people speaking Spanish my God that people have a right to talk but mostly I'm all males in your diet can we say that\nYou're Berlin butterflies me I guess that's better ... that's good I never got to have good what what what would you want my kids will do this through the ...

I was almost done with and\nYeah they haven't they haven't look very good at all the last three weeks as our play by play man can attest to uh I don't even want to talk about [laughter]\nUm two factors I Want to go into before we talk about um playoff we're going to do some protections um [noise] we have um\nPaul Allen dies the Seahawks owner Josh blazers owner ... owner Microsoft cofounder too yeah that was Lance ... I'll let you go first fried name any information I was hearing about\nWell I just seen it briefly like it was all over like I think last few days and just I think he was battling some kind of cancer\nYeah he he had just died at the beginning of October I think non Hodgkin's lymphoma he had yeah he had she dealt with that and the the nineties I think it made it through it and then died within a month in recent diagnosis and this this could open up some ... some new ownership for teams because what they think as Paul Allen he had no wife he had no kids nobody to really you know\nTurn his fortune over too and I saw that he he really believed the most in his philanthropic efforts like his foundations and things like that\nThat ... that hit the state may look to sell the sea hawks and the um the Portland TrailBlazers who was the other team you on that they made it look to sell that those teams and send the prophet into those foundations and all that so this could be really interesting scenario\nYeah I'm just glad that he least for the Seahawks side of it got to see a lumbar\n... trophy before he left has got that Super Bowl ring and almost a second yeah yeah and they they definitely are\nPretty good then but it'll it'll definitely be interesting to see what happens with those two teams getting on how his state or as potential if he had it will or whatever you want to call as to what happened with all the stuff\nYeah especially with the blazers the blazers haven't been really the strongest team lately so did he did he have\nSeahawks he had a ... you had the small ownership roll with the Seattle founders in the MLS I wasn't sure how he factors in trailblazers but\nI Know another story topic that I Know maybe it will be more opinionated about this lady on bell they say he's not coming back\nYeah I don't I haven't had an opinion strong opinion bell from now it's a race where I really and I looked at that and looked at the stats author or going ahead of\nWell if you look at a side by side compare to comparison William bill and James Garner one thing is for certain we really don't need bell back I Know I've been saying this for weeks on end but the Steelers ... wants to play for money let them Jimmy Carter wants to play to play and so far\nI mean you look at them living on bell and his first six weeks of the season back last year\nUm I'm wanting to put up the same thing yeah it's about one hundred and thirty Russia's five hundred and fifty yards James Carter only has about\nOne hundred and thirty one or does it thirty one yard are rushing difference between him and he's racked up ... four hundred fifty three he's almost tied that um he has more yards per Kerry I'm\nMore touchdowns more scrimmage yards as well and surprisingly more receiving or it's not really shocked me to exactly so if you look at it was the bell bell definitely lost his bad that he was ... that he was irreplaceable\nExactly we don't we don't need bell back we can always keep James Connor I'm Jeff ... who actually doesn't on friday he said it best although the Steelers way way too long for the ... we should have traded bell back I'd say we to back when his stock was actually up\nIn ... and up for how high did is stuck ever get though I don't know that he had the same value as a ... well let's see for I'm taking in part of the suspension when he was with like ... [laughter] I I shall we start there\nI don't know 'cause really is a definite season yeah he never he never really got a good full season in he was either suspensions or injuries\nHe may have had one full season on so I don't even know if you had that\nI I agree with that I don't think he had a full season either James Caan or I think he's an ex yeah he ... I I'm I'm play yeah I'm not going to cost\nSeeing this coming but he's performed well enough even without the SAT and like you you also look at the back of Stephen really he's a fine person the battle Brittany ... they have a jail in Samuels back there he's you know where they find if living on by wants to lead that is totally up to ... yeah bell bell bet on himself and he's got you got some really crummy advice from his agent and now he's\nLike nobody's going to give him anywhere near the deal that he wants and I don't even think he's going to get the deal the Steelers offered him exactly I don't think so either he isn't going to get that\nKen [noise] now we'll move on to our player predictions even though a couple of weeks ago I don't know I Know oh it wasn't here and you probably didn't listen Jake we kinda like predicted um [noise] the divisions like who's going to be a top and who's going to be like near the bottom but I'm going to put a different spin on it we're going to go each division\nBut through two to three teams do you think are going to make the playoffs\nAnd we don't have to put in how many players how many teams have to make the playoffs which is what you guys yeah\nTeams that are in contention because we don't we're not even quite halfway yet but the playoff picture is starting to formulate itself a little bit\nYeah they are ... like ESPN Zora got stuff and a ...\nWe get we can clear two elephants out of the room the chiefs in the rams obviously playoff oh yeah there's absolutely ... might even go and feed it I don't I don't know that they have all I mean if you're asking opportunity to lose the U.S proud of hair who did the Monday show he thinks the rams are now are are really yeah they're ... what they seem in Iowa oh\nJake Taylor and I got really upset about that were like listen to the ... the rams\nThey are who they say they are I think that's a that's a good take from Brett O'Hare one lives near Green Bay too weak [noise] girls think Green Bay looked anywhere near good enough to know Aaron round they have Rogers but Rogers can't do everything on her sitting at the same record is Pittsburgh three two one I also saw\nBen Roethlisberger didn't realize he was thrown somebody yard he's on pace to break pay manager asking record yes ah the one research brokered effort which words are yeah for the for the season not for like a rare yeah ...\nThe New England and nobody else was they they look good the jets are going to fall off they'll they'll be seven and nine eight and eight there'll be okay Miami might be over five hundred I don't see them making the playoffs AFC North I think all honestly all four teams could you even the brown the browns have shown signs of life this year for the first time in a long time they're not they're not going to win the division obviously\nBut they like their normally at this point they'd already be out of it basically like a win six and seven other last year there they're doing well enough that they could there still within striking distance\nOkay you guys calorie one do you have to see if we didn't didn't touch and they have the south though I don't think they're three and three ... every Indian and I thought I really thought that the Colts just had a couple of rough weeks early and see them but they're really not a good team now wind and fire there knowing apart you know\n... or\n... yeah well I mean all three teams yeah three or four Jacksonville looked horrible I'm I just say you go hey ladies okay\nI kind of hope protections are tightened come out of that division I feel like there are two deserving teams that I really haven't I think the shot in Jacksonville in jail in ... I don't want to hear from him in the planning if they can middle class by game that I also seen that ah there's talk of I doubt it's going to happen but trading late board was during the ...\nI think even a said they need to fix something up and sees he's just he's not the quarterback of the future that he did you did well enough last year almost had well enough to make a Super Bowl but that was mostly on the kind of the defense\nThe hatred and then loses in a crushing defeat\nThere's been some weird games buffalo it's horrible but they absolutely demolished Minnesota team everybody else who broke then yeah it's a it's a weird year you know and now the bills have Derrick Anderson as their quarterback that's right\nThis money and they barely have any very camp as it is good it's\nPittsburg voters that they should ban bell 'cause they want to all this money [noise] I don't remember that but see Frasier Bulger touched on like\nYou know trading him getting rid of empty and getting something in return I think he has a\nFair point but I asked for\nI just feel like the whole bell situation is because of his non\nLike he's not he's always been injured or have been in problem that Senate he thought he was irreplaceable turns out he's not yeah he did he bent on himself and he lost I saw that from a post cars that writer and that's that's the best way to put it I think\nThat at all the stats are the route news right now in a very very obvious that he's a good\nFor him to get a deal like even the Steelers offered him for years Seventeen million you're I think they offered him he's not going to get anywhere near that help Mario nominees offer what Seventy three million guaranteed yeah that's what he's not he's not going to get that yeah\nNow is there any games you guys were wind to really talk about or\nGang some talk at this week week so take a look at that or\nOr even pass games honestly I think the Steelers and the bangles game I Know a lot of people\nThat just is the only thing is like the Steelers just have the bangles number on um yeah I Know ... and that's the Cincinnati is a good team they're gonna make playoffs this year and this completely collapse and they probably should have one on Sunday but\nYeah it's nice to have to have Antonio Brown dust Bannon ab sometimes that connection will just be sometimes as does this get you to laugh and finally we're too late but if I can actually certainly work better for those students with us here in the basement Davis hall tell you that\nI'm working with a Super Bowl forty days Palmer and the Bengals are going to be a Pittsburgh and flew off\nYeah that was odd Steelers with the succeed that year I think and then that was that was over ... that was one yeah von often broke Palmer's leg and yeah yeah that's what killed them one you forget\nMy actually found really interesting the bangles in chief Sunday Night Football that was a good flexi rarely ever see the NFL actually like games in and week seven but that was that was a good flex\nOtherwise it was the ... and I was ...\nThat is going to be like a butcher premature butchering of forty nine or almost that's how it's going to be felt\nLike there was this a good game to flex and even though the chiefs gets on the other two weeks in a row I'm sure people complain about that I'm not complaining especially when they're going up afford to buy angles there's a lot of things could happen from this game\nAnd then I got when they have a huge chip on their shoulder oh yeah it wasn't that that that game that game could set up with the potential number one seed nasty exactly and they wonder what is the youngest one that just guarantees them they bounce back last week was a flip there's a ...\nBut this was this was a good choice\nNow um was there any like isn't there like a Thursday night game or something\nOr to not as raiders forty ... Broncos cardinal yes [laughter] yeah isn't that good Thursday Night Football they try to schedule good competitive games and it just never works out you know filled patriots bears will be a\nGood one I see that's a massage Sunday at one o'clock\nDid you go see that um the last Sunday Denver and rams game it was snowing in Denver or read oh yeah\n... yeah I Know I Know but this one girl who ran for over two hundred yards in the snow the automatic pilot up yeah\nJust the wind is all we care about but um this is the same time it's like winter is coming and you're like\nOh yeah yeah the southern Denver you know they're ... you ... for Pennsylvanians\nWere like ... it should be the fall right now not even\nThough you know you know they're not ever as the seasons the same way you know I Know a lot of snow and then they'll they'll slow there it'll April\nAnd then they'll have something that I was actually very surprised though 'cause LA's not you're not used to playing in ... in these conditions but then they go to Denver take away when gray was close despite the weather conditions I mean that's still unbelievable that they're they store able to power out the Denver Broncos\nYeah the sunny LA teams beats the winter Denver Broncos I Am all high yeah an end to you have limited you have on the heights yeah the yeah the uh to the editor I forgot about that but\nThe quite word but um I don't see any really other games are really maybe cowboys Redskins might be interesting I was in\nFacing the ravens pages ... good ... that you could read that in a gated five hundred ... exactly\nWhat was that and who knows ... Jackson could actually do something that day too\nAnd with not having him pass the whole time\nThat is true he has been ah doing more than ... been around in some places are Baltimore he's been doing almost like a wild cat ... kinda like seem to have a smarter than we get him involved\nWhat I've seen an article a little bit about Joe ... wife making fun of him because of um how he was lining up to like as a receiver like you've\nGot a Flaco is her favorite is kind of stands are chilling yeah\nYeah and his wife I think was like how about you just give a little more emotion about like all of our Jacksonville and under center come on or something like that I knew something that probably crush Flaco there but at the same time\nFlak has got to think this is for the best of the team this is gonna be probably my chance to even make two Super Bowl because you're not with just\nYou've got a ring you've got to ... you could retire and you'd be happy you know\nYeah but at the same time you still want to beat say bangles steers two teams that always have your number or even\nHave he likes Cleveland it's like well I was you know yeah that ... been division rivals for years like everybody's rivals with everybody else honestly yes well ravens and steers especially the rivalry that\nSets kinda lost some of us left there just because the Bengals and feels about so many games that just to help beat the crap out of each other yeah when I used to be how fears ravens all Heinz Award Ray Lewis ... has a ... Miller all those guys\nYeah those roller [laughter] yeah back in the day is how could I forget him [laughter] yeah\n\nYeah now now you don't have now you don't have so much defence there but that's more of an off on survivor and you can add more better for like a\n\n... yeah but he's like thirty eight he's not as good he's not hacks off from ball so hard university anymore you know\n[laughter] yeah [laughter]\nAnd read and I forgot about it on a robbery oh yeah ... I\nDon't even cause there's even Brian ... to walk ones that was another\nAt all you didn't learn so yeah those are that was the holy trinity is ... really really good ... back in the early to thousands\nNow I Know you guys aren't into basketball too much\nSixers ah\nYeah I Know I've seen all of the Celtics last night a seven to one of ... yeah well and yeah yesterday was the beginning of the season opener pretty much for the most part so large teams were playing\nAnd I've seen that um butler was expected to play for the wolves even though I Know you guys might not seen but he's having disputes with the wolves the timber wolves because\nHe says that um cat is not really working hard in Andrew Wiggins is acting like a kid for the most part\nWhich I honestly we don't know behind the scenes honestly we don't know how they are we just know what is shown in the media\nAnd it's just\nKind of good but at the same time bad because it could be a lot worse than what we're seeing what it could be\nMaybe nothing to be honest it can be just Jimmy Butler making\nDrama let's put it that way\nNo thoughts on you got a basketball person I Know then why are you into than\nBaseball or football or at all [laughter] [laughter] okay then that's not a LeBron James show [laughter] yeah oh oh we're going to go there even though I don't want to go there but I had to throw that out there [laughter] well I kinda figured you'd probably or you're not wearing your Lakers had this week so now comes off no my my girlfriend has it out\nA guide her but we\nWe will go on to baseball I Know I'm Dodgers and brewers and wow Shirley last night interests\nVantage I thought Milwaukee did I thought they had a strong chance of coming out on August Jamie and I think I think it's I think it's anybody's game best to three honestly\nI mean yeah the brewers have their brewers have their purpose to get back into the world series run that's because they haven't\nI don't think that the dog the Dodgers have won one since mid eighties either they and they had one taken away from them last year from the Astor exactly yeah they'll like I said you only ended as they had a chip on their shoulder\nYeah but the brewers they are the underdog as of this whole thing I don't personally underdog fan so I'd love to see them go forward I don't think the brewers have had really good to World Series runs like rhyme around yeah Ryan Braun was bigger\nValue I was the last time I made the playoffs with brown and field or an ... plan and what what's the\nThe L C s that that's fine All right\nThat is a lot of accusations of the Astros cheating in that serious yeah the the L LA's got crushed all going in game five in the national league so I think they could very easily come away three into yeah in car sales have been putting as the dominant yes of course jaws can finally shut the whole postseason curse shock you know he hasn't topped\nWho's the AC that I said these are the ACC has like North Carolina and pet and yeah London and there are two different ... what I mean yes UCF in Internet in South Florida they're all in what used to be the Big East and do American athletic conference and he said you have ... one of these paper I Do not have ... when they would win more games\nYeah I went back there as a ... that'll\nBig East had like pet in West Virginia and I ... I could really stay Virginia Tech\nMaryland and there I think I think\n... wasn't and that I was in the end and for a hundred and eight years and then ... and yeah they yeah they went to the big ... that was that was only after paternal tried to start a mega conference with pets and that's that's part of the reason why ... Penn State in play for sixteen years is because Turner was mad at him [laughter]\nThat wouldn't be a shocker honestly because I Know there's a lot of grinding years between them and Penn State and ... and also with all you do I know there's some with Penn State I'm Sorry I'm\nGoing to be talking about federal aid doesn't like these people who don't\nI Know with um\nMy cousin was an ...\nOr something happened there plus engineers they give the crap sports show I I Know but you want to become law that are you sorry off topic but no that's that's a weird though that's pretty funny yeah it's just something weird but\nOff topic about sorry about that but I just find this about grinding years by trying to give us a pretty cool yeah yeah and I see Oklahoma and Texas are on there too ... they're they're both good teams\nI mean the big twelve Vegas one at home with me as much for your yeah now I Would stay up and ... and I [laughter] Ames, Iowa in Iowa State for the big spoiler in the big talk for a while I mean when you're Oklahoma State was really really good\nI was stretching back to twenty eleven or so I was states enough that people have a sense\nYeah ... and still up top I just I guess this change of quarterback really has gone yeah I don't say Hi honestly don't know comes in state so good for the last like six years there's they don't do anything to do anything special\nNot really a just maybe luck I guess yeah it is not really talented man in the states undefeated to that's right sixteen\nThey play them this week we're we're going for the game that was yeah that'll be big for the conference\nWell how the top two ACC teams as far as I can tell well the only reason I only to a C team the only reason Clemson was good a few years back was because of just showing Watson\nHad Watson they hadn't or even lack years and years ago Taj Boyd was a good quarterback for them and they had guys like Margaret Brian Sammy Watkins and then you have to Shaun what's in a quarterback and there was a lot of talented in the gym the Fisher and Florida State yeah house now for states jumbo Fisher skipped town and they're completely off\nMy yeah they're just die of yeah there have died because it very bad place well it's been I think it's been like two years that Florida State was actually good so when they uh James was they were good and then a couple of years\n...

aggressive foreign policy in Yemen in Egypt and Libya and so forth allied with uh the crown prince of ...\nTurks are able to prove beyond doubt that he is the one as they say who or did the

investments that the Trump Administration has made\nIn Hama been something on on the link that has a that is what may be making things or take a lot longer than they should in terms of wrapping up the criminal investigation and establishing what sorts of retribution or should be placed on the criminals behind\nWell Jamal I wanted to ask you specifically about the Turkish government's release of information it's becoming now sort of in dribs and drabs over the over the period of\nA sense cause show she entered the of ah the consulate or wanted to ask you a first why they took so long to actually go in and investigate since they knew early on apparently\nUh that that a crime had been committed a and what do you think is behind the or the or the partial releases of information over this period of time\n\nThink Turkey's foreign policy is I'm just minutes um is under a lot of stress that has been before this when you look at the war in Syria when you look at the G the crisis when you look at the courage separatists and many many other issues the usa an order then I think they are not\nConfrontation with Saudi Arabia with which although I'm papers and I live they don't really see eye to eye on several issues in the beginning it seemed that the Turks were trying to exhaust diplomatic Corey doors between them and or avenues rather between them and we all\nAre by trying to maybe get the Saudis to old enough to see what happens and therefore uh it wouldn't be seen so confrontational when that didn't happen they started leaking bit here and there are to try and maybe a gardener supports from other countries like the United states like\nA return in Germany and France in order so that it doesn't mean a so it's not framed as a Turkish Saudi spots but more so and international outrage as Saudi Arabia or have done\nMore interestingly I think the latest truly that we were able to get or the late just two bits of information and we were able to get from\nThe attorney general's office the nights that his he mentioned the concert up behind me and then later the details were the gruesome details of how to modify so she was a indeed murdered I think the timing is very important they came right officer\nInitially tried to flow to the idea that this was rogue elements\nThat were behind this and therefore I think the uh Turks wanted to just missed completely by saying well how can it be a rogue elements if indeed it ah took place in a confidence that is a a diplomatic mission under the direct order or control over the governments and secondly the details of this taking place\nWas done when Trump to try to maybe the idea that this was a somehow in a row corporation a an interrogation that went wrong the fact that you would send your head autopsy expert at the fact that as he ... a democracy will she was barely question difficult question\nI'm was in fact descended upon by these special forces officer and a beach in and killed in the way he was with uh\nDidn't really listen to the orders that they were given over the the sorts themselves how to speak here a lot just in the sense that they are the ones who calls this rift will follow the circus economy has been suffering quite a bit recently uh they've been trying to maybe make amends or a ... relationship with\nWashington and we've seen ... and ... and these were the comments come and go to the Trump Administration following the release of\nThe ... or so like I say this is a case to go up to do much more we've geopolitics um ah the interests of power groups than it is about unfortunately just the the the case of freedom of expression and a journalist has been or something like this\nOn your friends with a gym ... brother is that right you just saw him can you talk about how his family is responding right now what they're demanding\nYou have President Trump it seems even before the Saudi regime has publicly floated that there were rogue elements who did this so they did this it hasn't been explained how they did this in the Saudi consulate or the Saudi consul general's residence\nI'm a you have Trump himself as saying this was rogue elements possibly and you have\nA ... who is now gone to turkey where you are a by going to Saudi Arabia yesterday many question why wouldn't they be calling in the Saudi ambassador in Washington why would he be going directly to Riyadh\nAnd taking smiling pictures with both the um\nKing as well as the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman how is the family responding to all of this and explain who just tune Janelle ... she is and was this is not a lead dissident within the Saudi regime\nUh-huh\nPeace was very good friends with my brother I had met a ... on several occasions or as a journalist indifference conferences in conventions and symposiums but I Do not know Jamal casualties brother um it is my brother who was very good friends with\nA ... and they work together as a sense of ... and I had a Mets tomatoes I mentioned uh on different occasions I Am aware\nThat's one of ... sons its currency actually in the United states\nI'm also aware that's one of his other suns AA has been under a century house arrest in Saudi Arabia for many months I'm On the other side you authorities I put a travel ban on him\nA ... in a way to try and force managed to come back\nUm it does seem that there is a lot of pressure that is has been put on a his family one of his sons are in the United states has recently created that Twitter accounts which he released through its um a statesman a where he's the bonding full transparency is what happens\nTo his father you can only imagine I'll be seeing a situation like this um\nWhat kind of told could take I mean\nNot only do suffer the loss but you're suffering the everyday I getting of not knowing or not having closer\nNot being able to very you know being able to uh pay respects or through\nPraise from a from a religious a perspective and to ensure that that that person is resting and these obviously that would have a lot of stress and it goes to show and it speaks volumes of the Saudi authorities would maintain a travel ban on his son\n[noise] Mm\nI'm human gene\nMm you know\nThe mood ink and ... you know they're ...\n... ... ...\nUsually you Mm\nMm view food Mm ...\nMm\nImagine you would have been ...\nAnd ...\n\n\nAnd John Prine here on democracy now I'm any good and with Juan Gonzales\nContinue our discussion on ... gruesome details are emerging the disappearance of probable death of the Saudi journalist and washing the bulls columns who was reportedly still alive when his body was dismembered inside the consulate ... more than two weeks ago\nOr a Turkish sources it took him seven minutes to a New York times reports for the fifteenth Saudi men implicated in the killing or directly linked to crown prince Mohammed bin ... security detail\nFor more we're joined here in New York by ... investigative reporter who's been reporting from Saudi Arabia with the Policy Center for crisis reporting her latest piece for the intercept headlined ... she wasn't the first Saudi Arabia has been going after dissidents abroad for decades um it's great to have you with us Sarah\nI'm we were just speaking with ... a shy out if you can add to what he was saying what you think it's important for people to understand at this point many wondering why\nPresident Trump is doing PR work for the Saudi regime or even before they say publicly he says maybe it's rogue elements when we're talking about an official government building in Saudi Arabia I mean in a\nTurkey the Saudi consulate a show she disappearing they're October second with his fiance standing outside for hours waiting for him to come out and he never did for Saudi Arabia said he did walk out and now it's been two weeks and they've had to change their story\nThoroughly well I think on in many ways the story is incredibly shocking and its details it's really just a different than degree rather than kind as far as what we've seen Saudi Arabia capable of doing 'em over the years and particularly under the crown prince so on as a reporter pointed out many\nThe latest developments with a show jays case have only further\nAnd reinforce the feeling that many activists and writers and students and um any everyday Saudi who may be abroad feels that they're never quite beyond the reach of the Saudi Government and\nUm as as your for your privacy previous guest just mentioned um there's a mall was not even a\nDissident he was very clear on that while he was alive he was a reformer for a long time he was the loyalist and it was only in very recently many didn't yeah yeah exactly if we're not going far enough he he wanted to even believe that my husband Solomon couldn't deliver on some of his promises early on\n'em but it was only when he saw the crown prince taking actions that directly contradicted all the promises of reform and liberalization and that he felt the need to step out so um\nYeah we we've seen all of this before in in a sense and we I've spoken to many Saudis\nWho have spent years abroad who who maybe like 'cause I'm all for show Dave put themselves in a self imposed exile on because they felt it was no longer safe for them to be speaking out or or writing on\nFreely within the kingdom but then on as some of ... on family experience some of their family might have been placed under house arrest under travel bans on threatened or harassed by the government so there's none of this I'm In many ways this is not\nUm a departure for Saudi Arabia and I'm In the same same way you mentioned Trump's response unfortunately we've seen him\nVery very willing to be flexible on the troops that have changed his story to really not honestly be um apparently looking for the truth but looking for a story that fit I'm as a justification for what he wants to do\n... will just been a lot of attention obviously in the world press to the ...\nDissidents women dog Saudi Arabia to\nThank you for asking about that that's something I think that\nUm we we on those with we're following the story this summer on we're really confounded at the the world's lack of response when I'm ... made a lot of pomp and circumstance about finally giving women the right to drive up until this\nPast year on women in Saudi Arabia where the only woman on the planet who didn't have that right so it's very symbolic and it was a a meaningful change for for many women on but the world was willing to ignore the fact that\nAt the same time Mohammed bin Salman was jailing the very women who had worked for years or decades calling for the right to drive among other\nHuman rights and rights for women on Luiz ... Lula as he's out of the oh says\nI'm among many others had to had a sassy some of the most prominent women activists some of them had to work at this the seventies for equality um were jailed um without any real public charges or in the case of losing that has little\nGovernment propagate and rumors that they were foreign agents agents of ... thought on and\nAnd and explain the earth is brilliant piece over the summer about when the decision came down what they've been fighting for four years I sometimes getting behind the wheel being arrested um when the decision came down they got calls I'm like a ... a flu\nI'm not to speak or to tweet about like\nYeah let's talk about ... for a second so we Jane was in a losing was a prominent human rights activists and she was in Riyadh when this announcement came from a home events or from king Solomon um but as part of my ... ... grand on agenda\nUm she was in Riyadh only because she had been abducted from the you eat a few months before she was studying for her masters\nAnd then a few months later on was arrested but before that when she was sitting at home watching the announcement come down about women driving she knew about that of a from a few days prior\nWhen the royal court called her personally and told her to remain silent to not speak publicly even in praise of the of the new lifting of lifting of the ban as um a way of controlling the narrative that tightly that that's one of the many instances where we saw\nHow NBS the crown prince is so I'm\nReally obsessed with controlling the narrative from the right and the last even in praise yeah even in praise he didn't want to appears to be giving something to activists responding to activists to what happened\nAlternately very crowded yeah she did she eventually treated at ... which means thank God that's it and got word that yeah thank God for you know the right to drive and very quickly\nWas sent a message from someone from the real court saying we told you not to speak and just if you know it's good for you basically you'll shut up\nNext week another woman activists it's all going hum a faces trial and\nYeah there's um there are several people going on trial in Saudi Arabia next week including ... who may face the death penalty the prosecutors are asking for the death penalty there's likely to be on\nOther charges against her um basically undermining the state she and she has a connection with a\nMinority groups and um activists in the kingdom on and a Saturday the Saudi Government especially under and the U.S has been expanding its definition of terrorism\nIt's crackdown and cybersecurity laws I'm using the phrase fake news spreading fake news or defamation against the real family is incurring higher and higher penalties including him\nOr imprisoned by the government hundreds have been jailed in under ... including in the ... in the last year Fifteen journalists just in the kingdom alone so this is again something that ambience has been showing us his intent and his um willingness to trample on human rights and to\nUm be completely intolerant of of free speech for among his own citizens so while the ... case there's a mall is grizzly and and bizarre and shocking it's again not a departure from what we've seen from the U.S and from prior um Saudi rulers\nOf course not to mention what's happening in Yemen every single day in the worst humanitarian crisis in the world bank by the United states the Saudi coalition constant bombing yeah\nOf this country yeah\nAdd I'm I've spoken to I I have um many contact with in Saudi Arabia and among the diaspora\n\n\n\nI'll listen to the time and time to get in\nThe well the two major source right\nAround me\nGoing back and\nNow he's saying is a\nHobby\nNow he's saying is that and\nTo me and to your show\nAnd I mean there has\nSaying is that\nAnd then bam\nBut just um\nKnow what he's saying shame um\nI mean there\nSaying is\nSaying they were\nAnd then you\nA man\n\n... ... ...\n... ... ...
