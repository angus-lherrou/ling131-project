consulting group had quoted in Newport\nIsland who is an economic consultant who helps small businesses and I'm going to Washington to define what he means by small business but\nUp to twelve fifty employees perhaps perhaps more Ron welcome to road cost and watch and it's a small business\nWill be official definition as five hundred people are less but there's a lot\nI think of small businesses up to like three hundred people are most of the clients that I deal with a hundred or less employees now your\nStrength is you go in and you tell people to have this all businesses how to make them more profitable and how to keep them in business what are the common mistakes you encounter\nWell I think the first thing is that um small business owners if they don't think about what the business strategy you should be which really is like\nWhat are you doing that's a different what is your secret sauce going to be what ... are you feeling what would need argue answering they don't think about that so if you if you think about\nSome nice then you can wrap everything around delivering that nice the second thing is they don't think about marketing and identifying who their target customer is and what are their characteristics and\nA how to reach them and ... and so forth and so on so that is a lack of a really defined and focused business strategy and marketing strategy um it can be really detrimental\nI seen small businesses everywhere and the common\nFactor tends to be that somebody had trained\nOr profession more commonly a trade show how they could ... self employment it's a step in small business and then ... and had a five to twelve employees will all the way up to hundreds but never really knew how to run a business\nHad no training\nThe business side of what we're doing didn't understand that our taxes and corporations profitability long term goals ... getting chump named ready to sell it at the end of the building\nYou're an automobile mechanic kind of the staunchest ... thinking about that as being really thinking about getting a premises enough tools and enough customers and maybe some credit or the bank and in that school voter block\nAbsolutely and and that's kind of a the good side of the bad side altogether because I'm usually an entrepreneur is as good at something they're good at making something or delivering a service but\nThey don't think about these other things and it's really important\nUh to think about it especially going back to the strategy for one second you can't be all things to all people like you really have to pick out\nA little sub market that you're going to try to address because the the big broad markets are being addressed by big companies so you'll have to differentiate yourself that it's absolutely critical for small business\nSo that they're not many small businesses that just being able to sit down and say what is needed on and they are they sit down and say I'm an address I can starches outlawing I'm\nA I'm a I'm a wild drunk I started drilling business that's the way it also means that the majority of the small entrepreneur knows\nDon't usually have a lot of formal education they tend to be able to walk with their hands and then go into business and have to work with their hands and their minds\nYou see a lot of deficiency that\nWell it's kind of some some of the some people are where well educated but they don't they still don't have all the skills to run a business and a lot of people as you say work with their hands and they need a little bit of help on some of these other\nAspects of a business and unfortunately a lot of business in fail over some of those other details\nUm and so it's a you know it's a really big problem what are the\nThings you have to overcome when you were hired\n... and you think some version was set up with the time she just going to come in and do a lot of calculations embarrassed them humiliate them and at the end of the day still not understand what that business is\nSo I think one of the things is that um I get clients because they have certain problems that they're not able to solve and they they fundamentally they want to make more money\nAnd they they look at the different problems and the different things they might do but sometimes one problem what a solution to one problem aggravates a different problem that they have and so they can't sorted out\nSo one of the things that um I've done is to create this process called the Apollo profit acceleration technique and it's it's really the fastest way to figure out what are the right most to make to drive a profitability it's a three step process I model the business I\nDo scenario analysis and identified the key drivers of success what are the things that are going to change profitability by twenty percent fifty percent eighty percent not three percent four percent\nIn the second step I look at all those things and see which ones can we effect which ones we in control and which ones were are beyond our control and I crafts strategies to move the dials on that same\nLet's just go to a case study on this one from your experience on and where you've been able to come in and with full everything you've just said drink one success\nA good example of working with a a doggie daycare with three locations and um\nThey weren't making very much money and they had a very high end one doesn't have as doggy day care is seeing a big money is exactly can still be ... absolutely\n... on most days so one of the things that are we figured out was we needed people to buy more from us so we devised the pricing strategy which is also something small businesses don't know that much about\nAnd and and basically they you could come in and just use it for a day you could buy ten visit punch cards and what we decided we wanted people to come in that we're going to use it a lot so we raised the price of the single visit we raised the price of the ten\nPunch cards and we came up with an all you can use in a month\nFor a very a\nA very kind of exciting and compelling price and that way you could you know you were shopping on the weekend and you were out you know five days a week you could just drop\nYour dog off anytime injured do some serious analysis of what the dog and she told me about this and they wanted to be waiting for ...\nWell this particular place had the dog's not\nIn a in kind of\nChanges or cooped up playing with other dogs so I Would say a lot of the dogs but a light [laughter]\nGive me another assault another business was a bowling\nAlley and they needed to transition to be a multi entertainment center but in the short run and they didn't have the funds to do that so\nThey were selling bowling by by the time you can play as many games in thirty minutes or sixty minutes or whatever you buy some what we figured out was we needed to sell more food and beverage and and drinks writes we need to drive up the spin\nHer visit and the way to do that was could charge by game instead of by time so that wasn't the penalty for hanging out\nYou know getting food eating food using up your\nBy something that you wouldn't even think about is the solution to a business problem awesome right in front of the proprietors knows I'll tell you that\nDone a lot of this modeling and sorting this out for clients and um sometimes some of the biggest factors are not even on our radar scope and uh it's partly because world too close to it but even when I come in and I looked at it\nYou think about it well that might work a little bit but as I can really move the dial it doesn't seem like it would really moved the dial but when you you look at an average spend of Seventy eight cents on food for a visit and you can drive up to you know two dollars and a quarter on average that's a lot of money [laughter]\nWith a good margin on that translates to a lot of profitability so I Would say that you know we're always trying to find the kind of secret sauce that fits each business that is the thing that really drives the profitability and in Austin that is not that visible\nI I get the phone rings you know quite often with I'm thinking about this business idea and I'll go meet with them\nTalk to them and see whether the idea holds any water or point out the nine reasons why that's a bad idea and I just said you a lot of money you know kind of strategy\nUm you know one of the things about the phrase things people want to be the you know they want to charge less that's their their way of doing it and I tell them you know think about your business idea and how much you want to invest and let's save a lot of time you just write me a check for that amount\nBecause that's not going to succeed by itself as a small business\nRun would you forgive me if I travel a little story I started when I like to me was the first women's liberation magazine New York about Nineteen sixty five I had a partner who is bring Julie along very well we'll deal\nAnd I was and it was a small world publishing very soon evil that I was trying to solve this magazine of course I certainly knew in the country and I didn't know very many people I I started it and a very famous ... brother and\nNew Tori is probably better was a bomb Harrison who had just started confidential magazine and become a multi millionaire or by shouting sleazy my mind that say that he grabbed me took me injured ribbons restaurant on fifteenth street in New York City and he said you're starting\nYou have to charge fifty well basic economic ... street abolishing well known and I said we all are feeling I had the market will stand it it's too expensive and he said oh General Motors ought to how much you can afford to pay for a call\nFifty cents your when that if I understand you're dead game\nI was did um access to sense if the audience should mortgage we weren't just exceeded before news magazine and not just in sort of challenge that I think small business faces and where they need help so did you sell us fifty cents a thirty five thirty five and fail\nA very close to succeed him in a way it wasn't enough\nWhat ... are very tricky thing and small businesses need to learn how to use pricing can drive customers into behaviors that make sense though in in the doggie daycare example we want to customers that we're going to use a lot of stuff that was the behavior that we wanted and so we priced it so that\nWe would get that behavior we would attract those kind of customers the people that wanted a one off the down the street and save money and we didn't care\nAnd uh uh\nWhen you see in a company that you think can be saved that they're doing so many things that are going to dash and I'm just fail what'd you say I'm In is your client is it'd be real pain you tell them that they are in terrible trouble or do you try to\nIntroduce a strategy which will ameliorate the problem or what happened\nTell them and uh sometimes you they haven't given me the complete picture especially early on and so that's very unfortunate because then as I dig down it's you know really bad um so if I can come up with a strategy to do something about it which is\nYou know a fair number of the cases you know we can talk about it but they have to\nTo you know deliver product or service efficiently make money on it identify customers to sell to them do all these things\nAnd except they don't have any money to carry it all off in big companies you know have the cash flow when they get into problems to solve the problem ... paper rogue and shake and paper over mistakes and\nAh with small companies you don't have the money so you have to be able to especially in a turnaround\nHas to be something feasible\nFor them they have to be you'd have to come up with really creative solutions to the same problem that a big company would just spend money on of how they're going to do it and if you can shame them along so that the improved cash flow from the first thing they do helps support the next three things\nAnd then those in turn\nYou know create more money then you start to chain up a turn around and that's really the only thing that's

Pennsylvania [noise]\n\n\n\nThere's another safety issue to consider when we're talking about pipelines the safety of the workers who build and maintain them\nAnd that's the subject of a piece by journalist Antonio you us in the latest issue of Pacific Standard magazine it's called death on the Dakota access an investigation into the deadly business building oil and gas pipelines\nYou'll remember Dakota Access is the almost twelve hundred mile underground crude oil pipeline the begins in the Balkans shale region of North Dakota and ends in Illinois\nThe final stage of its construction was the cause of mass protests and a standoff between Native American and other activists and law enforcement\nThe pipeline is owned by energy transfer partners which also owns the natural gas pipeline that exploded in beaver county I recently spoke with Antonio you pass through your investigation and reporting you found that oil and gas pipeline workers had a higher fatality rate than the average American worker\nTell me about the numbers and where the data came from when I discovered that one worker\nThe north Dakota Associated Press\nI decided to look more deeply into what caused his death and then\nTo ask this question of overall safety and security what I found out was that the bureau of Labor Statistics which publishes fatality rate data for you know it's what most people use it's a standard set of information that we use for understanding the fatality rates associated with different industries in the United states\nThey only started counting deaths in oil and natural gas pipeline construction are reporting them in two thousand and three\nAnd that they have never produced publicly a fait ... rate for oil and natural gas pipeline construction so I spoke with your of Labor Statistics and tried to\nYou understand why they hadn't run this information and they didn't really have an answer for me and they weren't planning on doing it and I couldn't convince them to do it so I decided to do it myself and crunching the numbers\nI came up with this you know unique data set and I was not to compare apples to oranges I created using the same model and again using bureau of Labor Statistics data\nBoth if a towel itty rate for oil and gas pipeline construction workers and a national fatality rate with which to compare it with what I came up with is oil and gas pipeline construction workers having a phage holiday rate in two thousand and sixteen\nThat was three point six times the national average for the average American worker\nAnd that it has reached highs of seven times the average rate and since two thousand and three has average four point three times the fatality rate for the average American worker you mentioned the worker who died during the Dakota access pipeline\nA little bit about what happened to them John as such as death I did a freedom of Information Act request a interviewed a sheriff and other local um parties but there are no witnesses to his death ... working\nAlone essentially out near where Dakota Access pipeline where it starts and he was working at the very tail and a pipeline construction and he in fact should never worked on pipeline construction before he was only three weeks into the job\nAnd he was driving a tractor so pipe was already in the ground the earth was returned above it and he was retailing the land using something called a river to allow vegetation to grow their again\nAnd he was as I uncovered is very typical in this industry\nA sub contractor to a subcontractor to a subcontractor subcontractors the tractor he was working on had been altered it jammed he got out to fix it himself jammed a crow bar into the river and these guys like bleeds that are used to kill the ground\nDislodged and struck him in this goal he made his way back into the tractor and was randomly founded by his foreman who happened to be driving another worker to another tractors site\nAnd he died from a skull fracture less than twenty four hours after being injured and just three days later at the other end of the pipeline in Illinois another worker ... Dolan\nWas also killed and his dad had not been reported as associated with the Dakota access pipeline until I\nFiled a freedom of Information Act request and started digging and his was you know just exceptionally avoidable he had been suffering from heat stroke all day moving heavy equipment around he seemed to have sought out shade under\nSo he passed out and the driver of the truck move the truck not knowing he was under it and crushed him to death killing him ...\nWho was looking out for these workers what are the regulations even though oil and gas extraction and pipeline construction are considered part of the mining sector by the federal government they are not subject to the more stringent mining health and safety act\nWhich requires inspections of sites whether or not there's been an incident whether or not or there's been a reported problem a death or injury even do oil and natural gas extraction and pipeline construction have among the highest fatality rates in the nation\nBoth sectors fall under instead of mining they fall under the regular OSHA\nOccupational safety and health act and it's less stringent safety requirements so no mandatory inspections and in fact before John as such as death\nIn the previous six months OSHA had not inspected a single part of the Dakota access pipeline at all until he died um and one reason for that is how few\nOSHA inspectors there are there's only eight and the entire state of North Dakota\nAnd they associate yo has found that it would take OSHA one hundred years in North Dakota to inspect every job site just once\nAnd the sectors oil and gas and pipeline construction are considered low hazard industries which means that they are subject to less stringent OSHA oversight\nAnd that was already the condition going into the Trump Administration\nFor example right now there is no OSHA administrator or under the Trump Administration it has significantly last staff including inspectors and the Trump Administration has eliminated and failed to enforce a number of Obama era\nHerman including what is posted on the bureau of Labor Statistics website and what information needs to be made publicly available in terms of injuries and fatalities that had gathered from the companies\nIs there a difference between building an oil pipeline like the Dakota access pipeline versus a gas transmission line like the ones we have here in Pennsylvania\nThere is a difference and but not as significant difference so basically it's a standard set of procedures for how you build a pipe regardless of what's going to pass through it there are different regulations in terms of how deep the pipe needs to be in the ground\nThickness of the pipe but basically in terms of the process of building it's the same um\nI also found that in pipeline construction and this is very important to Pennsylvania\nCompared to the previous decade pipelines felt since two thousand and ten carrying oil and other hazards liquids or more than twice as likely to suffer incidents and those carrying natural gas are over five times more disaster prone\nAnd that impacts of course both workers whose job it is to install it to maintain it even more importantly and the people who live near those pipelines and so we are seeing a rash of hype plant explosions recently particularly pipelines carrying natural gas that are both\nSuffering failures because they're too old and suffering failures because there are two new\nAntonio you has his article death on the Dakota access and an investigation into the deadly business a building oil and gas pipelines adheres in the latest issue of the specific standard magazine there's a link and more of our conversation at Allegheny Front dot org and this is the Allegheny Front I'm Carol holds up all\n[noise]\nStray chin is holding hearings across the country on a rule to roll back Obama era vehicle emissions standards State Impact Pennsylvania's Amy Sisk reports from

thing we started off with this crew and we really enjoyed it it's a Nick ... and the guy goes into the mantle actually I'm not feeling to grab the last night but uh I'll get over it throughout the week I don't know I'm next week not attached to a shortage of men\nAnd did ask you you are clearly talking about the Pittsburgh Steelers I'm losing is the Baltimore Ravens at home on Sunday Night Football I'm very ...\n[noise] big concern for the Steelers was there are all things right very the very dynamic often that did not show up\nSteps of force here's why I'm not concerned about the Pittsburgh Steelers often string Ben Roethlisberger number one of the league in yards per game with three hundred and fifty three yards for passing for game now his ratings only a Ninety point to twenty certainly but that is\nOnly a point for now he's completion percentage I'm Sorry ... percent of the ... percent it's only point for behind Brady and its point five better than Aaron Rodgers therefore I'm not I'm not all too concerned about Ben Roseburg I think he's performing well\nA last night it was rough game but sometimes a office is going to have some games and that's when we need our deepest really pick us up so I'm gonna\nBe a typical steel ahead Roman aerospace Keith Boehner's defense right now still or civil defense right now is thirty is in the league boys thirtieth an elite behind only the buccaneers and the chiefs have been getting letting up through the first four weeks\nThe Steelers defense allows four hundred and twenty and a half yards per game\nShe always wouldn't penalize forty two times giving up a total of four hundred and twenty yards and that is most by far or both the beating the next closest team I think the Jacksonville Jaguars a seven less penalties and forty seven less penalty yards\nThat's really what's beating the Steelers your Steelers have four hundred and eleven yards a game offensively and but uh Arthur dumping for a convergence we just can't get it done Fifteen for forty nine thirty one percent is twenty if in the league\nMan oh I'm hating the Steelers to the\nAnd truthfully all those facts that you just said it's not even the players fault that is strictly coaching that is it's strictly coaching I mean\nThe beat that undisciplined I Know the first three weeks they had the ... they were second NFL history for most penalties in the first three weeks and I definitely got the record now throughout the first four weeks an NFL season the most penalize team ever ... within the first\nWell do it on on coaching I I mean you got to steal a secondary would admit it since the beginning of the season that it's terrible it's got awful um\nBut to say that it's just strictly coaching you gotta look they left I'd say Crabtree and John Brown open how many times you know way too much and yeah so it's not just coaching it's the players they have no they have no sense of where there where the fences on the field\nThey're just they're clueless out there it's unbelievable how they're reacting they are clueless and it it's\nThank goodness Michael Crabtree leaves Lincoln drops every single year 'cause he dropped about five balls yesterday that we're right in his hands and that could just kill the Steelers\nHowever I'm gonna I'll be a little bit positive towards this defense now they started off terrible let up first two they love touchdowns however the Baltimore Ravens were the number one red zone team coming into this game\nAnd they've only stay on the court to talk shows I watched after after the game Joe Flaco was an interview and they asked him how he felt and he said you know what I'm kind of frustrated because I'm trying to force myself to be happy this is a quote I remember I said I'm a genius I was I got that I got the Sean McVeigh memory I'm a genius he said uh\nI'm just frustrated 'cause I'm trying to force myself to be happy because there were ... points that we did not score that should've been scored he said they left it wide open for us\nTo finish and we cannot capitalize on her opportunities and that's coming from the quarter back to just walked ... bought and he says he's frustrated because he knows he should've scored way more because the defense was that bad so he's saying so I guess\nThe deep and stop them the deepest did their job I mean they only let they let them know touchdowns the office like you said they only like Nineteen or total Russian yards which\n... laughing at now because ...\nHere's my thing was deals often when you take a player out like lady on bell ... that I didn't a team game plans around and play like late ... getting back into the guys we saw last night if any indication if there was any indication that last night\n[noise] but the ... and it hurts me the most is that he is fifty fifth fifty fifth among all running backs in league with yards precarious three point seven fifty fifth fifth the fifth of running backs alone [laughter] the ... just the rushing attack when\nWhen you don't have a play like lady on the on the field that ... the entire game plan going to be around Ben or stopping Ben Roethlisberger Antonio Brown just Mr and I did a fine job of that yeah last night in jail eventually had brown had nothing\nThat was something I think it was and then\nAs soon as he starts the fire he merely assumed it was the attorney round here's Chuck that he didn't even care where it was going accuracy was off but yeah it ... the offensive altogether was it just collapsed yet under everything Connor we yeah he's young and I know I'm a corner lovers someone to defend them in all cases\nYeah he's he's young so we still starting off he's going to have one bad game here and there is a right to fifty fifth and yours for carry that you have to play on the line for that one too\nI might be concerned about the whole sense at all when I see Judy Smith and uh Jews misused aren't Antonio Brown has fifty nine combined receptions through four games thirty one twenty nine respectively\nMost by any two in the league besides Adam feeling as the following days right now\nSo I'm not concerned about the Altman's whatsoever often is going to have bad games the defense has to be there to pick 'em up\nTom and he's a defensive coach a and really that's what's lacking for I mean the the defense shut up in the second half yesterday our defenses miserable that we can't we can't tackle to save our lives we can't stop them on first second or third down even for Donald's we saw last night he felt when he was fired my ...\nI think we need to get ready to act a little bit of time it's only a sports game and the often more than ... have been together for quite some time now so we've got to give them a chance to get going but the defense just it just on excusable just one how many years we've been saying\nYeah we're moving Santa for a while and I'm going to go back to the office of war on a statement it was like the office of winds bad like we say that they're not playing well given a caught a corners yards per carrier\nHoles for a living on Bo they're not making wholes as they're making holds its just car can't find them as well as because like you said he's young so he can develop into it but\nWe don't have time this is not a time to mess around I might look at them we're ... not that last in the division\nTied for dead last in the division of the same record as the Cleveland freaking Brown's so I that's a ... it's ... it's now or never to get the when the super bowl bans only here for a few more years Antonio browser only gonna be healthy I mean yeah shore Judy can be a few more years but what's Jew Jew without Ben I mean what's to any wide receiver unless there's right now without\nThe hall of fame quarterback to counter will chant passing them if the whole team runs through ban went battles calling his own place you could always going to replace running the auto doing his own thing second quarter he looked flawless the Steelers often looked flawless steals often needs to keep they need to do what ... does\nWhatever ... well I don't like Aaron Rodgers and clearly he's not doing too well the season but this is what he's known for he keeps the fence on the field\nRight he he doesn't he puts the drives that needs to be driven he he takes all the time because he knows his defense isn't that good he's a game manager he's gay manager yeah so in my column was probably worst damage I I but I can call up a nine year old and play a game of matter when somebody who manage a clock better than the common good so\nUh that's a problem I think that's the problem I think the fence three and out every time they were too for eleven on third down convergence that's just down the third down wins games as simple as that I mean ... that's that's what happens you can vote on third down you're going to win the game\nSo after that we'll probably go back will probably be coming back to the Steelers because why not were pretty passionate about it so well rewind all went to the beginning\nOf the NFL week that was Thursday night on Fox now where the Vikings face off against the rams and the Los Angeles rams looked\nActivate the next game I told him down one oil John how you know you ought man\n... why not speaking of great defense is the Jacksonville Jaguars absolutely just slaughtered the New York jets yesterday while I mean look at who they played the jets\n... oh not look good at all is that I was given up his safety as they occur well and they just they just did not bring they will stand Arnold and all like he was and is already yesterday at all\nNo but like borders look good he really did like ... absolutely phenomenal I think like board was always looks good I liked this get I think he's really underrated yeah I I agree I think it was very ready to\n[noise] I I\nWould agree with that to an extent I think he uh he gets a lot of credit 'cause he he likes to\nJust 'cause he puts up good that you got to watch what do you actually does really a lot of his passing confirm checked downs was running backs and I mean that's just that's what gets you to lend that could get you to win so I'm not going to take any mocking discredit their options for that but yeah like balls is definitely not announce he'll pass or he really just checks down and runs a bowl of anything so yeah he\nIs actually ... he is the most efficient running quarterback NFL he\nManages the game and it gets them it gets them or when so\nHe he literally is the most efficient Russian quarterback in the NFL when he runs he's getting positive yard edge every single time he's smart I think that's smart I think that's smart football\nHe's not rush anything he's not they're not trying to they don't they don't even play it's not even a set calls for him to run the ball he just he just reads the defense and he can run yesterday was twenty nine for thirty eight three hundred and\nEighty eight yards throws eighty or almost four hundred yard and two touchdowns but on the same note letter form that went down here\nOut hamstring injury for the second time a season so ah yeah that that really hurts they're often ... especially because he's their main source of their off and so\nYeah there's no time table do return I guess they rush it to come back because he was injured and writing back and then he re injured in that same game TJ out and he played well do you look like had to touch Tony ... one rushing touched on one receiving touchdown so white forests praying find the Jackson wall fences doing just fine\nI think the Jacksonville Jaguars making a nice long run the season\nOf yeah and uh\nOther injuries we saw or Thomas everyone ... Thomas go down as he was getting cut it off the field\nPut the middle finger up to the Seattle Seahawks entire sideline that including ... that's including everyone on the sideline there 'cause once you do that you can't say all wasn't that you you know in the locker room after right that's just straight well have a single person we know and I I'm sure that Seattle's their their players\nThe raw so they know that that wasn't direct towards and that was directed straight to the front office being careless directed straight to the general manager of the owner when you've got to start boiling Earl Thomas you pay that man yeah that that someone you want to keep on your ball club he's he said he's willing to stay in Seattle as long as he gets paid\nA it's not like he's asking too much either a ... I mean trade them he ... I respect her Osama because he came out he didn't get his money and he's still would\nStill give it's hard to the team and they screwed him he got hurt fractured as for what he did for a ... foot leg his leg yeah man that's that's a shame you know ... ... Twitter fingers and yeah and if we go all I'll still be the bad guy and said I'll ...\nI'll be ... you're the bad guys look at this guy's you're putting this article on for a steam even though he's not getting his money yeah and then he was the teams are good right\nYeah this is just ... it was a Superbowl caliber I the Seattle Seahawks are not all problems just loves the game he loves to buy up All right guess what role Thomas won the super bowl\nRight he's he's a champion easily yeah\nWhat's the weather in belle ever done which he ever done party yeah forty ... W why if you can trade in Miami and when the super bowl miraculously he's wrong there's no way like yeah you could go down to Miami and make a difference but they're not a Super Bowl contender teams dealers are like you said yeah and if he were to if he were to just play\nLike he would what a Super Bowl and somehow see like oh maybe St Pittsburgh is not a bad thing after all whether I get paid or not\nThe un American or franchised tag that's under a franchise that he wants to more he wants\nAnd he actually he's going to get it when you look at when you heat when you look around the NFL right now like we're saying let her for net evil elite running back they don't even when they don't but not the Jacksonville Jaguars they don't need a letter from that to win the game yeah\nYou know how many ... Super Bowl is the patriots won without any lead running back five literally five but they want five Super Bowls without and lead running back it's you know many times are girlie one Super Bowl non you know how much when he got paid a ... a ton of money for a pay them as much money as living about ones paid in he's\nThey don't win I mean they have yet to prevent anything so I mean ... just hurting him he's just hurting himself\nYeah he's evaluating his um player value pretty much he's he's wasting all these weeks sitting around not working I was partying so he's eating regularly can you physically getting worse no one's going to want to want him\nTrade deadline coming up soon and no one's going to trade for him now his way too late yeah and even I think it's Adam chef there even sat down SPN that's way too late to trade them now and I really wish the Steelers were executed trade with sea hawks Carol Thomas or levy on bell before Thomas got hurt I really think that would impact both things in a positive way because yes the or they would have been further secondary\nSee ... to give them a running game finally yeah in Seattle yesterday I don't know if you guys saw Mike Davis you want to get people together quite the game at my um my son he's going to be the running back in the future but definitely could be you know hey it's running game they haven't had Sonia ... starting him so\nYeah I mean he he did that when he did it last year to you had a big game right for them so\nI mean we keep saying that everyone keeps saying that you you was listeners everyone I Know I Know what I was probably even listen to this honestly so I Hope he is allowed to tweet at me adjunct to like seven to ... that's my Twitter so say something back because have you on bill you fat boy you [laughter]\nActually we are paid leave now I just finally what will be I Would I Would not even ... you become a cancer the theme really\nYeah and uh now I just got I liked I put it back on the team won the super bowl and then do whatever you want I mean I don't ever want to respect\nEverything he's done for our franchising I I'm I'm grateful for him I'm grateful that he's been one of the most productive running back to the last couple years for us but men don't they might if it's something that goes on the\nGolf yeah makes you happy at ... actually makes you happy that\nThat we have like insomnia brown I don't care what he says on Twitter I don't care what Gatorade bottles Antonio Brown is throwing on the field because when it started when it comes time to catch the ball and catch a touchdown\nUntil you brown is doing it and I mean you saw a lot of the third down huge started down conversion yesterday wide open Ben fruit behind them yeah I mean that when a being easier to open one of the play needs to be made a B makes the place so there's a difference between Antonio Brown and loved though you know he's worth the money I don't think about though is I agree I agree it\nWill stay will stay in the AFC North west the bangles I think it was an upset I say it was I was at its and I was with\nDiet and I'll say yeah well not really thought things were wanting to going into the game I really don't and they're wanting to there will now now they're wanting to at home so they look pretty shaky coming into that game but I I mean ... strong religious books in great numbers it was just bangles often says too much for and honestly yeah I'm a Steeler fan but\nI I praise them they're doing really good in showing the I mean there are leading the AFC North I agree and I think a out looking back\nI think Andy Dalton and the bangles often look really good yesterday but it's also you can remember against a very hampered a\n... they didn't have force started his er and um that's huge news guy like Keanu Neal the on Jones it at hundreds of defense and yet that you ... ... yesterday hopefully the Steelers can do that next week against them\nYeah I Hope so too because if the Steelers are unable\nA little bit because of the Arabs see north and how good they are looking how good the ravens are looking at how good the bangles or looking and so I mean if they if they can't get it done against the falcons I'm not sure the clear I'm not sure they're going to be able to get it done against the bangles\nI'm ah I'm obviously I'm a Steelers fan so but I'm going to give the bank was a hard time here are they haven't really be a mountain pressed by another one so far they beat a a week or and injured falcon secondary they beat the Colts weak or you got to be the Colts week one\nI'm really I just ... I'm a real big on the on the bangles so for the last uh they who they beat the ravens which I guess this deal is going to get it done against ... who knows they all have the Panthers and a good game so\nI mean they'd be I mean they beat the ravens and the ravens have the number one defense or\nHave on the number one run defense in any dog got done\nAnd they don't they get it on the age of green in the last second that was literally one second round the clock when a G A green card that game winning touchdown which is rare for any don't come in college but not river AJ green because Asia green is\nIf not number one wide receiver he might be up there with number to hold a jazz however not hold jobs not collect you caught the game and in touch with and stay Holyoke Jones or ... you know who\nGetting the game plan gone for the next couple of years because I mean that the next couple of years I can be easily division contenders every area of yeah for sure\nBut the brown so they'll ... they'll they'll find a way to\nThey'll find a way not to be honestly they couldn't make it to the Superbowl be undefeated and they'll find a way to get shut out at the same syllable do go to another overtime game we had the Texans beating the colds over a bizarre\nCoaching decision to go forward on Fort down in overtime which is all converting the Texans caught the ball and scores so\nI guess I guess I don't even know what to say there because the Texans looked terrible they love the show watching I mean he had a decent\nFourth down just 'cause I Know that it's a regional man he he probably can't kick it as far as the one's good\nUm but uh\nUm I I Would never play for a dive I'm Frank Reich I I liked that moved on it for for Donna I'm for the city of Minneapolis questioning of today are probably upset with him but um I mean hey I'm I'm a competitive guy myself I I Would not be planning on Fort down at the end of the game either\nSo you guys think those is Andrew Luck slush anything when you come back I mean he's he was MVP contender is Super Bowl contending quarterback and now he got hurt and I was going back and watch the show nothing where do you\nGuys I'd say his show and I think great stuff he completed forty past that amazing four hundred and sixty four yards do fortunately down your interceptions in spite the fact they lost nearly questionable decision mhm\nI I think Andrew locks on the up I [noise] the running game\nI'm not sure about that and I think it had to order and they just they really to run game and he'll be say and he'll go yeah and he didn't offer dolphins that's what all ... yeah ... yeah right Andrew Luck I think he's he's on the up I wouldn't count him out yet I honestly wouldn't count the colds yeah 'cause honestly I was surprised at the Texans beat them yesterday\nSo I mean I think the Colts grant one and three record I think they're still going to finish up season really strong think they're going to have a great team the in the years to come\nAnd basically it's a you'd think so you think ... a Andrew Luck and still be a top of the division like he was\nNot what what do you not with what he's given you can only do so much with what you're given yeah um you can't stick a star quarterback with about ... ... are wide receivers in tight end I mean you've got air Iran his one of the best titans I've seen so far\nUm but ...\nI'm not the heat wise yeah he's not shown me the numbers that I Want to see out of him um but yeah he I mean Andrew give credit to him he's doing what you can yeah he's not All right it's just they're not producing for a minute\nWe all play fantasy football fashionable even I'm very Sharif in the owners of the NFL fans evil right because it's just it's part of the game is gambling is now legal experience family is now legal so it's even bigger than it is in years past it's it's\nOne of my favorite things about the NFL I think of as a whole other dimension to it it adds up it adds a sense of a connection you know I just had some extra gratification when your player score maybe you're not rooting for the Steelers however you know still last month as you football team on\nSam I'm so it's like it's like it's [laughter] it's like a\nNot a bad I mean obviously rather have the Steelers when both ... once you like uh not too bad of a week you know what I'm saying so we'll do a some players some busts or\nIf you think it's too early in the year Tacoma bus right perfect also will start probably I mean obviously living on bell was the boss but uh [laughter] to ... ...\nMaybe he comes in late in the team that team's good and that seems really winning and then the team that has ... wins even more because they have living bell but\nWe'll start with Arizona corals running back David Johnson do you think he is a bust a season or do you think it's just too early to tell\nI think he's a bus I agree if he was rank too high in the ... and the preseason polls I'm In a fancy sheets they ranked in the number three behind levy on bill\nAfter a whole year on the IRR that's a really bold move to make whenever he was like I said he just spent the entire season on the eye are I think he's a bust I don't know why they Martin so high\nI also think that David Jones has been a bus or for a he is he will mean again I'm airs on according to the game plan around David Johnson users he's or star player on the other side of the ball a yeah you're not going to ... and he's definitely a bus for the Arizona Cardinals for sure we're talking about running back and just got\nPaid the money that\nRunning backs I guess now think they deserve it clearly they don't because\nAnd here looking at a I mean my leaks not necessarily PBR so I don't really go base too much of that but\nIt is what it is it's the same thing kind of another bus the season is definitely a double decker junior he hasn't caught a touchdown yet through four games uh I Can't really blame him all that too much as you I'm ... probably the worst one and quarterback animal thirty two [laughter] this year so far I'd say I'm\nPretty bad when you're older brother is really much of the polar opposite of you write Payton was it in my one of the most ultimate players and football history than he lies just describe I don't\n... which is crazy to think about that and said well I've read about that the only thing that you had on Peyton Manning and when he got you still do have it because I mean not without the MVPs all that I mean\nThey're saying that the day when they're sitting at Thanksgiving dinner in there and brings or clocking off to the knives and the forces or even with a ... to you know the same amount interest\nThat's all that's all I bet Peyton Manning so he cares about I mean I don't think painting men really cares about the MVP orgy one I think he wanted and win Super Bowls and clearly you saw that with him trying to do all we can get it done in Denver both sick with a running backs here if the boss\nOr surprises I mean here ... ... am I Am I'm looking at Carlos Hyde is force I Know I drafted him he's on my team costs on his fourth out of running backs over players like easy you Eliot sick one Barclay James Corner\nI that was a huge surprise you think as a surprise oh yeah things and keep it up to ...\nI think so I feel like he's going to start going downhill toward the middle of the season Nick jobs going to get us time to shine half but overall I think Carlos Hyde was a very big surprises in the fantasy world and if anything I think he was actually more easy to drop in the later rounds or more free agent pickups so definitely a big surprise\nI mean other than that I Can't really see another running back be running backs being like\nThe ... census sale insists movie with Patrick ... homes throwing the ball I mean ... if if you don't need to use dream hunt why why you know a team game plan around bedroom homes and that lethal receiving corps and uh then once once people start game plan around them ... job I Believe\nI have a bust uh LaSalle McCoy was from going up so I think he I think it's a boss not because of\nI think he's learning a lot of things to go to his head you know what that criminal charges and then he was he was injured I think we to think that was it and I think it's really getting to him so his fancy stocks going lower and lower each day [noise] um I think is the first time I actually had the bench him and three seasons playing fantasy football so it's\nI think was shot shady is definitely a huge buff in a\nShorter Howard I Know Jordan Howard he put out numbers he puts up numbers put numbers last year everyone picks them because they thought he was number one back but it looks like a ... a share some some significant time and I think that uh\nI think George Howard might be a bust I mean ... nah I think it's to her I think it's too early I take that back and he's on a bus it's too early bears or three in one I think they're going to continue to be the surprise of the season right so I think ... I ...\nI really like with the bears have with a with three Conan Jordan our cars there two completely different running backs you got three coming who can heat up ... is one hundred percent certified blame maker a ... view let him getting open field who he had the chance sticking to the house every single time with all the moves yes so and he's just so ... uh\nI think they're looking to use them a lot more than a passing game uh Jordan Howard though you're not going up the numbers we thought we'd see from him but it gives them time\nAnd uh I Know my boss I think this is a bus I don't think he's gonna get better my first round pick because running backs are so valuable Derek Henry ice skating Russia's he's getting some Russian I just he's doing\nIn Tennessee and I did not see that coming and I think the Louis look way better than Derek Henry in that when yesterday against the eagles were you guys think fast a and ...\nYeah I'd say I'd say ... ... like you said he he's not getting you look at me or not get in touch downs um but I think the ... the scheme and Tennessee a lot better just with Mariette of being a mobile quarterback I'm dealing loosened safety blanket you can just check it out to and he'll get yards and a first down on most of his most most of his reception so\nYeah I Would really like with the almost brings that they will for the Tennessee Titans are their country though is not not living up to the expectations you're\nWell and we saw this from the New England patriots when Dion Louis played for the past he was in my opinion they're number one ... were rough running back mhm um other than ... whenever they had him at the time the on Louis He's fantastic\nAnd that go ahead I'm\nSo weak three I picked the Cincinnati Bengals beat the Carolina Panthers I was wrong my whole take last week for a week for the NFL season I picked the Minnesota Vikings to knock off the LA ramps perfect record this week\nOff comes my whole takes him to come on Monday Night football ... like the Washington Redskins in New Orleans taking it a game of the science of oh\nI don't mind that at all\nI can see that ... I can I can see that the New Orleans defense with a little bit shaky\nA ...\nI guess my outtakes and say I think it needs to be New England on Thursday Night Football\nWow as I Want to be you know re Joyce [laughter] that's ...\nThrow a party there will be something else look forward to in ... a metric probably the week is going to be when the Jacksonville Jaguars traveled to arrowhead stadium and take on the Kansas City chiefs will see a crazy dynamic often versus the best defense in the league right now so the worst defense versus the best defense too so we'll see\nSo what we're doing some hot takes for the NFL here I'd a little bit of a hot taken a another sense of the word because the NHL season starts up in two days so that is beautiful 'cause the NHL is my favorite of course hockey\nThe most perfect of sports and I'll go with\nBeliefs like uh yeah and I think that I think I've got a I Hope so in other sports news I've got two more hot days for one's going to come from the

diligence that there would be an investigation into the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh and that would of course include\nInterviewing the witnesses Dr Ford um and the other two women um it would also include interviewing people who\nAre whose evidence who's testimony could support them or not support that it would also include interviewing Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI what we're hearing is that\nAh the White House counsel McGahn has somehow put limits on who the FBI can interview and made it very a very small number of people that's ridiculous that's absurd that's not the way these\nSupplemental background investigations proceed and it's not a real investigation if it turns out that that's what's happened that they've tried to whitewash this by interviewing only a couple of people a justice will not be served and this will be basically a whitewash I'm center Feinstein has requested more information about the scope of the interviews but quite frankly\nI'm I don't even think we should be having that sort of debate what happened on friday was a recognition that more needs to be known about Brett Kavanaugh before he is given the sort of lifetime position I think there's ample evidence that he lied I think he lied in his testimony on Thursday\nUm but you know the FBI should not be constrained by whatever limits the White House wants to impose because the White House wants to get Brett Kavanaugh on the court in fact at the White House had its way he'd be on that he'd be confirmed today\nLisa you said that we shouldn't be talking about ... she said he lied on Thursday judge Kavanaugh lied on Thursday under oath explain\nThink that the old two parts of that one is you know the ... the conversation nationally in some parts has been on this notion that women make false accusations it's exceedingly rare the actual problem\nOf rape of sexual harassment they deny it say falsely deny it that's the norm that's what usually happens sometimes they fall asleep at night with anger sometimes say falsely deny it through lawyers um but that's usually what happens women or come forward bravely\nTell their stories and men deny it and that's what we saw on friday um\nUh the the the statement of Brett Kavanaugh was appalling the idea that he would attack so senators for daring to investigate a credible allegation of of attempted rape is absurd and in fact it's more than a credible allegation what we saw was compelling consistent\nI Witness testimony from Dr Ford that should be fully credited what Brett Kavanaugh offered was anger anger isn't evidence of innocence is certainly not evidence that we're ... the consistent and compelling testimony\nDr Ford and in fact what you saw Brett Kavanaugh do was the symbol yet again about his history\nHis drinking history about his ... book about even the statements of people who have been asked about the incident claiming that they the other people who she says was there were there didn't denied it in fact most of them said they didn't remember it which is fully consistent with her statement\nIt wasn't significant for them it was significant for her\nUm but that's not the only time in which Brett Kavanaugh allied he I I Believe lied and his earlier testimony in ... in two thousand four and two thousand six and earlier this month about a number of matters including his role in receiving stolen confidential information\nInformation was stolen from the United States Senate about judicial nominations and\nLying about his role in those traditional nominations I think that this man Brett Kavanaugh tells lies big and small he's unfit for the bench he's certainly unfit to the United States Supreme court and I've called for him to be impeached not promoted but actually impeached so you're saying you're talking about impeach right now um\nThere is ample evidence for the house to begin an investigation or ... would begin in the house about the Senate that's the procedure under our constitution I don't know how long that sort of in Korea would take but they're certainly ample evidence that Brett Kavanaugh has been on truthful to the Senate that he lied under oath that he's misled the Senate\nEvery single time he testified he has testified falsely in my view his statements have been contradicted by evidence in two thousand for two thousand six earlier this month in ... in twenty Eighteen and just this past week\nAnd I want to get to those issues that you've raised before um you were a top aide to Senator Leahy when you're talking about\nUh you believe Brett Kavanaugh um ultimately when he was brought before the Senate um lied about information he got about judicial nominations when he worked for George W. Bush had like you to stay after the show we'll do a post show\nAnd posted on line at democracy now dot org under Web exclusive Lisa grapes co director of documented which investigates corporate influence\nOn a on democracy she's the former chief counsel for nominations for the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee at the time on a Senator Leahy this is democracy now or in thirty seconds we'll be speaking with Kimberly Crenshaw and be looking at parallels between Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh\nStay with us\n[noise]\n\nAt the age of eighty four this is democracy now democracy now dot org the war and peace report I mean the good and then our next guest argues when senators question Dr ... Ford last week they showed they failed to learn from Anita Hill's Nineteen Ninety One testimony against Clarence Thomas\n... actually came from African American women it was part of the civil rights freedom struggle so not knowing that history put feminists and anti racist at odds and that created this huge intersection of failure that led to the confirmation of Clarence Thomas\nI think we have a similar opportunity to get it better and get it right this time but we have to be able to change our our framework right now that the real struggle is to try to make it clear that the claims that Kavanaugh is making that attempt to rally\nThe family a circle a around the the endangered now a white male with all of the dog whistles all the way to the bullhorn that you heard there I worked hard I didn't get a handout 'em all the way\nTo to Graham basically saying what's really going on I'm a single white man and I'm not going to shut up anymore we don't we don't have\nThis is Ninety point one W.
