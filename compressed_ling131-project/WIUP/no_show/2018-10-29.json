are listening to your alternative source Ninety point one W by UPS bend in Indiana [noise]\n\nHello I'm In a while and came to host a white collar crime called\nTo Dan joined as usual by then the ... the co host of this program and ... special droughts Ronald Macri who is president of Brown University in Rhode Island\nWelcome to the broad cause like you ever tried to have you played today we're going to talk about universities education and whether we're preparing\nStudents for the world that they're very intimate or are we preparing for an old concept of what they should know in order to go out into life\nI'm into all its run that question in many ways during the next ... run or how do you feel a student is well prepared for today's world your students leaving Bryant\nI've been talking for several years about the fourth industrial revolution which has already begun this is the change massive change to the workforce in the future and we believe that our students need to have a concept of what will artificial intelligence big data analytics and quantum computing due to the workplace\nThat's beyond the basic academic curriculum it's really thinking about how to use artists\nWe now see tell us a little about buying a it's a private university law for video Nevada City and it specializes in business but don't it's certainly\nCorrect that we've been in a\nIn a business since Eighteen sixty three no pun intended and we started in a business specialty school but now we're university we have a College of arts and science which is an excellent program we have health care facility graduates for physician assistants and we have an excellent\nCollege of business we're about uh thirty six hundred undergraduates about three hundred graduate student so we're about four thousand a person institution private\nUh we are housed on five hundred acres just been rated as one of the top twenty five best campuses from a standpoint of the artistic quality and the the quality of the trees and the grounds and it's a great place to go to school\nHow do you feel that you're turning out the whole matter and all the whole woman are ready for this world\nWhere we have done that purposely our our purpose has been to educate students but to inspire them to learn so that they become innovative leaders with character around the world\nAnd we had been working not just on academic excellence which is the hallmark of any academic institution but also as you point out educating the whole person making sure that they're you know ... making sure that they have character and making sure that they're ready for this technology driven\nEvolution which is coming uh the big data in a in a moment I Want to ask you about innovation Linda Ryan we're to\nThe liberal arts making on the whole man or woman and equipped for the challenges and the twenty first century technological world\nI just spoke to a several hundred prospective students over the weekend and I said the future requires that you have both the right\nOf critical thinking that you have the ability to understand art and music but it's going to be very analytical in the future and so you've got to have a concept of math you've got to be able to understand how this big data influence decisions\nAs you think about history so we think it's very important to double both right and left arts and science as well as professional\nAnd liberal arts of course are really important for your association later on I Know that when the American businessmen and women go to Europe you know the conversation often it's not about business it's often about what places he's seen what books in the red\nAnd go to a country like Ireland or the first thing they ask you what are your books and said that is really important you know to make sure that you don't get that one side of the person that just is so well versed\nIn their technological area that they really have ignored the other side\nI Would drink a little issue with you or the implication of real question and that is that\nSomehow reading books are sufficient in society reading books is to fish in with yourself well of course it's a very personal experience and old should be and and where it comes to neither do I have not taken life's journey alone troops they held the larger issue than whether you fit in with the Irish\nNo no I shared a winner share that Journey Through the art and that is really when I'm Talking about\nAnd frankly I Would say I've met a lot of CEOs allowed leaders of countries lose government they are more than one dimension and watch what we want our students to be more than singularly knowing that an accounting debit to go left critically writes we want them to be able to discuss plays art history books or the world which they live\nLanguages nine languages and did you have when you do teach many languages at the school\nWe do teach and and we one of our largest measures isn't national business which requires you to have for years beyond based\nYour name was ... yes indeed Arabic with with my major but ninety's not anything like that it came in a good time it came to hearing the energy crisis and so that was a natural\nFit for me to move from university into the business world with and and it's been sharing wasn't at that point but at least I had that language background that enabled me to do\nThat Arabic and Mandarin there too critical language skills which mattered we actually have a school in China I just came back from China last week\nAnd uh we're teaching we're one of three schools are up and running in China teaching English teaching our curriculum or as challenging as tough to do business in China sometimes but it's been working we graduate our first class this year\nAnd I'll be back in June but we need to teach our students how to\nSpeak Mandarin we need them to understand who we are so that the as we are competitors economically or that we're able to understand we're also human beings let's go back to innovation\nOn a lot of schools now are teaching innovation is a teachable or all natural inventors natural uh helps wasn't education\nI think the word innovation is one of the most ubiquitous misunderstood words in English language right now it's on every college campus every business we've actually defined it\nAnd we've been working on innovation for almost ten years and what we think it is is\nFor students to understand there are certain qualities that if you're going to be an innovator which is going to be required whether you're an entrepreneur or whether you're working for a company\nYou need these skills UD curiosity creativity just like the Wright brothers had they didn't develop that plane because they just thought about it one day you need to have collaboration working in teams the person who discovered the first computer it went to the basement of Iowa State it was\nWhere you have three people you have maybe three different ideas you don't pick one of the three you take the best of the three and you develop the fourth which is the solution for the problem you also have to have connectivity that means you have to bring people who are different to the table to work\nAnd finally what is very hard to teach and we're working on it how do you have the perseverance to overcome failure every entrepreneur every person has ever been successful has had failure and you have to overcome that a\nA very large inhibitor almost everything absolutely in every aspect provider goes back to those folks and uh where you and I was one of the life lessons to learn from\nIt really helps to develop a community where you help one another to succeed\nAnd like to get back to your on the idea of design thinking and students working group and I know that I'm\nRyan has kind of particular program that's really quite unique this idea when the wind can you tell us something about\nWell we just signed it early in their career they need to understand the basic ideas of solving problems with design thinking skills much like IDEO teaches corporations yeah and so we bring them back for three days a boot camp\nIn January before everyone else comes back we send them out on buses there thirty people in a team [laughter] each team has five cohorts each cohort each team of thirty has a faculty senior a staff\nAnd alumnus who are assigned to them and they work with them\nAnd we're interested to just how they how they operate\nThe ideas that they get on how to solve a problem it may be how checked into a hotel it maybe how to deal with library checkouts but to actually go and observe the comeback work and then they make these pitches to alumni and business people who come in and listen and it is transformational\nOnce they get this then they discover how to use this during their four years\nIssue and we think the idea is not just to assess at the end of the freshman year when they take the idea of what the end of the course right to assess at the end of two or three years and then assess at the end to five years after they're out of school and seek aren't these ideas and concept I might\nThrow in there if if I may or the idea that you have the courage to defend your own idea yes especially in a group yes otherwise that idea doesn't come out\nYou are very interesting man who didn't just a ride on this um become president [laughter] as one wonders what you were told that made you present the university because you were unable office up a law up\nAnd member of the United States Congress for three terms and uh uh now you're president of the university that's a pretty diverse background at what point did you think higher education would backing you\nFrankly I never thought it would Beck and me until I got the call I used to always teach and after Congress I taught when I was in Congress with the then president uh Bryant and he called and said I'm about to retire give any interest in being the president following me and I said I never thought about that and I think that's part of life you you\nWork hard do the best you know is it that doesn't ask congressman you've escaped the trap of lobby most asked congressman I Know I'm sitting and watching and working for all operating the round lobby shops and you you left Congress and said\nThank you I've done my best guess and went in different directions\nWell I've always said if you're given the choice between billions and lock take luck [laughter]\nFor me it was just lucky I got this call I pose it was something that I'd done always taught my wife had taught in college and so for us it was like wow this is a unique opportunity\nUnusual from the ... range and just let the TV [laughter] um and build on radio can yes edits and a and also you you're a avid golfer a squash is a great game\nHas sports talk show anything that has helped you in life\nI think it has taught me how to fail how to lose be gracious especially squash yeah you have every point that you win or lose and you I'm a I'm a former ... many enact one but I did play it for several years and loved it actually\nI was not recorded that I'd never been particularly good at during the\nAh sports involving a bowl a which has caused me to be you know sort of critical of sports that involve we'll split the smoke smell smuggled\nInto a\nNew like sports that involve bowls and did I Do I Do learn life lessons from playing sports\nI I learned blind in tennis which is I like playing single [laughter]\n'cause I actually had my sister is that's my job both partners in the late may it kept the family home when we weren't playing doubles it was good\nI think one of the great aspects of title nine has been to encourage women to play sports yeah and so when they're walking into a boardroom when they're interviewing they're competitive there there used to being in an environment where you have to give and take and plays a team\nAnd I'm seeing this I've seen is all through my college years it's terrific at Bryant or ...\nI think it's very important ah where division one or we make sure that we recruit good students so I'm On the board of the NCAA and see what's going on and then it's\nThan the entire average student body we had sixteen students who had a four oh in their season we had the volleyball team who won their league had an average of three point for\nThis is remarkable and it's because these kids have learned how to not only compete at the highest levels but how to work hard in the classroom\nYeah that was very old tradition in university sports here we have this caller athlete that's on the road scholarship for us students with based on a scholar athlete on\nAs a cesspool drawn roads the imperialists KFC is yoga yes indeed it was a major in that part of the world where you just English and so I don't know about all day on the roads and he wanted to turn out these perfect English gentleman who would\nVolunteer his idea cricket players that went to Oxford no but that would involve idea of empires rise carry the union jarring around the world for it and it was a long time before\nOther people were allowed in I think Germans were allowed internationally and he had to do was setting it up you had this ... after a nine hole jammed some the day off Dr James and a ... it's been one of the most successful in doubt programs and the history of the worry\nThe ... tell tell us a little bit about it about what\nThe relationship to Tupperware is to Bryant University\nEarl Tupper who founded the plastic material uh was leaving the country to go to a Costa Rica and he decided he needed a tax write off and he knew Brian was looking for some land and so he called up a a lawyer who's now deceased and the lawyer told me the story said\nLet's give this land to Brian and or they're looking for a new campus in the nineteenth\nFrom Brian threatened to Bryan College buddy was located in province adjacent to brown brown wanted the land that was right on ... street and the buildings and so this became an opportunity for the schools to move they got a twenty five million dollar hide grant Nineteen Seventy one built this first\nSeveral buildings today we have a five hundred acres and uh we haven't had enough campus\nWell as a former congressman what'd you say when the student students as a I wanted a career in politics [laughter]\nI tell them it's a very difficult time right now that you must understand that your privacy or life is not going to be as as easy as you may think and you must really ask yourself\nAnd it's a concern for me because it is not something that I can easily tell people you should do this I had never run for Congress when I or any political office when I ran the first time I did it because I served in the navy during Vietnam I saw was going on I said if I could ever get the wash and I'm going to see if I could make a difference\nIn how we deal with our military and our foreign policy today it's tough uh\nI'm Glad you mentioned that the privacy issue I think we deny ourselves as a nation a lot of talent\nBecause of the intense scrutiny\nThat has nothing to do with the job that Senate whether you had to drink when you were in college whether you\nDated somebody all of these issues on that really cut off a lot of town and a lot of people who would otherwise go into a rose or I don't know what we do about it so al ... the media scrutiny as much tougher than the ... wife is covered Congress\nQuestion uh with the ah social media out there people can put anything up on the the the sights of these sites or maybe ... maybe\nWe have a problem I also do outdoors a Dodgers\nAll the time we have today thank you so I'm always reminded weight but I didn't even on the program that thank you very much we will be back on the same stations next week and meanwhile you have one view this and that previous episodes on our Web\nSite at W. H. chronicle dot com it's also on the menu and various other\nInternet sites until then all the best Joe's [noise]\nReally require\nComing up later on the Allegheny Front the dream of the chemical boom in the Ohio Valley ... [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSo we know a little bit more about what two of the candidates in Pennsylvania's race for governor think about climate change\nBut what about the many other candidates on the midterm palate to find out about their views on climate change and other environmental issues public source a news outlet in Pittsburgh and the Allegheny Front sent them a survey\nWe emailed six questions to each candidate that will appear on the ballot in Allegheny county including statewide races and receive responses from Nineteen if something\nTo talk with me about the results Oliver more than the environmental reporter republics courses here he'll ever high so let's just sticking to somebody\nChange why or why not and if yes are we doing enough to address it so a couple of the libertarian candidates were skeptical about science regarding the scope and severity of climate change and the libertarian candidate who did think it was a pressing problem said maybe not surprisingly that private industry should be addressing it\nBut what about the rest of the field\nThe consensus among all the Democrats in uh the Green Party candidate says that the science is reliable and we should be doing something about it especially with the Green Party candidates they have like a really ambitious agenda they want to\nPut a lot of money into green energy they want to limit fossil fuel use in what the decentralized grid so instead of\nBig coal power plants you have you know you or someone in your local community you might have a big I'm a solar panel or some sort of\nWind turbine and that that energy could sign the energy in your neighborhood and this would create this big Web of energy that could be the main source of power of they want to tax the fossil fuel industry and I are pushing to sort of long\nProposed severance tax so doing things like that to to address it um the a lot of the Democrats also agreed with the science but tend to be a little bit less specific on exactly what they wanted to do to increase action on climate change\nOne of the big regional questions is about Shell's editing cracker plant which is being built in beaver county and the question was what do you think will be more important for the long term health of the region the jobs that will come from the shell I think cracker plant or the air and water pollution stemming from his operation and why\nAnd a candidate for state representative in the sixteen Robert Massie a he's a Democrat and he said I disagree with the premise of the question I don't think it's an either or proposition and that sort of thinking has helped cloud the issue because\nAnd I thought it was interesting in general how from the right and the less they both often decided to try and invade this idea that there's a trade off between the environment and industry and on the right it was because\nYou know in the industry is already doing what it should be on the environment and on the left it was because that they thought that there's lots of potential for green jobs and that green jobs that are going to make it so that there's not really an environmental trade off if we just invest in that\nThe right liberating their candidate started the more conservative candidate and I think there's a couple of things that are interesting about the cracker plant in particular a lot of the candidates are particularly the mainstream candidates like Senator Bob casey are really pushing the jobs he\nWanted to really emphasize that he was a person pushing for this and didn't even say anything initially about some of the potential environmental impact\nAmong a lot of the other candidates that were really supportive of the jobs they tend to at least emphasize that it was important to regulate the missions that they weren't emitting any pollution that they shouldn't be admitting\nI think one of the things you you mostly emitted from the people that were in favor of the plant was they didn't really talked about climate change because if\nThis plan is also going to increase it a lot of greenhouse gases in the area and they didn't really addressed that rats about slightly under half of the Democrats were kind of opposed to this ... like when you add it up all of the environmental cost that it wasn't worth it for the six hundred regular jobs that you're going to get ...\nAnd while there with no specific question about fracking within six questions that were asked many candidates did mention natural gas tax or the way to better fund the state's department of environmental protection\nI think one of the things that's really interesting in just in terms of who responded so we didn't get any responses from other Republicans and in a way I think that really obviously reflects how important in some ways the environment and addressing these environmental issues are to their concerts\nThe general assembly and the governorship all three of them at one time since Nineteen Ninety three and then only for a year so even among the Democratic candidates when you look at the specific proposals that they did have\nA lot of them tend to be ones that have come up a lot but there's been no traction so we hear the severance tax again and that's something that's come up again and again but hasn't had any traction so there wasn't a lot of new ideas about compromise or new ways of bringing forward\nA proposal that might actually get some traction so I think a lot of uh what\nWe get when you're choosing candidates as well if we choose to Democrats we know that these are their values but we don't necessarily know exactly what we were beginning in ... on the other end except for maybe the severance tax might come through\nWe mentioned Republicans and no Republicans responded to your class ... what do you make of that did anyone in their offices tell you why they didn't respond I Know you follow it up the phone calls\nSo I got a couple of emails saying yeah we are going to get to this but then just never I'm never did get a response I mean part of it is just there are a lot fewer Republican candidates a lot of these Democrats are running unopposed but we did have about Fifteen that we reached out to and didn't hear back from any of them\nAnd when you look at the surveys of the issues that people care most about among the large chunks of the population the environment it's always like fourth or fifth there are a lot further down the list in first and that's among the Democrats who are thinking about labor and jobs and so\nI'm the one thing that I think is interesting that is a little bit surprising to me is that one of the core constituencies in this election that everyone's paying attention to this idea of suburban moms that women in the suburbs are gonna be a really important decider and how this election is going to go both nationally and locally\nAnd we do know that a lot of those women really do care about the environment they care about parts of their kids and and pollution and how healthy their children are\nMaybe this election don't make a difference and maybe Republican candidates in the future if those voters come out\nThe Green Party candidates did have a lot of ideas but a lot of them were very far to the left of what a lot of Democrats even are comfortable with democratic voters are democratic politicians\nAre a lot of the emphasis is on really investing money into green energy and so there's some really specific ways you can do that and one of the specific ways\nIs increasing the subsidies at the state level it's currently set to increase sort of slowly the amount of money we give to green energy and so there's some puzzles that you could to just increased that a little bit faster that's one of the main strategies and then the other main strategy that a couple of candidates brought up was setting the really big ambitious target into the future like\nWe're going to have a hundred percent renewable energy by twenty fifty I'm One of the other things I thought was interesting it was like we so we asked them a question about whether or not we should subsidize\nCoal power or nuclear power or or green energy just following up\nOn this I mean that's a really big issue locally because there have been proposals by the Trump Administration to subsidize\nCole or subsidize nuclear because there are local coal and nuclear plants that say that they're going to close without this additional subsidies and one of the things that I thought was really interesting especially among all these liberal candidate says very few of them called out coal\nIn I'm not sure if that's because in this area that there's just a sense that you know you don't want to speak badly about a an industry\nThat's long held an important place here but we ... we do know that the elimination of coal and the way that natural gases out competed Cola's been one of the biggest booms to improving air quality in the region and lowering a climate change emission so there was only a few candidates it said\nYou know that really made any specific effort for saying that that is something we should focus on\nOnly the Green Party and libertarian candidates for governor and lieutenant governor responded to the question if you didn't hear from high profile candidates like unfettered men I'm Jeff Bartos Tom Wolfe and Scott liner yeah\nOutspoken proponent of labor unions used recently when there was a proposing to strike he he was out in front speaking about that\nAnd when you look at his website you see him talking a lot about jobs and reinvestment in trying to do things to bring back economic vitality to the area it doesn't really mentioned on its website the environment that much so I guess it's just not an issue that he's focusing on that you know that's not his priority\nDo you think that the responses that we got our eliminating for voters will they change anyone's mind or provide a benchmark to hold politicians accountable after the election\nThe biggest advantage I think what I saw from the collection of responses and it's kind of a litmus test of where we are what are the different ideas that are out there\nBy UPS them idiot up\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] in the in the in the in\nOne of these now with the movie ... was the ...
