could function and the restoration has been painfully slow\nThe coalition of groups also urged the agency to convene public hearings in Puerto Rico so that commissioners could hear directly from Puerto Ricans on how their lives were impacted by the lack of a resilient communications infrastructure [noise]\nBut the conversation around communications in Puerto Rico is not primarily one of petitioning the powerful\nIf anything the hurricane and the inadequate federal response have made clear or the need for other kinds of work and other places that can give people more power over their communications rights as part of the fight for all of their rights our next guest is\nShe's just back from the case and joins us now by phone from Brooklyn welcome to counter spin steel thank you\nWell when we talk about communication failures in Puerto Rico after Maria we're talking of course about\nPeople who couldn't check on their family and friends because phones weren't working failures that may have increased the storms death toll of at least three thousand new research that as many as five thousand human beings\nThe work you're doing it seems to grow out of recognition of the full list meaning of communications technology and storytelling and how they meet\nSo what were you doing in the case then what does or doesn't it have to do with events of the past year\nWell first off I'm I'm from Puerto Rico originally I was born there but I was raised like many of my folks were raised in the states but I've continued to have a very deep connection with port don't take off and so in the past few years my emphasis has moved to trying to figure out really tangible ways to support\nThe process of ... for for the call because I have been working in media for a long time prior to on this work I worked at global action project which is a huge media\nSocial justice organization so I work with young people and creating collaborative\nFilms that tells the story of what\nTheir issues are and how to resolve that and so I come from a background of storytelling myself on being the importance of storytelling not just\nTo get our stories out there but also as a way to build community and so\nI moved into this work of technology and I started resilient just technology it as a way to kind of garner all of the things that I've learned and the people that I've been fortunate to work with to see if I could leverage all the different things that ... from me communications and conferences which includes not just the communications but ...\nThe idea of communications and so I was looking to leverage all of these different ideas for organizers in the front lines of racial economic and climate justice movements\nAnd so I've been working\nHere in New York with New York city communities who are building local networks wireless networks for use in emergencies and for community organizing and so I really wanted to figure out how to use that\nWe've been speaking with today's ... director of resilience just technologies thank you so much today so that's the only all for joining us this week on the counter one\nThank you so much for having me\nSecond Monday of October has passed and listeners may have noticed that there was last in fourteen hundred and Ninety two\nHave officially changed the day's name to indigenous people's day and acknowledgement that Columbus his legacy of mass murder rate invasion and enslavement is nothing to celebrate\nChallenging the glorification of someone who did such horrific harm is welcome but changing the name of the holiday might give some the impression that that harm which is ongoing has been addressed and that wouldn't be just untrue but unhelpful\nOur next guest is among those asking that even should the whole country go along we think more deeply about declaring indigenous people's day a completed intervention\nAm Russ Solomon is a writer educator and community builder she's a doctoral candidate in ethnic studies at the University of California San Diego where she directs the UCSD community and Labour project she joins us now by phone from California Welcome to counter spin ...\nThank you well I read this thoughtful piece from last October by indigenous action media\nWhich states quote we're all for removing colonial symbols and nationalistic myth so long as structures such as colonialism and racism go along with them problem is they are not close quote [noise]\nIs it that gap between symbol and reality that's at the core of your concerns around indigenous people's day\nDefinitely I think those are left to work on the streets together and we're in conversation about it we're all for the abolition of Columbus Day\nAnd we were talking about at the time the movement around the country also to take down Confederate statues to take down statues of Columbus and so we're thinking about not just holidays but also the physical examples that are in our daily lives\nAll didn't really get to the core issue that we felt\nNeeded to be addressed which was the abolition of those systems with the symbols represented even though the symbol of themselves or a very traumatizing to black and indigenous and Latin next people who've been\nAt the brunt of five hundred years of colonialism has been suffering from genocide slavery federal patriarchy extractive capitalism we didn't feel that just removing the symbol really address the historical trauma\nAnd it definitely didn't address the fact that those systems still or the structure and foundation of this country\nWhere we heard it said earnestly\nYes but it's a step in the right direction but certainly in the corporate media anyway taking down the statues changing the name of holidays it's presented as a deep thrown in in a controversial wanted that you know it's still up for debate\nAnd not as part of any plan of action in other words it's not seen as a piece of something larger it's kind of the end game\nYeah that's the problem [laughter] you know is that for most of us to\nEspecially those of us and indigenous communities who are experiencing these overwhelming statistics that and to join us women are more likely to experience disappearance sexual assault murder domestic violence than any other category of woman\nOr the native people are more incarcerated than any other category are more likely to experience police brutality those are the goals that we want to focus on the end up federal patriarchy the end of rape culture the end of the mass incarceration of people's color and indigenous people the end of police brutality and removing the symbol of those things\nIt allows us to open conversation but those conversations needs to lead towards concrete action you know I think there's two ways that folks\nReact to it on the one hand like I'm not criticizing indigenous people who participate in those actions because I think for for native people who've artist\nYou know not just declaring that were still alive but we're still here but also that we have concern right that we have concerns that mattered that needs to be addressed ill\nAnd that there's something about that the occupation but it's\nEmpowering for them but the way that I see institutions and cities take up the holiday is exactly opposite of that intention every occupation it's more like this multi cultural consumerism that just puts you know the exotic says I'm\nI'm indigenous culture on display for settlers to consume and that's inherently distant tower it\nIt shouldn't be too hard for people to imagine a city on arena and recognizing on paper\nIndigenous people while at the same time death to creating sacred sites are polluting land in water or defunding social programs and so you have to think about it isn't just that it isn't enough\nIt actually can provide a kind of cover for those kinds of behaviors\nAnd in most cases it does I mean I think if you look at large cities like you know you look at the first is it just people's day was in ... California and there's been since that time were the day was commemorated ongoing desecration of alone any land\nDesecration of graveyards desecration of sacred sites marginalization of indigenous people there and and you see that everywhere else but it's been taking up\nIn Los Angeles and Phoenix [noise] you know across the board that the holiday is just you said something to make settlers feel like they're doing something without actually doing something\nWell I remember in New York Times story around the Dakota access pipeline struggle in which the reporter talked about how indigenous people want to or think about going back to what time before treaties you know which first\nOf the vague sympathy that we see that's in fact dismissive and and even in ... you know it's like oh wouldn't we all like to go back to a time as clean water when we were as one with the earth you know but last we're grown ups and we know that that's just\nSilly you know it was a throwaway phrase in this article but it seemed to me to to represent a lot about how you can\nSort of throws sympathy towards the group while at the same time to just think that they don't really have\nConcerns that need to be actively addressed [noise]\nYeah I mean I'm only had like it reinforces a lot of negative stereotypes ExxonMobil Savage but\nIt also reinforces this idea that indigenous people are are a race to be included and to be visible lives like our culture is there for a consumption versus indigenous nations having sovereignty\nAnd having the first rights to this land and also the the right of self determination and the right to protect our own people you know so it kind of a live all of the concerns that at fault too broadly the work of sovereignty or the the work of a fee colonization or opposition\nWell many people are if not literally young you know a newly aware in their own experience newly becoming aware of the deeply painful\nHistory of this country you know when it's ongoing affects and its daily reproduction and it's very difficult knowledge to hold you know what would you tell them\nAbout what it would take to make indigenous people's day campaigns and not a mere rebranding but actual platforms first struggle\nAnd I think people are trying to do this [laughter] I saw some initiative and I'm also going to acknowledge that there are many indigenous people actually working\nOne of the things is that I think if we're trying to change the relationships the social relationships that are constructed by colonialism by the ongoing process of genocide nothing crush ration slavery through patriarchy that we have to start with the truth\nYou know if you think about any of synthetic relationship is built on truth\nWe have to be able to share the actual truth of what happened and some people use the holiday as a platform to try to get those messages out that some people are trying to use it as this educational opportunity to really confront\nThe truth of what happened and and what is ongoing what is still happening but I think beyond that you know it has to be more than just education as well like our relationships with each other actually to transform [noise] and and so it does need to be part of a larger profit they\nMore than I Do that\nKnow what I like a bomb in\nNo no no no\nAnd maybe I'm wrong\nIn a number\nHere we're not we're\nBy

to step down as secretary of state and it's kind of high profile election instead he has not and so we see things going on like\nPrior to this we had the ... they're trying to shut down the polling places in a majority or\nA majority African American counties or counties that had a sizable black population so like in Randolph county um where one of camps allies try to you know recommended that seven of nine polling stations shut down um\nBefore the general election I mean that kind of interference that kind of skewed I'm I'm a decision making is what is what Stacey Abrams is talking about

these immigrants are going to somehow steal our elections\nBut he cannot point to note saying the same way that Kris Kobach could not point to all of these illegal immigrants um it is a fiction it is a lie it is a myth that as being used\nTo stir up fear and to justify the kind of unwarranted voter suppression techniques that the secretaries of state like Brian Kemp and Kris Kobach are using\nI'd like to go back to this whole issue of will do the closing of polling places or most people who really don't pay attention to what happens in polling places all of them there's a\nAnd because you talk about the impact on voter turnout of all of a sudden or either closing the bowling places or shifting of old voting place from one location to another just before an election\nAbsolutely I'm so one of the things to to pay attention to is that after the Supreme Court got at the voting rights act with the Shelby County hold her decision and twenty Thirteen\nBy the time we got to the twenty sixteen election states that had been under pre clearance and that is where because of their history of racial discrimination at the polls they had to have all of their voting rights voting changes may uh approved by the department of justice\nAfter the voting rights was got it\nEight hundred and sixty a polling places were shut down by the time we got to\nNow what the research shows is that for every chance of a mile that a polling place is removed from the African American community black voter turnout goes down by point five percent so the more you move these polling places\nThough the further and further the more and more you're able to depress the black voter turnout\nSo we had a an instance in Florida where\nAre under the guise of being fiscally responsible they were going to consolidate the polling stations will when they consolidated the polling stations but one for the black community and I can say the black community because we do have residential segregation in the United states\nSo for the one in the black community that one was moved Seventeen miles away now think about that for trying to vote and what we also know is that many in the African American community do not have\nA private cars they don't have personal transportation so they have to rely upon public transportation so when you move a polling place further and further away from the black community by that very moment that very instance is designed to the press the black voter\nTurnout in June democracy now spoken Stacey Abrams a democratic candidate for governor in Georgia\nVery can as unfortunately built a very strong record of voter suppression\nAnd yes he and I have to leave a conflict at a number of times and I think I'm I'm very well I'm not I don't think I Know I'm very proud of our record of beating him a forcing him to restore the cancel registrations of thousands of compelling his office to do the right thing when it comes to voter registration\nBut also I think it's a challenging conversation to have\nIt is unfortunately on quieter forum think attorney and how they want to harm communities and hold us back\nTo that Stacey Abrams speaking ... about her opponent church a secretary of state Brian Kemp in Georgia lieutenant governor\nCasey Cagle I also want it to turn to the Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia who was captured on video Saturday as he snatched a cell phone out of the hands of constituent who asked about\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who Purdue was stumping for senator Purdue is on the campus of Georgia Tech in Atlanta when a student tried to ask\nHim about his endorsement\nSo uh how can you endorse a candidate on my property you want to be there on a\nSenator Purdue return the phone after the student demanded it back on Sunday produced office called the incident a misunderstanding saying senator thought the student wanting to take a selfie with him\nI'm\nA professor understand if you could comment on this and as we wrap up this discussion about\nGeorgia who is voting right now I mean in some states there's no voting taking place but what's happening in Georgia\nSo first on I'm senator ... do you remember senator Purdue is the one who opened a one of those Christian breakfast is um by praying for Obama's death\nBy saying you know make your life be ended short you know quoting of a song and you know may your wife be left to I'm a widow and your children homeless and beggars so this is Senator David Perdue\n'em and Stacey Abrams is actually right that the the language that we're getting\nStoking um some racial animosity racial anxiety\nAh and and bigotry and ... they're they're selling fear as as they're as their component for why they shouldn't be in office\nAnd so what we're seeing right now is that we have early voting going on 'em and the the I I'm not sure how how risk it has been yet but I Know that um the grassroots organizations have been very active\nAnd getting people registered to vote getting people out to vote and because Stacey Abrams is has a a message of hope has a message of how the we build Georgia for all of us um\nThat is in fact stoking the fear on the side of the Republicans um because the demographics are changing so much in Georgia that the vote\nThe states to states in the country which everyone including people with felony convictions are allowed to fail it Maine and Vermont you can vote from jail\nOn in the most restrictive states Florida Virginia or Kentucky in Iowa all people with felony convictions or permanently disenfranchised Florida has the highest number as has been said if a disenfranchised voters one point four million adults in the state can't vote\nOr because of having a felony conviction send me in this\nBipartisan a coalition that has formed talk about what it's like to work with these different groups and what are the polls indicate for November\nFirst of all we don't even call ourselves a bipartisan movement we are organic grassroots movement that welcomes in enjoys bipartisan support\nWe're not leading where the partisan nature of uh of this topic or or the issue of voting what we're leaving with is the human nature you know that there are real people's lives who are impacted by these policies and because of that we've been able to first of all recognize that that some of this and franchise\nAnd urban parts of Florida and have real conversations with real people and really connect with the pain that they're feeling\nBecause of that because of that what we've seen is indicative of what we're seeing now with the hurricane relief efforts that we've always seen\nThat in the aftermath of a hurricane no one cares how their neighbor voted no one cares how much money they made only thing they see is another human being and need and that's the beautiful part of this campaign\nThat we haven't brace and we all along to for dear life because at the end we are organizing folks along the lines of humanity and because of that we've been able to get people that that that that that throw off their partisan clothes\nAnd come together as brothers and sisters are in this movement as Americans that's rallying around each other knowing that once the debt his faith is paid\nSo we can have a organizations like the tax watts Christian Coalition\nFreedom partners that stand up and say you know what it is time to bring second chances back to the state of Florida and they could do that alongside the ACLU or organizations like Advancement Project I'm I'm alliance for safety injustice and saw the rights restoration coalition\nThat is to me the most beautiful thing that we're witnessing here I Believe that we are becoming a shining light for the rest of the country about what's good when people can elevate themselves above partisan bakery above racial discourse\nAnd connect along the lines of humanity for the good of all people\nAre able to move from Florida to another uh another state that's also\nA a scene of a disproportionate targeting other racial minorities the Supreme Court has ruled that will allow the state of North Dakota to enforce a new voter id requirement that will make it harder for Native Americans to vote during the midterm elections\nBut this has already rented many tribal IDs invalid since many Native Americans who live on reservations depend on post office boxes to receive their mail or the law could make a big difference in the close race between democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp and the Republican challenger Kevin Cramer\nOr the race is expected to help decide who controls the Senate you talk about that as well\nYeah so the north Dakota voter id law has flown under the radar relative to Georgia but it's just a serious because the way this Republican voter id law is written is that most tribal ideas are not going to be accepted because they do not have a residential address in them\nMany Native Americans live in rural areas on reservations they don't have address as they get their mail at the post office there's nothing wrong with that\nBut there's probably civically written to not allow\nPO box is count as an address so what's happening now in North Dakota is that sounds of Native Americans could be disenfranchised by this Republican voter id law according to federal court statistics twenty percent of eligible Native American voters don't have\nThe correct I D\nAnd that means about five thousand Native American voters might not be able to vote in the next election and there were running out of time to try to get them the correct ideas right now I mean we're basically twenty days away from the election and\nHeidi Heitkamp only won her first race for the Senate by three thousand votes with strong native support now you're talking about a much larger percentage of Native Americans who could be disenfranchised so this one voter id law in North Dakota could cost Heidi Heitkamp percent sea and could cost\nDemocrats control of the Senate so it's a very very serious situation we're also talking about the most historically disenfranchised group in this country who faces all sorts of barriers today and now thirty days before the election they find out they might not be able to vote in a critical midterm election it's absolutely shocking an appalling was half an hour if the kind of it's also particularly interesting\nTo use the word Pocahontas the name Pocahontas that's a jar attest to describe her she has now gone and gotten a DNA test which she says from Stanford professor\n... says she has Native American lineage an ancestry as she looks like she's about to announce her bed for twenty twenty a presidential uh for the ... presidential election\nBut just imagine Amy voter suppression North Dakota got a fraction of the attention of Elizabeth Warren's DNA test or Donald Trump's Pocahontas slurs and I think what we should be focusing on instead of her ancestry is all the barriers are being faced by Native Americans in this country you can go down every single statistic\nAnd you see the problems but particularly with voting there was a long history of disenfranchising Native American voters of making polling places very inaccessible of gerrymandering district so they don't have representation\nAnd that was right before an election a new voter ID laws put into place that could disenfranchise thousands of native voters to me this is absolutely outrageous it's on America and the fact that this election North Dakota\nIs tainted by voter suppression you can't reverse it and so right now people have to do everything they can to get Native Americans so that they can get the idea is they need to go with this law was specifically written it's very very clear to disenfranchise native\nAre and what are the the in terms of the fact that we're only weeks away from the mid term elections clearly\nThe Florida referendum or whatever happens there will only take effect for the next election but what can be done now in Georgia and in North Dakota or to be able to have some I\nHave a have these folks have their right to vote on before this lecture so in Georgia there is a lawsuit filed a to allow the pending registrations to go through even if you are pending registration you can show up and vote with an idea at the polls what's right\nLetter saying they have an address poll workers are supposed to accept that but we used to be very very vigilant here and that's why issues like election protection are going to be so important 'cause I'm extremely worried people are going to show up in Georgia they're going to show up in North Dakota they might even have the right documents the election workers won't be able to won't won't tell them that they're able to vote\nAnd I'm a ... ballot initiatives that have um that will ease restrictions and other parts of the country\nWell this is huge because there's a ballot initiatives in seven states that would dramatically expand voting rights restoring voting rights ex felons in Florida to making it easier to register to vote in Michigan Nevada\nTo cracking down on gerrymandering in places like Colorado and Utah and so despite all the focus on voter suppression there is an opportunity to dramatically expand voting rights in twenty Eighteen and there is the best opportunity in a decade\nTo make it easier to vote for millions of people so I think that while also lives on suppression and twenty Eighteen the landscape for voting rights could look dramatically different in twenty twenty if all of these ballot initiatives pass or even if some of them just passed and twenty Eighteen\nWell we want to thank you both for being with us Ari Berman of Mother Jones were linked to your pieces and
