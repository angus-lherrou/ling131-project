just went between the people there got over it and have sitting at a corner and I'll sit down beside him and said would you say a song on my next record\nHe said well sure I'd love to just give me a copy of it he said when you want it done and I should Tamara [laughter]\nWe'll leave it on leave it in the car not cut out tonight and they can come in and then a car did it or you know one thing you notice\nAbsolutely a must listen to it on the way home and he listened to it on a way to city or the next day and went in there and fight to cut it was over while while\nHe's always been one of my heroes I played with a lost and found for six months or back around probably two thousand two thousand one and a half to ... the best compliment I ever got from a a ban\nLater yeah well you know your sister Raj wail [laughter]\nYes it does in the Malian maybe he was able to do it so quick because you were right your intuition he just he just knew he did that song\nYeah it was meant for him
