I. UPS found what a great so what is in France will tune that was ... what do you think about that big lead Jay\nFascinating collecting sonic adventure if you will what we've been waiting for in the studio here hang on to your ... yeah me and John over here have been getting a mean the stuff we love but a lot of the same stuff we love and it's beautiful that has something experimental and like\nI said so fresh in here man thank you so much for coming in thank you so so you're you're from Pittsburgh can you tell us a little more about yourself oh when you started playing music if you could and ah what six a medic is over overall\nYeah yeah I'm see I I've been playing music since I was a seven years old I was um [noise] I was\nAt a parade with my parents and my uncle was Germany bagpipe band and\nUh I thought the the bagpipes for the coolest thing in the world so um my parents got me started taking bagpipe lessons and that's rentals started and um my dad and grandfather were in a full band in the seventies eventually my dad taught me how to play as acoustic guitar and taught myself from other things along the way and um\nYeah complain and\nVarious bands and buy myself a since then\nBeautiful so what what music did you start out with in terms of uh your first like influences what was it the your your dad was listening to what did he play on guitar\nI'm so he was he was in a full band so they played a lot of um like Kingston Trio and brothers for and stuff like that and um my dad brought us up listening to like the Clancy Brothers in an Irish folk music like that so that between the two of his pretty well steeped in cars to Qatar\nAnd and it seems like you may be the first the first generation electrons\nElectronic an acoustic instruments the beautiful thing and it's I mean sometimes I find in most of my favorite music when did you make the jump to electronic music what what I mean was there an artist that said maybe I should try this maybe and maybe I Want these since textures in here\nUm I mean ... Radiohead was probably really early one I mean are there there's a couple of albums that\nCame out in Nineteen Ninety seven that really shaped too I became a musician a radio heads of the computer that Andy Warhol has come down and spiritual lies ladies and gentlemen were floating in space and um they all used a good line of like rock music and and especially in ... or ... spiritual as well since and stuff like that a lot of drone\nYeah gotcha against some drone we're getting some uh some some nice uh ambience I'd say I was listening to some of the music you have on line by the way you can check out six and medical on line I dunno you prefer or you're certainly on bank camping on SoundCloud\nYeah a man came straight 'cause if you if you like the song enough you can buy it and the money goes mostly to me instead of somebody else\nYeah that's right the checkout bank and that's ... that's what we're always sending people in the great platform for musicians for sure I'm not at that six six oh medic and he's from Pittsburgh that'll be the defining feature you'll see a nice little round emblem there\nSo uh you've got to a most or a recent album that's just been out this month right of wealth came out a October twelfth got contracts or you can get that on his bank account to compose recorded M produced by six Americas that entirely you is there anybody else that's mine goes into this project\nOr not really this time around um other than my inlaws parrot um Pedro one track major on me\nVery cool can sorry and can people expect to find a pretty similar down to it maybe they just heard here a few moments ago a similar I guess spirit and in some similar sounds but uh the contracts are all um you know they're all start\nIt was that a song from a previous record that you have or that kind of just stay off the top of that I mean\nI'm so the guitar part is actually one of the tracks from the album a track three so long farewell um have which originally came to me on guitar and then uh the the the bagpipes and the or in the electronics after that we're all spur of the moment\n[noise] very cool very cool youthful in that place what an underrated an instrument I mean can you tell us a little bit I Know other the listeners home won't be able to check it out but can you explain to us how the bagpipes work exactly I think most people it's a total total enigma\nYes it is the most ... I mean there are actually hundreds of bagpipes all around the world um my most ... most nations have them in like Europe and Asia I think even Africa or the Scottish bagpipes which are the most common when I'm when I play have um you know one two three four pipes um\nOne is called the ... and that's where the melody comes from and that's what a papers holding their hands and you move your fingers around much like a recorder flute and then there are three other pipes called drones and they do just that the drone I'm too off\nAnd two of them just play the same note um and then the third one is an octave lower okay and that's they provide harmony um gives it kind of that is the real\nYeah much much like the same like a ... a sitar has because they they do have those droning strengths that are meant to be up or down pitched at all that's interesting I never I never I never knew that I mean to me I hear one sound and now that I think about it in my head I can hear that droning where\nBackground note there and so there are different sizes there are different types I mean you said it all over the world is there is there a hundred the varieties or\nMaybe not hundreds that might be exaggerating but definitely doesn't um I mean they actually maybe started and it's believed that they started an Egypt um I'm a like before before the Christian Era and I mean there's ... bagpipes polish bagpipes Ukrainian um you know all different sizes some of them\nThe typical Irish pipes and they use the bellows are\nBeautiful and I understand that six a medic as a exclusively recording project for you yeah okay that's awesome I it's interesting because a lot of the people that we have on the show are\nPerforming artist exclusively and they I Wish that I could point them to a bad campus that for you that's that's the that's the money spot right there yeah and what's it like what's it like recording music knowing\nThat you know immediately makes me think of a like sergeant peppers where we're not touring anymore like we can do whatever we want in the studio not worry about how we're going to present it live ... you know what I mean and everything you know they're after but for the Beatles were there were no longer touring\nEh eh\n\n\nEh\n\nEh\n\nEh\n\n\n\n\nEh\nNot\nOn\nA\nOn\nA\nOn\nOn\nA on a\nOf town on the road I learned a\nLot of trouble I\nDon't know [noise]\nLike\nA\n\nYou are listening in to ... live on local limelight Ninety point one W. I. UPS and this is your push for live local music tonight we've got Sean of six ... in the studio sharing some of his dreamy ambient beautiful songs thank you so much that was from the new album ... well\nIt was out just earlier this month police check it out\nReally cool stuff or to play\nYou some got sick that year while thank you for sharing that I feel like\nIf I Would listen to that like right before bed it would have launched mean like the mist in St ethic spiritual dream experienced in my life that was an incredible ... yeah that was awesome stuff thank you I'm I was thinking during that\nPerformance it's like what's what's your process like when you write songs like that is there is there a process and\nUm I guess do you follow it you know very strictly or is it all kind of off the top\n... like that it's it's really just like I ... I go at the moment I'm mean ... you know I Know enough which sounds really ... know enough about music that like I can kind of go with it and see where it takes me in and follow along and start off somewhere and\nMaybe have a destination in mind but just yeah I don't know see what starts\nIs there a new a new field or you've been getting into lately or any new um [noise] and then the directional changes for you like\nI mean six a medic has been involved in things first for certain that this to be sure and the I'm just wondering like what's up next for you is there anything any new challenges you're you're taking on it sounds like you like to keep things fresh\nYeah absolutely um I have a few things going on um I have a\nA couple of things in the in the ambient real real coming out\nI'm On a Wednesday or Pennsylvania ambient industrial noise compilation and then there are also putting out like a limited run um two sided early pairing up CD so I'm I'm going to have something coming out uh hopefully by the end of the year I'm have a couple other ambient projects and then\nI Do want to get back to like more traditional songs on I have a few up my sleeve um and a few in the works with a good friend and collaborator mind Kansas Dan I'm and his wife a reckoning angel or simply going to sing on our next album and\nDo some some songs with locals and if she sings a there'll be grateful gulls\nGreat a fascinating stuff I'm I'm really intrigued by that uh I if you could say it again maybe the Pennsylvania Pennsylvania ambient industrial noise a pain\n[laughter] oh well I I like that guy that is that sounds incredible honestly yeah yeah yeah um if you go to my Facebook page Facebook dot com slash six ... um I I think I've shared\nSome stuff in the past year to about the the compilation that they just put out its for CDs of of ambient industrial and annoys music annoys a rock ...\nA what a compilation I'm Glad to hear that that's alive and well if if somebody is tuning in right now and they're thinking I've never heard anything like this before I mean they should obviously going within six a medical where else can you hear them if they've\nSomeone who's new to the field of music that's not on a on a strict be on a strict rhythm\nSure I mean I think the the probably the most obvious answer is brain you know I'm right I mean he he definitely coined the term Indian music I don't know if he came up with it um but he he has like music for airport airport's discreet music um\nAnd and they're really beautiful and they're they're really good um gateway into the more MB and stuff\nAnd you kind of started off like he did write with or just kind of cutting up some tapes and loop and things over each other is that right yeah yeah I'm a ... like it's like different lengths the loops and kind of just gets the ambient flow going off of that\nYeah yeah him in a in Robert trip to the I think it's ... I think it's pronounced for ... or something like that right yeah I was just like tape loops and um you know manual like making delays and stuff like that and and just going with it which is yeah that was definitely an inspiration\nYeah beautiful well if you check out six a medical and bank can you can hear some ambience you can hear some some rock influences some pop influences some electronic influences it's very diverse a\nVery diverse bank camp indeed so do a deep dive in to see what you find that I personally I'd check would recommend checking out the song a bus topped bus ... oh yeah cool track and that is something that really got me thinking on that cinematic route that man if I made it\nSo I made a film and someone was you know front and across town at night with like meant it could it could it could really like enhanced the mood like that and it yeah it leaves so much room for you to fill in all that stuff like I'm I'm sure that\nI thought some some weird stuff that you wouldn't have originally imagined than the the other way around as well\nYeah no that's perfect as I I Love hearing that that's great and yeah definitely um bus stop is great and a headphones recommended for most of my stuff\nAbsolutely absolutely and if you'd like to hear the recordings you could check us out or going to get them up on a W.

institutions in which Elizabeth Warren identified herself as Native Americans because as you know her critics point out that uh\nIf she didn't do it to advance herself professionally why did she do it at all and that you know even if her family were was speaking to her about her heritage\nWhat reason did she have in the moment that she decided to declare that on official documents\nYeah this is where it gets complicated for Warren so if he was sort of take at that that if you if you accept that she did not um get ahead because of this the ... the question though is when she was at the University of Pennsylvania and I believe it was eighty seven to Ninety five um I might be a little wrong on that\nWhen she was there two years two years after being hired as a white woman at the University of Pennsylvania she does something very unusual wishes\nShe'd go she has her own ethnicity\nCode changed in the University of Pennsylvania's HR system\nThat does something for me in the University of Pennsylvania it allows them to report that they have a more diverse faculty than they have and the University of Pennsylvania like all major institutions was under pressure to hire 'em diverse and have diverse faculty is so\nShe does it for some reason um she does the same thing at Harvard so when she was later hired at Harvard you know of course your age are foreigners don't transfer from one university to the next she has to refill them all out\nAnd I'm about two years after she got the job offer at Harvard and a good three or four months after she started working at Harvard and Ninety five\nUm you also saw a ... documentary evidence that her\nUm ethnicity coat and changes to Native American and that's what haver and starts routes\nDoes she didn't proactively make a change and that change was used by these two institutions to argue hey look we're we're not as bad as it may seem diversity wise because we do have this professor who was Native American um so\nYou know that certainly complicated for her you know I I'm I asked her about that and you don't have\nI don't have a satisfying answer from her about why she did it I mean she says to this day she doesn't it does not specifically remember making those changes and she says that she's thought back to that time in her life\nThat her on the matriarch of her family her her ... her mother and her mother sisters we're we're getting older and they were starting to talk more about family heritage\nUm and they were dying and I you know she's ... so what she's saying to me is that she kind of felt the sense that she has been sort of growing pride in her roots that at the same time if you think about her life\nYou know she grew up in Oklahoma she went to law school she went to um graduated from school and in Texas\nAnd now all of a sudden she sort of dressed for the first time the ivy league environment and her\nSort of character is to sort of\nDouble down on on her on who she is rather than kind of try to fit in 'em\nAt these institutions so I think that's part of it I mean I talk to people at the University of Pennsylvania who would say that she liked to identify as an okey and would use that word a lot and so you know her explanation really is that this was sort of an expression of\n... the identity that she was trying to to put out in the world but you know I think it's a fair criticism when you look at how these universities or using that statistic and particularly Harvard which was so completely lily white at the time ... was arguing that hey look\nWe have a diverse stuff because we have\nThe paper or to go to law school spokesman tells the Harvard ... and in Nineteen Ninety six of Seventy one current law school professor Zinn assistant professors eleven or women five or black one is Native American and one is Hispanic\nUm that's where the list but foreign being that one Native American uh crimson editorial from Nineteen Ninety eight refers to warn law schools one tenured minority woman\nI'm political also reports that a Ninety seven Fordham Law review piece described her as Harvard law school's first woman of color any Lenski\nYeah I mean that's a problem you know that at that and that is a problem that um that Harvard ... and and that they were willing to go out and how Elizabeth Warren as\nWoman of color and if you are the contacts at the time was is really interesting um it's\n[laughter] I mean at Harvard in Nineteen Ninety three when Elizabeth Warren was hired had not hired a single woman of color\nTo their ... their faculty they had not hired a single person there was an average two hundred year\nHistory no woman of color was hired and that didn't change um I can tell I Believe Ninety\nSeven or Ninety eight um but I Will say when they did make they're finally an African up they hired an African American woman harbor did make an enormous deal about it\nUm but I you know I think that this is where the problem cotton is Harvard was out there now without their touting her as Native American I Will say the University of Pennsylvania I took a very different approach I took I talked with a D in there and about this and he was like\nNo no we were we were not going to do that you know if Elizabeth Warren wanted to be Native American on our rules are statistics that's fine but there is no way we're we're going to walk out and ... and suggest that she was a Native American\nOf her decision to come out as Native Americans or say that uh she basically her presence of these universities sanctioned the universities allowed them to not hire a other Native Americans because they had one is that true is that what you learned\nI think that's where I got to tell them not up for her I mean I have not been a criticism that's been leveled I think when she was going into a democratic\nPrimary I'm with a you know Cory Booker Kamala Harris and with a very diverse electorate and the Democratic party she's going to have to have a very good answer for that um when I asked her about when I asked her that very question\nShe says that she no she did it was doing a lot of work to promote women and to promote minority hires but I think that that is where it becomes more problematic to for her because her ... allowing Harvard in particular to use her\nUm do you use is ethnicity claim I'm you know if you look at the statistics they they were they were arguing internally oh we're doing much better on a with minority status than\nYou know than than our own measurements want us to be doing and so sort of internally they were saying oh we're doing fine externally Harvard was still saying we need to we need to do better for the most part [laughter] so yeah I mean that is I think that as an area that that's going to be really complicated\nFinally any Lenski you've been speaking to a Senator Warren a a after she released the a DNA test and the video\nAnd you've spoken to her husband Bruce men about the effects of what this has meant a and you've covered the response to the release of the DNA test yeah\nYeah yeah and I I have and it's that's it's been a fascinating um the day is really um I you know it was I'm a\nBig surprise I think to many people that Elizabeth Warren was willing to kind of undergo this DNA test and and do it and put the results out there\nBut I also think I mean she has been her arraigned and questioned on us for more than a year and her approach to this is quite different than say Hillary Clinton I mean her idea is like well I'm I I got a tip is test well it does actually show that this is the first proof\nThat she has been able to produce that they're her family stories were true and that there was\nNative American ancestry and her family um so you know this is the first time in in six years there's been something beyond you know a a family lore to rely on and put this claim although that credit because they're saying my goodness it's so far far far far back doesn't really count\n'em and do people have to make that\nThat decision for themselves um I just I Know that this is one of those questions every time I write about Elizabeth Warren I get I Would get so many emails about why does she just take a DNA test I mean ... you know they ... they would be\nUm from across the board it didn't feel like the sort of normal um you know offer them generate a type of emails they would just be from\nCan you explain what you mean by that that that that the DNA tests are there to prove that are indigenous people a Native Americans are immigrants like everyone else why\nHaven't all bear a who's written a quite a bit about this is talk about that that's the\nIt's basically coming up with a a a narrative that says a use of figure out where folks came from originally and trying to figure that out rather than to connect with the stories I mean a ... for example one of the things that just a I Love about my own people\nIs that if you look at the history of North America we once has hunted messed it on and you think about that is an arc of history that goes back many generations that is much deeper than a test that you can use\nAnd you even suggested ... that are releasing high DNA test kind of this qualifies\nTo be president\nOr could you explain that\nSure I mean campaigns are about stories and what story are going to tell about yourself and I'm here we are three week less than three weeks away from an extraordinary election and we're talking about this instead of the extraordinary election I think just from a strategic point of view that makes no sense\nWell let's go to Jesse Ross in Seattle author lawyer member of the black sea nation or as you watch this I'm from the northwest Jesse I talk about your response\nHe represented herself but also Donald Trump and his comments ... continually right through this week talking that Pocahontas\nI'm thinking and good morning thank you for having all of us um it's good to be on this very esteem panel um you know I had a few reactions number one is one concerning the media generally\nAnd it wouldn't be nice to have quote unquote native stories native themes stories that weren't centered on white people\nUm that something that's very common whether you're talking about Hollywood dances with wolves little big man or Elizabeth Warren every single time we've seen native and mass media it's in response to white people doing something really really stupid or saving our communities\nAnd uh that's a false narrative and so it would be nice to see our our communities that are that are actually pushing for it in ... on amazing recovery\nUm relationship to economics in relationship to education in a relationship that language I'm actually have that centered around this story as opposed to around the white person and the native people being collateral to that white person I'm also a\nReaction is that um [noise] you know Elizabeth Warren obviously she wants to be an ally\nBut she doesn't want to be an accomplice meaning that she stealing still willing to make native people political fodder for her own political survival as mark pointed out you have native women\nI'm Better running historic numbers and doing historic things in this particular two thousand an Eighteen election Sharif David in Kansas\nDeb Holland in in New Mexico Paul in Jordan running for governor of Idaho but yet with all these amazing native women's stories\nThis white woman wants to center this Indian narrative this native narrative in politics around her as opposed to going out and campaigning for them two weeks in advance of the two thousand and\nWe we definitely race where we um you know condemn Donald Trump for his emotion malady and his competitor wasn't as an unpredictability was she can do the Maury Povich light spectacle revealing her DNA results as opposed to doing the actual work of a leader\nYou mentioned Jesse ... Powell and I want to turn to 'em what she said the Democratic candidate for Congress in New Mexico who could become the first native woman to serve in Congress she tweeted this week\nSenator Elizabeth Warren's DNA test confirms a family history she has long shared with the world\nAnd I acknowledge her native ancestry is testament to who we are as Americans the oppression native people have experienced over the course of our history cause many Native American families to deny their heritage language and culture and I understand why this was the case with her family\nCenter Warren has been a sister in the struggle for years for indigenous people's rights and for all of us who weren't born into the top one percent\nThe revelation of senator warrants Native American ancestry a significant for her personally and I joined her and celebrating her ancestry ah that is the code of the Native American a congressional candidate democratic candidate\nIn New Mexico who couldn't well become um the first a Native American a ... a Congress member your response to what she says\nJesse Hi Congress woman she has gotten colon it\nUm and I believe that her insurance Davis will coal occupy that title is the first native Congress people in I'm In the in the house and that's going to be an amazing celebration and wonderful wonderful event for the United states politics and the United states history generally\nFor um were you know congresswoman Holland better they typically gracious and amazingly brilliant responds in absolutes\nFind out why you know this was the year of the native woman\nAnd I'm you know Elizabeth Warren evidently wanted to upgrade herself you know beyond the style\nBut that doesn't mean that requires these mobile Maury Povich light theatrics in which they do it and disrupt a slow where you native women are rightfully getting a lot of attention politically\nAnd a lot of resources politically and do this as opposed to doing the work it's an incredibly gracious and generous response from congresswoman how and but that doesn't mean that the timing is correct number one nor that it wasn't something that you know that she necessarily thought out or her people thought out properly\nAnd your response to Trump saying he'll give her a million dollars that she takes a DNA tests now saying you know I never said anything like that\nFrom a pig I mean he's a liar so that shouldn't surprise us I think both of them for making native ancestry into a spectacle\nInto a three ring circus in which non natives and specifically white people by the way I feel completely emboldened to to posit their opinions and actually challenged native people about native ancestry Elizabeth Warren and Donald Trump both open that door and so I Believe that both of them should donate a million dollars to the\nNational Indian women's resource center\nAnd um you know because both of them helped create the spectacle and both of them have an obligation to native women I Believe\nWe're going to break and come back to this discussion or where talking to a Jaffe Ross author lawyer number of black feet nation speaking to us from Seattle, Washington how sky with
