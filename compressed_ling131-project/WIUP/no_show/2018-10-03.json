know that I\nRead all about [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWe all have a Media Project we will or when we're happy to be underway with you today I'm Rick Smith editor of the times union and we thank you for joining us here with me today Ira fest spelled publisher merits his men who long ago for a long time I should say ran the daily Freeman in Kingston New York long ago in a faraway place [laughter]\nNuts so either way duty Patrick of the New York press association formally editor of the daily gets that in Schenectady yeah I'm always glad to be here well it's just wonderful to see why we give it another view after the euro zone yeah yeah the if you still feel that way ... brown head of the department communication at the communications\nWith S. at the college they rose how she is ready to communicate and you're ready to communicate she gets communicating and we're the Media Project Allen is out as we tape so we will be making are we alone without the actors are talking let's see if we can give you some insight not withstanding\nAs we look back over the last couple of weeks obviously the dominant a news has involved Supreme Court nomination of judge Kavanaugh\nAnd is really worth assessing how the media has handled this very controversial issue in which the nation's seems\nGet partisan divide on this and it seems if you look at the commentary on cable TV that there's been a divide in the way it's been handled so any general assessments of how this is as gone\nWell you know if we're going to judge amount and kinds of coverage based on what's on cable TV we run the risk of forgetting what the rest of the media landscape is but because cable television is so dominant that it's hard to ignore and and as is typically the case with cable television\nWhether it's the story or whether it's a missing airliner or whether whatever the news of the day is\nThey're just gonna run with it all of the time perhaps understandably so because they have different programs on and not everybody is watching all the time but if you uh do nothing but watch cable news it's coming out of your ears and I believe ... disproportionately cupboard\nYeah it's the mellow drama I think of cable news that distorts are frame of reference when we're dealing with is very important issue we don't look at the real issues at play here about women's role in society and people's reaction to sexual harassment allegations\nThe other thing I found really interesting is how the words people are using we're hearing the word accuser rather than a woman who's maintains that she's been the victim of sexual assault very\nGood point in so many instances we're being encouraged journalists use person first language like a person is not an addict it's a person rather we describe someone in that situation as a person who has used drugs and that's very interesting instead of calling her an accuser\nThe accuser the accuser yes that short hand you could just as easily say a woman who said she was sexually assaulted right\nI Know that doesn't sit in a headline that might be more appropriate and it's important that we are thinking about the words that reporters and editors are using because those words which I say a lot matter this conversation\nWorld we used to use a wheelchair bound when we talked about people who use wheelchairs but when the ADA came around then we changed the language to say someone who uses a wheelchair the same person first kind of language so it seems like that's moving forward when the media is deciding how to name things\nI thought the most interesting media decision journalistic decision and I had stopped me if I go to any of these facts wrong but the story that the New Yorker ran on the second victim orange user\nAnd the New York times which was on the story but chose not to use those are the New York times believing that it did not have enough to go with the story how big a century the same information that the New Yorker head and the New Yorker did go with this story right I have that right\nThe article but yet the article I wrote unfair Owen Jane Mayer who you know have written significant I mean they're bylines carry credibility\nAnd it's an important factor the decision by the New Yorker had to do with the fact that she was willing to come forward just speak specifically\nI think personally and the times decision was made in a somewhat different time context I think the New York ahead a little more time to develop it and therefore got a little bit deeper into the story you might remember correctly\nExactly in the New Yorker had the ability to talk to the woman who was making these claims they New York times didn't have access to that woman and that was a key part of the story\nIt was interesting that the conservatives are those who are very strong advocates for Brett Kavanaugh tried to turn that into the fact that the New York times didn't think this was the story that was not what was happening that they just didn't have enough to run all of a sudden they liked the failing New York times that\nIf I was actually about the New York times doing its job and recognizing they couldn't confirmed the story and when the time's couldn't confirm the story that was the end of that they couldn't choose to publish a story they couldn't confirm\nLike it's a little different from the a controversy with\nThat seems to have been an NBC cold feet\nDecision well they claim they didn't they didn't have enough but at the same amount that they had was ultimately published elsewhere so but I think to Judy's point\nThe New York times never said the story wasn't true right contrary to what the conservatives say they did they just said we don't have enough to go with on this story it had they had the interview with the with the accuser they probably would've run the store\nAnd one of the difficult things that emerges is that once a story like this is published by the New Yorker it becomes a part of the conversation it becomes newsworthy and itself who we put that story on the front page of the times union and\nI had an attack from a reader who said you published a story that the New York times didn't think was good enough even so left wing New York times wouldn't publish it and yet you did but of course the story is out there and it becomes a part of the news even if you didn't think that the New Yorker had enough\nContent to publish\nIt becomes an element worth publishing in this context\nBy the way you know that the joker going around is the last thing that a CEO wants to hear as his secretary buzzing him in and say Ronan Farrow is yeah\nAbsolutely that used to be Mike Wallace yeah [laughter] it's worse now Ronan Farrow absolutely\nYou know one of the interesting developments also was a Supreme Court nominee giving an interview in real time to a TV network or Martha ... of Fox News did the interview she's by the way a an upstate product a graduate St Lawrence university I just passed that allowed\nTo get a fine job with that in ... yeah she was thought fall and measured and she asked probing questions I thought that she asks questions that were relevant and she didn't like the judge off the hook I thought she conducted herself professionally and like a true middle of the road reporter with now\nAbsolutely that's why he was position that Fox\n... but there was a lot of blowback here to how Guerra Supreme Court nominee go out in the public and talk to a reporter I didn't have a problem with that I I think that they should be more available I don't think it demeans the court for potential justices to talk to reporters to get more out about\nWho they are and what they're doing of course this was a controlled setting and there was a motive behind that but\nI think the interview process for Supreme Court nominees needs to allow more probing by the news media\nYes interesting late so of course what\nShe didn't ask because it wasn't the context the interview and what he would not have answered would've been anything about his judgment about legal issues the same questions that he wouldn't answer for senators during the confirmation hearing\nShe wouldn't even ask him because we know we're not going to get a real answer so it was not all illuminating about what kind of a judge he would be on legal issues if he's on the Supreme Court he was only limited to the very narrow area of\nWhat happened and what are your opinions now in saying that this did not happen\nI Would imagine we've all had the same experience whether it's the Supreme Court which we have not had the experience but when we've interviewed county court candidates city court candidates\nThey are very quiet on any kinds of opinions regarding judicial matters and I it's it makes it virtually impossible for us as an editorial board to assess them and I don't know how the voters assessed them other than looking at what the initial is next to their name visited ours they\nAre the extensive ... precedents they sat and that requires a very legally tuned mind that can vet through precedent setting cases and determine what the judge ruled them why and that's an exhaustive work\nGrabbed the attention the readers and boosted circulation\nAnd after all comics aren't I mean I hate to break into becoming so not true [laughter]\n[laughter] what\nThe reason you're raising this is because there's a newspaper in Washington state that is running serialized fiction yes\nHere um and uh it's a it looks like a great piece and I can I can almost imagine it and I'm just wondering if it might not be a worthwhile thing for us to consider or especially these days graphic novels you know this is a rowing genre which is really interesting that is kind of comic books for adults if you will\nUh and maybe that is something that we should consider in the trying to\nReshape the role of the print media at least I don't know that we certainly need fiction on the digital side of things but maybe this would be something that would build readership be interested to hear\nFrom her that folks media WAMC data orgy engine to hear what people think about that\nYeah well what is it going to cost us if we just decided to do it or we are we running experts from books to help sell a book and we get the content for a while or are we actually\nTaking a reporter are hiring somebody to do this at the same time that we're not a hiring and in fact letting go people who are covering news so it's it's a determination that may have made more sense to me when when times were better than again when times are better you didn't need serialized content to sell newspapers\nAnd the other thing is you have to make sure you're really clearly labeled as fiction because people get confused especially on line\nThe issue in the student journalists they ask us could we run poetry or could we run section and we and I I'm the advisor to the school paper and I frequently say our space is too precious to place it somewhere else we have too many stories to cover too much serious stuff going on that needs time devoted to it\nTo spend time with poetry and fiction and the newspaper I just it is a newspaper not that it's paper on line still it's a newspaper and if you you could compromise the credibility of the publication that's just my one concern though I Do agree with Judy I see value in creating reading habits\nToday we turn to the topic of the media access we've complained before about the access to the governor of New York and of course now or the president also President Trump actually conducted dispersed it I think his forces since he was elected full scale press conference\nUm remarkable show it was why wasn't it though but there is you know there used to be something called the daily a White House press briefing sometimes two a day which has gone away and they said ministry and sometimes there's only one press briefing a week\nAnd there seems to be a lack of availability organizations use organizations that are somewhat smaller like ours for example Hurst has Washington correspondence but we're not we're not like the New York times or the networks always right there on the White House won\nThe White House press briefing has often been valuable this administration simply isn't doing it you don't see Sarah Huckabee Sanders up there every day that we use the the\nWhite House press secretary corruption crime I didn't really read all about\nMedia Project as a production of WAMC Northeast Public radio wrecked Smith

to today's program of the commonwealth of California I'm Gloria to the president and CEO of the club a nonpartisan non profit public forum dedicated to airing diverse views unimportant topics of the day this week we get the Inside Story on the rise of Russia's president\nAnd the decline of us Soviet relations ever since the end of the Soviet Union nearly three decades ago\nWesterners have tried to understand what type of country Russia is becoming and how best to engage with Michael McFaul served as US ambassador to Russia from twenty twelve to twenty four years unique insight into how the Russian Federation functions\nWe invited McFall to give us his perspective on one of the world's most contentious and consequential international relationships\nBetween us and Russia and to share his first hand account of the rise of increasingly hostile and seemingly paranoid Russian President this program as part of our good ... series underwritten by the Bernard shaw foundation\nNow please join us for my conversation with former ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul\nA warm welcome to the commonwealth club I'm Gloria Duffy is many of you know president and CEO of the club and I'm delighted to be hosting the cuts\nHe is a long time scholar of Russia and the other former Soviet states he studied at Stanford\nAnd then at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar\nHe was deeply committed to bringing about democratic change in the Soviet Union as it crumbled in the early Nineteen nineties he was recruited to be a member of candidate Obama's foreign policy advisory committee\nFor the two thousand eight campaign at the end of two thousand eleven President Obama nominated him as US ambassador to Russia and the Senate approved him by unanimous consent that would be quite doesn't have all these days\nHe served as ambassador to Moscow from twenty twelve to twenty fourteen in his first book that spin oriented to a more general audience\nFrom Cold War to hot peace in American ambassador in putting his Russia ladies and gentlemen please join me in a warm welcome to the basket or Mike McFaul who is back at the commonwealth club after several previous appearances thank you thank\nYou [noise]\nSo let's start at the beginning you came from Montana you're the son of a father who is a musician and music teacher and a mother who has been a university administrator how\nDid you come to be interested in Russia\nSo did start Montana it happened with a move from a beat a beach town for most of us will meet meaningless but er when we in my junior year we moved from ... and that changed my life\nBecause uh most of my life I was born in a town called Glasgow even more obscure although there's a lot of ICBMs up there\nYou may know that area well uh I didn't know that at the time when I was growing up but it's a pretty rough mining town not a very intellectual place I Love you by the way if there's anybody from Butte here and I've learned to love you more and more as I've learned the history of that great town\nTo right now I've written a five hundred page book but most of the fifty pages of footnotes don't don't be afraid by the book and I took debate class to try to get an easy Amy my neighbor told me this is the way to get an easy and English to take the bait class and the year that I took the bait a and then later joined the debate team\nThat the topic was how to improve us trade policy and my partner and I ran a case\nOr you may remember this ancient history to repeal the Jackson manic amendment so the Nineteen Seventy four trade act as a way to increase trade to the Soviet Union or by the way later I became a a staunch supporter of the Jackson ... amendment and was quite involved in refused next and and and bringing\nThings to Jewish people that were refused or immigration to Israel in the United states but back then that was our case by the way my debate partners now senator Steve Gaines from Montana south [noise]\nWe're a pretty good but that was that was the spark and so that's what I got interested in the Soviet Union a I got to Stanford has a Seventeen year old kid and this was in the height of the early years of Ronald Reagan and it was a scary time for me\nOr so that was the first change and then before I arrived and I don't want to emphasize that before I became ambassador\nThere was a parliamentary election in December of two thousand eleven falsified kind of normal ways a normal rates five or six percent we'd we in Washington didn't think much of it\nBut a lot of Russians thought a lot of time uh and with their smartphones and Twitter and Facebook and vote ... de documented and publicize this fall suffocation\nAnd then came out on the streets to protest this election and then as they stayed on the streets to protest the ... regime\nAnd the last time you had so many people on the streets of Moscow was Nineteen Ninety One year the Soviet Union collapsed\nAnd so those two events together created I'm\nPutting needed a and a an argument for why these people protesting against him were illegitimate\nAny blame he said that that we were the ones funding them America Obama and me\nAnd so by the time I arrive that is the narrative that I arrive into in fact even before I had my first day on the job even at because it was Martin Luther king a weekend I remember vividly we we fly and you know we're all excited we we just\nSpot so house or go look it up on the Web you can take a virtual tour it's a beautiful beautiful mansion our entire house in Palo Alto could sit in the chandelier room of this place\nAnd so we're just kind of like tourists in our own house bouncing around and and you know I didn't have to go to work till Tuesday and that Monday Night on their main TV channel controlled\nBy the crumbling ran this like Eighteen minutes hit piece saying you know McFaul has been sent here to foment revolution and that narrative was basically the narrative I've lived with for the rest of my time in Moscow\nBut how you said what was it like to be ambassadors so that's the high politics but before I forget yeah I heard those bones\nAnd there's more to the mountains by the way that it gets even worse in the book but being ambassador is great and and I want to just remind you that it's not all dark so first of all just the honor\nTo serve the United states of America and Russia to be your representative their experience of a lifetime I just love that I Love that experience of of like in fact I'll tell you a story at at at one point\nThere were some death threats against me and there was some ... demonstrators showing up all the time it was pretty chaotic time in the early uh weeks of of you know pressure on us\nAnd one of my body guards said um you know the string bass or I think we should take the flag down on your cars that we could travel around a little more uh you know not being noticed and I was like Sergei come on a we\nHave this giant black Cadillac ah two giant bass Suburbans are not many of those ... on the streets of Moscow that's where my body guards travel you'd think they don't know it's us we're going to have that flag on there because I Love driving around with that flag and by the way a lot of Russians love scene that flag\nSo one just that piece was fantastic\nTrusting things is a mess or your job is to engage with different parts of Russian society and I've lived in Russia many times before maybe five years of my life had already lived in Russia but there were parts of society that I'd never experience than his ambassador I got to experience so you know\nSitting in the front row the Bolshoi theatre for\nNutcracker I'd I'd never done that before but I've done that as a basket or um uh you\nKnow meeting members of the business community people I didn't know well\nI and then the reverse right bringing Americans to Russia that we could feel proud and celebrate um\nYou know the Chicago Symphony orchestra came to Moscow when I was ... and you know the standing in front in Tchaikovsky hall with you know twenty five hundred Russians that really know their classical music by the way\nAs an American that was a great experience\nAnd and and having\nYou know Herbie Hancock at my house like that was my job you know and I got like six hundred of our best friends because the ... you know the ballroom was big enough I could have six hundred\nFriends on my house so those are good parts of the job as well\nSo you will rise to this Eighteen minutes hit piece you and as I understand it you had decided that you are not going to compromise your values\nIn order to uh you know go do your job as ambassador you are going to continue to talk to people yes to promote human rights to have\nPeople to people contact and San yeah\nSo you did that and the reaction to you turned into even greater harassment right and dangerous harassment at some points yeah so can you describe a little bit of what transpired and and then we'll get to the next part which is he stood up to some of that\nWhat was what happened that well so first of all I Want to be clear on this it wasn't my values only it was the Obama administration's values\nAnd and that's something people need to remember like you're part of a team as you know well you you don't get to like be a solo artist um and I love being part of the team by the way that was one of the greatest things about being in the government\n... as an academic it's usually just me sitting in front of the computer writing by myself writes a Anya is in the front row here sometimes yeah fantastic research assistants that help you are but most of the time you're like working on your own and and being on the team was great\nBut back in two thousand nine we made this policy that we're going to engage society as well as the state\nAnd it was controversial I Wanna I Wanna make sure everybody understands not everybody in the Obama administration thought that that was a good idea but we experimented with it\nOr when the president went to Russia in two thousand nine um and you know imagine that was my I was in charge of that summit my first flight on the on air force one wasn't eleven hour flight that I did not sleep more that I didn't sleep at all you know 'cause I was in charge all these events\nScared to death that something might go wrong and worried precisely about this component\nBecause they won Obama spent with me get us\nDay to he had breakfast with boots and and the rest of the two he spent with students business\nPeople civil society and opposition leaders and it went great and there was no no strings\nNothing that in fact we couldn't even get the western press to write about it was such a non event but so that was our policy and when I arrived ... that I continue that policy but the the context of change radically that's the point I wanted to make so\nTwo thousand nine were in the height of the research at two thousand twelve there's a ...\nA major events and again the instrumental used by uh the ... regime decides to suggest that we were there to support the opposition\nAnd I and I want to be clear on this uh we did we did not fund the opposition we did not do that the story line was too simple and in part\nBecause of of part of the history you talked about earlier in my life because I did there was an earlier part of my life that I was in Russia working for an NGO to promote democracy in Nineteen Ninety two I was there\nInvited by the Russian government by the way I remember it wasn't meddling in their internal affairs back then we were we were rock stars back then they everybody loved us and when when when President Clinton was elected after that we even became even greater rock stars a everybody wanted to be affiliated with us\nBut that background became part of my baggage as I when I showed up as the U.S ambassador in two thousand twelve\n[noise] so there's a group of questions under the general rubric of whether Russia and let me go through a few of them is public supportive to ten leaning citizens want change reports of protests by young people how will pretend she's his successor yeah what or who comes after\nOff too many hard questions how long will stop there those are hard questions and ah I'm going to answer them but I'm going to carry it by saying\nPolitical science were really bad at predicting political change in the future\nAnd now I've been in the government for five years so is the intelligence community you know did we get the green revolution in Iran and two thousand nine right though did we get the Arab Spring right two thousand eleven though\nDid we get Russian two thousand eleven right no till we get Ukraine right in two thousand Thirteen so just we need to be humble about our predictions about what might happen in the future right\nI think the the the survey data for that suggest yes but slowly back in two thousand twelve he was he was at the lowest point need every bit as important to remember that that's why he was so panicked\n[laughter]\nDo\nYou do not\nHave the cash just the two little girls ...\n\nTo do the\nBig weekend is that a new job to try\nGet them\nCan you\nKnow the

O. U. P. Ninety point one your alternative source in Indiana, Pennsylvania now with her four o'clock shows where it's ... I have such Davis and Michael Schober the Bruce how you guys doing good\nMhm very formal there Michael and then what the world of football now um [noise] we had a kind of a sad happening on um Sunday with power I hurt in the bangles falcons game even though Bengals came on top\nOf that I kept watching videos of that and I just I cringe over that because it did not look good and what are you guys think on that\nI I don't I don't think there's still only they need him so I don't think it'd be manner like yet it's a horrible horrible injury and out of the rest of your right yeah I'm pretty sure if it's broken but uh I don't think it's going to affect them anyway I just go talk to a game which I animal fantasy so that helped me but\nYeah I Know but at the same time you just when you see in like almost like the ... George situation back a few years ago that injury just look gruesome it just looked like he broke his leg or something like that but it's just something that you don't\nI Know we're supposed to have Eliot today but he was in\n... yeah he had a meeting but I I was hoping you would be here 'cause I Know the the er last he really wanted to talk about that because he was on big hit last night he was really ranting about it and I know you're a Phillies fan says but yeah what what's your take on this the ...\nLaw or they just don't have a good team right now their defense is not what it should be for what Steeler fans are used to seeing much event but again that hasn't been like that for past couple of years and this is more mostly became a oftentimes minded team but\nI don't I don't want to say the whole levee on bell thing is what's hurting them I think it's just pour coaching by everyone was they'll have\nWell I feel like at the same time it's somewhat affecting them but not fully like there's other\nItems fat drink it's affecting them mentally but not like physical you're not in the game in Qatar can hold his own enough to where he'll be productive but I think mentally like the whole all the talk about all he's not common what to do with them I think it's time to like affect the team at the whole\nYeah with um now he says he's going to come week seven yeah by\nWhich I feel like I Know probably majority you guys think no he probably won't because he said I think before Memorial Day he said he would be there but he didn't so I honestly don't feel like he's going to come at all I Know you you're looking like you want to say something Michael but I\nHave nothing else to say other than the open courting ... folks that you love to the up and defend that watch Pittsburgh 'cause they're no longer the steel curtain are open curtain\nNo they lost that out closed doors they lost that title after ... Colombo left\nThat uh I I mean probably retired but like the pilots and I asked him to\nYeah I Know he was a strong defense of coach well defensive coordinator to be honest but I just I just can't believe how much he met almost that team to bring that team together but at the same time there corners were always garbage\nWho okay they keep butler take over for them whenever below bow last I yes I see so their act coke yeah so like\nHe's been there for at least five years four years I don't think that'd be something else like they may even just as a whole not good I don't really blame that coach so that's been there\nFor years three years in place and it's not no thing but the Steelers never had strong ... for a long time even though they don't they don't go out and like phrasing get people they rely on draft picks that hopefully they can build into\nLike do like the Packers they don't rely on frayed relations just hope their own guys can do something and stimulus Pittsburgh has a\nLike a big football like place like the history and all that silly people would want to play for them and they actually went out and spend the money on people\nThat's that's the thing about the is enormous too they're known for their defenses typically 'cause yeah they had the steel curtain was a strong defense back in the day ravens had their two thousand defense and tells him five yeah Bengals had some strong defenses throughout the years browns\nThey usually have strong defenses but it was always the off ... killed him yeah typically but we're the ... and like the ravens and the bangles recently they're often says have been somewhat better but it just seems like the defense of world is not as good as it used to be a law teams\nOr back pressuring it and make sure to lie down on a mattress get a mattress not a football field in line down on a pillow\nI knew we kind of touched on this a little bit but not with Yousef but what what's your take on this whole rough and the passer\nA rule it was bound to happen like in\nEvery sport has to adapt so players have to adapt with it like the NBA the three point line now the king of all it's like a lay up now for people so you had to adapt and if you're not they mimic shoot threes you're not going to survive on that week it's no longer power center early\nSo like in the NFL defense to have to adjust to the fact that they can no longer just lay out a quarterback due to injuries so you'd have to adjust\nWith what you're given yeah just like the corners aren't a lot we're allowed to pressure within five yards I after five yards are not allowed to like have any contact you know you have to adjust to that\nI think it was also with like receivers you couldn't really touched them after like ten yards or five you're under\n... a lot of all signs of improvement in the rules so like mostly defensible anyone's had to adjust for yeah and some can't like math to use Yemen can't adjustable\nWell at the same time I've been hearing that there's more injuries because of it now because defenses are afraid to tackle the quarterback if they get they tackled like weirdly or something they will get injured or\nLike a like a dolphin fans raiders the guy went to ... car and he knew if he put weight on him he'll get penalties when he's shifted his body but in the process of his body he tore the ACL so he's out for the year\nYeah I've seen that also and that's just not that's not fun to see what the new rule I Know it's going to take time to adjust but it just something they show implemented like starting with the ...\nThey I think I Know what to say I think I Know who's going to say can you think I mean I think if it Redskins they give you about those people know actually\nI wasn't going to I was actually going to go with my ... favorite the jail the giants too [laughter] I never before you said that [laughter]\nWhy say corn on day one of the three yeah but still early so [laughter] if you are banning can get his crap together yes 'cause mine suck don't you realize that\nYeah it's like one of the defense of lines and the division valley [laughter]\n[noise] yeah but you got to think of it this way I I just want to go for an hour and a dog and asleep in this division because honestly I I Would bet on the eagles by the same time I wouldn't doubt any other team in that division cause any one of them can take it to be honest\n... federal as history has proven that no one team has taken it twice maybe one time then\nSent us three oh three oh four oh three and four eagles back to back that was the last time yeah they're McNabb yeah yeah back in ... and Andy Reid yeah than you can go to Philly\nCowboys garbage directly is not a quarterback for them no no I'm okay with that like a team for two more years I don't care bring back Romeo Romo\nWho don't know Washington is severely severely overrated on their whole Alex Smith in Adrian Peterson all that\nThen we have the giants who I don't know like why you think you're going to do something they they play the eagles next Thursday so we'll see\n'cause I Know now I I Know we can't shut down after watching time and we cannot shut down or or do I know that for a fact what are the best run events sake one like it'll be an issue uh oh so\nSay the giants win your giants Jersey I'll get you\nA giant yeah I don't have a giant or make you were playing the federal player hits manning who at worst\nA cab that okay okay okay okay yeah\nI'll wear out if if the giants win next Thursday I I don't take it then I think it's a New York I don't remember when I wear a giants a Jersey back and find a link to a hat or something I'll watch something joined [laughter]\nI Know I knew some after if if my grim knows listening right now he no I I bet he's jumping for joy right now the here that's somewhat but\nIt's just move on to the NFC North now 'cause bears Packers Vikings in lines the when the lions right now at one and three which I don't think it's going to win the division\nOr the very first show of the year Mr Ed Davis over\nThere and you remember that had died and it was friday I said the barrel under right and you guys made fun of you may find on the ... not\nThat good that was overkill I Know he's not but they the fences awful well maybe that's why [laughter] why at the same time you have that bears with Aaron Rodgers in that\nDivision the ... the ... man the myth legend at quarterback Aaron Rodgers you're going to go against that yeah I'm Still going to the bears okay that's I'm just\nI forgot about that idea and [laughter] I'm Glad you're doing can I ask you then [laughter] after I watched\nThat a first game against the Packers I'm like ooh Washington ... ... ... what are the\n... brag about the most eighty five that's the only year they'll ever be good eighty five there we go ahead their fridge or eight or do they will get no say best player ... ... yeah well there were there\nAdd who was the bear though like Marshall ... brand Marshall\nYeah and you had Devin Hester and oh yeah ... and they got there she was in the using the yeah and now he's retired and and are there any more\nI still am Minnesota even after Thursday nights a defensive performance\nCousins that will be third place than the MVP vote and I got Vikings [laughter] wait third place yep [laughter] who's the head of a hundred of them my home and then we also know probably Garrett golf right oh\nYeah there was so sick of it as I understand joke golf\nYeah ... ... a hundred and three yeah moving down to ten [laughter] yeah you got Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady that should be on that list two and a person wants to Philly [laughter] not yet know can you give the super bowl and no no he didn't play in no picnic folds for that one right now [laughter]\nWhen you're here did you say he said Vikings to use that\nYour Packers Packers are bears key one of them is going to take it one that has to be colorblind aren't winds will get like nine seven in the like always but unless something crows have their butts and gets their butts in here\nBut I don't wear it or they just beat the patriots and just gave up when the stupid cowboy\nYeah and I mean even where it is now on to the end of the south\nWith your Panthers box falcons and the saints hate this division\nBoring [laughter] um especially with the whole ... problem yeah well I Want to get all the buck nearly no way [laughter] but uh ...\nLike what you wanna go first or [laughter] 'cause I I don't ... that going to be the leading guy\nSt downright but I don't think that I had to have their defensive players to have all the men here on opening day game yeah but they have not been really close but I got panther still I still believe in banning ... yogurt Cam Newton\n[laughter] a pampered Superman [laughter] I got to go with would be like Panthers box or scenes any one of them can take it all three of the four [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah um could take it right now I don't think bucks can't go to him is not I think the fabric advantage Amos\nBut they're going to go back down to like foreign twelve\nBut I'm the last ... I don't know no divisions just think he's as bad as yards Freeman was they last for ... for six touchdowns on them Trump is now you defend fall fence [laughter] you'd think he's really a bad how you want to do anything when they're often those events just completely just give up and\nAll it's not like the ... or any different than that but I'm the I'm going to St [laughter] that I don't blame I don't I don't like the ... I only the falcons are due to injuries that do the fact that like really don't have no touchdowns are they the league and was on his even yards but like no touchdown it's more common really is the more targeted threat ...\nAnd ...

'cause like they got to the playoffs without Leonard plane so they can now have that are\nThat is true but with the history of the martyr Rosen with the raptors you think he still will win under that system because we know the Marta rose and then I mean ... when a playoff game you really think he'll win one\nYeah heck yeah the coach and still there and all that and they have they have a young talent really talented and there's a powerful yeah and then they have\nThey do not have Tony Parker he's on the law knew I knew was left so he retired and you don't get into yet well Duncan's milk going on and he's been gone way before Kobe low\nWho's starting center\nI Would imagine Paul the song I Would imagine but I don't know does alterations of Aldrich oh yeah and I'm trying I think um yeah so I mean I think he plays power forward more but yeah but I mean they might say\nShouldn't have a small line up where he is but you have him in there too I think it'll help nice to have the expert like point guard like cow Lowry but I think you'll make up for it\nWithout ...

came from Washington recently\nUh recently yes I was invited to a speak about the twenty Fifth Amendment a immediately after some concerns that were raised a after the un press conference as well as um\nUh there was the letter in the New York times by and an anonymous White House official and a and a Bob Woodward's new book a so for various reasons I was called by the Aspen Institute to speak about the twenty Fifth Amendment\nAnd we're going to get to the twenty Fifth Amendment in a moment um you are part of this movement um called duty to warn and if you can explain or you started it if you can explain what that is and how you feel that's relevant and judge Kavanaugh's case\nYes ah it's it's quite parallel\nTo the concerns that we've had about the president in fact\nAh when the president was about to a issue or a or a nominate the Supreme Court nominee\nWe issued a letter to a Senate and a house members expressing our concerns about the signs that the president was showing of you know a lack of a\nTo make important decisions and and so we actually thought that it was\nIn judicious to allow him to nominate a Supreme Court nominee as well as to make important trips such as the Helsinki a meeting and\nNothing really came of that that was actually a different group\nThe war and I know there's a group out there that took the name and ah and call themselves duty to warn but but it came out of my conference which I organized a year and a half ago at Yale University yes that's right about the ethical question of\nBasically the the professional responsibility of the importance of restricting what we say which uh has revolved around the Goldwater rule with respect to a public figure\nAnd are suicidal responsibility to educate to promote public health and to war and when necessary and we came to the conclusion that there are instances where we do have a duty to warn in fact in psychiatry we have a duty to warn and a duty to protect\nWhen it comes to patients and the same should also apply with respect to society because the editor ethical guidelines make clear that we have a duty to patients and a separate duty to society um\nIf I may I'll I'll explain a little bit about the Goldwater rule which many have heard of a it has been\nAdult traded innocent tune to mean prohibition only but uh the original Goldwater rule actually falls under the principle that we contribute to a the improvement of the community and the betterment of public health\nAnd so it's actually a mandate to act and actually who Goldwater rush the Goldwater rule came about because uh the psychiatric profession was embarrassed during the Nineteen sixty four Barry Goldwater campaign for presidency [noise]\nA fact magazine put out a survey about twelve thousand psychiatrists and about less than ten percent came back saying\nBecause of that the magazine was sued and they went out of business but the American Psychiatric Association because of the embarrassment to the profession decided to ah to instituted as a an ethical rule not to diagnose a public figure without\nA personal examination and without authorization which I actually agree with that it just falls along\nUh the general principles of good practice but the Goldwater rule as such a state it says that one's here when you're asked about a public figure a educate the public\nJust don't diagnose that is what it says and and under the principle that it falls a set of falls under it's actually a mandate to act I'm not just a prohibition\nBut two months since his presidency ah two months after inauguration the American Psychiatric Association actually changed the meaning of the Goldwater rule\nNot just a poet that diagnosis but to prohibit any comment whatsoever about a public figure under any circumstance even when the nation is thought to be in danger\nWhich is something you're not willing to abide by now you have is that right\nBecause you live now I'm In this well known book and in a movement that's gathering more and more ... um you have question Donald Trump's\nAh you\nUm his capacity to govern and um you have talked about invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment that's interesting because recently there was an op ed piece in the New York times by an unknown person official within the Trump Administration has apparently has a was talking about the same\nAnd since kindergarten to third grade to include fourth through eighth graders the band focused on suspensions for quote disruption and defiance recent UCLA study found black seventh and eighth graders lost nearly four times the number of school days to such suspensions and white students\nJust last week it all the while I'm entry school in Decatur, Georgia\nTo teachers resigned after students complain they punish them by zipped tying their hands behind their backs like they were under arrest by police the students were four years old writer and activist Sean King tweeted this is the pre school to

brings together these voices and many more market is professor of public policy and public affairs at the University of Massachusetts Boston founder and co chair of the urban research based Action Network we welcome you all to democracy now\nAround I Want to begin with you and posit that issue honoring Brett Kavanaugh and many of his supporters saying why are you going back to high school he should not be held accountable for his high school behavior\nEven if it involves a attempted rape that the allegation can you talk about\nWhat is happening to black and brown children not just seven ten ... ten and Fifteen and as he got his forty years old in school\nAnd Amy thank you for having me on um I Would just say that we don't have a policy problem in public education and we have a values problem\nThere is a belief system that is rooted in the hatred of black and brown children that fuels education policy just think that parents are the key here has to fight because her son was being suspended in preschool\nI've seen this story over and over again in Pittsburgh parents had organized to stop the suspension of kindergarten through third graders\nI'm In New York this has been a fight in Chicago young people fought to stop this stops in Bay suspension and Chicago public schools\nHave the discipline policies are administered through our lives of hatred that they that often these policymakers would not apply to their own children um and that's why\nThat there is a belief system and and we know research says is first that are that are black and brown children are viewed as older than their white counterparts so I think we have to challenge that\nAnd not just challenge that I'm strictly around discipline but also around just starving of neighborhood school [noise] um\n[noise] I've experienced in the journey for justice alliance or across the country a black and brown schools not having pre K. services half\nDay kindergarten or not having libraries no teacher aides in the building overcrowded classrooms within in the same city their white counterparts having a completely different experience\nNow when we don't have any acrimony towards those babies that happened to be white or wealthy having a you know the things they need but the fight should be to make sure that all children have what they need not punish those schools will be star\nSo along with the suspension policies the policy of closings are starving in the closing schools has had a disastrous impact in our communities across the country\nI Want it to go now to cast Shankar I jump are now in Washington DC fat on and talk about what happened chair child on when he was four years old in Dayton, Ohio is a cat [noise]\nAmy thank you for having me on a yes I began organizing their organically or as a parent pushing back ah when my son was actually three um ah what is now known as a pre school to prison pipeline or as you mentioned\nAnd one of the things that I I did as a parent I'm you know not thinking initially that it was a a a race issue or a class issue that I just question\nUm their their policies and practices or question what was the actual normal behavior\nYou know oh he has problems you know transitioning or you know he's having temper tantrums and so what I what I saw was happening and began to realize that there was a a pathology driving a normal childhood behavior uh my son\nI then began to take a deeper look and I'm not noticed that he was the only black boy I out of only two black students in a class of Nineteen\nUm and then just the overall a teacher representation or as well at the school was overwhelmingly white the administration was all white I'm beginning to put those factors together or as I began to ask other black women or black parents asked the\nAt the school if they were having similar experiences\nUm and so once I did that I you know went to my co founder of racial justice now professor for nearly a Randall 'em and talk to her about what I was experiencing and that was basically how racial justice now was founded in her living room\nA saying that we needed to really have a response to this organize and began to shift and change policies and practices\nOf how I'm young people particularly black students and our families um were being treated or in the school at that time and so that has led to a deeper analysis and until just recently because of the work of working class a poor and working class black parents in the city of Dayton\nOhio just recently passed the law House bill three Eighteen or to ban um most of out of school pre K through third grade suspensions across the entire state and so that's a huge victory for a small organization a community based organization like racial justice now\nOr in a very conservative state like Ohio but it took years of organizing um and being supported by national organizations like dignity and schools campaign and even journey for justice alliance being supported a on the ground to be able to give that gets at work done and be able to get\nDesktop pets that you've edited a book of essays that include our gas today\nOn TALK about the studies that they've done that show what happens in this pre school I mean it's hard to blade pre school to prison pipeline how I'm ... and the more kids are suspended what happened to them as they move through the\nSure I'm thanking me for having us\nUm [noise] yes it's becoming increasingly known now that the school to prison pipeline starts in pre K. which was really shocking so these are children as young as three and four year old old who are often exhibiting a as a kiss a normal behavior\nOr jumping around in the class or acting out and different kinds of ways and you know unfortunately many of these children particularly if they're black and brown children\nParticularly if they're boys are special needs but also girls um are labeled\nA very early on and the solution is is to is seen as a pushing them out of out of the classroom getting rid of the so called troublemakers and you know this starts up on a train of labeling and you know harsh discipline that carries on through elementary school and into middle school\nAnd many studies have found that students who are repeatedly suspended in elementary and particularly middle school [noise] not very likely to fail\nTo graduate from high school either they're spoiled or they become so alienated and so far behind that they they choose to leave school on their own\n[laughter] get\nIn the mid ... was\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you live in San ...\n[noise]\nOn in
