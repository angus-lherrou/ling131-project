like our pseudo breakdown because we're not like a heavy band\nBut that one I write down right right [laughter] I'm not I don't do heavy stuff but it's a breakdown\nMore and like the like the groove being in the ... kind of way versus like the really heavy like junior guitar to drop age flat and it took us a call ...\n... yeah yeah it's it's like you can check like deconstruct\nThat morality though in a really pretty way I really liked that thank you yeah brings me back to credit for me I remember\nExactly where I was when I first heard that song just right right right and on my laptop with our hand or radio how words scenic Pandora station oh we're back in the simpler times now was an ice skating rink and all this like what is this I'm using it sounds like now\nThe future and then I get on direct me like six months I ... I just remember hearing on the radio and then sing it\nWith like my girlfriend at the time and be like yeah I totally love you so much and this is how I feel about you so much and then a year later I never saw her again [laughter]\nI just think that's what I don't know but then like I tried when I started covering it I\nI tried my best to sort of\nChanging the less of like a straightforward song and give it more of a groove and more of a feeling to it and like\nAnd it like mixed in with my usual way of trying to capture like ... I've said like so many times in the last five minutes and like my way of trying to capture just sitting down in your house on like playing guitar and just like messing around and did you\nHear the song on the radio I thought I Wonder how the sounds and then you start like Ruben with it and that's kinda\nWhat I was going forward that cover yeah really beautiful man what do you have you\n... but I Try to I uh I'm the kind of guy he was like really peculiar with this modified playlist yeah so I Try to keep everything in this like a\nNarrow call them of what I consider to be like except simply indie or accepted Lee poppy like those that are outside the way things are really\nHard what's what's something that just draws on its Indian is way too hard um do you think of any examples of that big play I'm I'm up for any suggestion of the other thing I thought I was just draws on its like peculiarity at all like its entire\nThing um and it's man I hate like\nI don't know sometimes I Wonder if I just don't get it or if it yeah 'cause I you know you'd ever want to be that guy that say 'cause I used to almost feel that way about Tyler and the creator yeah ... that's ... and then I grew to be like oh actually really appreciate this I just write like I feel like\nIn in a way that's almost like a beautiful moment whenever you listen to something and you're just like didn't hit you at All right I Know you're then later on back and you're and you're like oh my God like wow that's actually a cool\nMe most of it is a a lot of okay goes like more outdoor stuff\nOkay 'cause I'm really into I'm into like they're more like rock kind of vibe yeah and also they're more techno stuff like I like what they do when they give you the more accessible face value kind of music but then when they go out there with\nA track like a like a lot of there'd be tracks on\nOn the most recent one I'm trying to\nMake one of them is the one that has like back from Kathmandu and all those not last and I've heard all is not lost right is only striking now all is not lost is a good track but there's a beach rack that like all is lost and it's a weird [laughter]\nAnd so a lot of their like we're okay go were super peculiar and like super nice is just lay it yeah it goes above my head\nIt's like so unique gardening is so cool and\nI I still kind of fundamental shrugging\nBands like yeah like ... or send them a club I Know a lot of people like them you guys might like them but I just haven't found if if if you gotta if anybody out there it's got some\nTo to us in a club is going to change my mind

hear him now gone ...\nUp in the London ... what was that job look uh it's it's wild yeah you hear like maintenance on a golf course and you think oh I just hop on a lawn mowers most some grass and then leave right here at all or do you do not have that but it's actually like you hop on a lawn mowers and make sure that [noise]\nGet off that lawnmower and then you like grab a weed eater and they spend the next six hours each day just waiting a Ninety degree weather ... [noise] but it was a great job and I I don't know if my boss would happen to be listening but like it's an awesome job worked there again if it was financially viable for me\nHeck yeah man it's nice to get a job when and when it's like a clean yeah way to get out you know what I mean you have a great relationship but that boss forever yeah obviously is awesome\nProbably would have better bus mad because he's not he's never super like strict and it was never super like I'm your boss this is how I Will treat you I'm your boss we have to keep things professional yeah no I mean those all do or semi like the most the raunchy is people\nI Know [laughter] motives out on the golf course who knows what you get yeah yeah right right it's when in school the things that you can learn from different job you know what I mean oh totally and I was wondering I kind of wanted to ask this because I've asked you before I've had I've interviewed you on multiple occasions and I've asked you what it's like going from\nIts own like obviously you've learned a lot going from the world of a more of a like a classical training as a musician yeah Randy's me so much for those who listening and don't know\nTo being a someone who writes like great little pop songs for themselves and they know what I mean writes good guitar wrists and can sing yeah and I always ask you about how that uh you know what I mean how how the classical training has affected the you know the the\nThe pop and rock music that you make but what's it like going the other way around after you've liked dwelled in like the ... your own songwriting enough and playing the guitar what's it like when you\nYou know the school year starts again and you go back into playing an ensemble is it is there anything that translates backwards the other way I'm\nThe biggest thing that I feel in this might be disappointed to some people but I I have one hundred percent prefer like the pop music attitude in the pop music lifestyle night it's just it it's the things that brings me the most like emotion\nSo I'm all for the rest of my life or being in my own band for the rest of my life\nI wouldn't be able to answer that question because as much as I Love writing music in you know experimenting with different genres and the way that I saw because I've written some songs that are kind of a little more towards the punk side of the spectrum tight little more towards the jazz side of the spectrum and you know those are the only two options that you have is\nPunk [laughter] but ah [laughter] you kinda right [laughter] like\nThere's just something that gets me about jazz man and wild and uh\nYesterday I spent my lesson with my apply professor learning about shakes on trumpet shakes or the craziest thing it's you know how in like old big band music she'll hear trumpet players going like really quick between two notes okay ah it's basically that and the it's it sounds so cool\nAnd they were the one thing that I could never really like get behind as a jazz player I could never really do because I just\nNever understood it enough and\nNow that I can to like a better extent I spent all\nDay just doing nothing but playing shape so much fun\nIt's nice when you pick up something that like sticks with you and that even like it inspired ... comes right after that it's not always goes for me with learning songs you know what I mean do you do you take joined like learning songs on line I'm learning the covers or do you just do it because you know people like\nI I absolutely don't do coverage because I Know people like great [laughter] I really staunch on that because there's been too many times where I've been playing out in the quad or even in the group and someone will come along it'd be like hey can you play this song and I'm like no dude [laughter] crappy music I'm just getting back to my sad panic of the disco covered [laughter]\nNice and you know what I like about you're ready as you always bring the heat the original heat you know what I mean I go to like I sometimes I'll be listening to like a group of people play in a you know covers a cool but I feel like I like covers after\nI've heard in the original song I'm like oh I see it\nI was I was walking or to my friends or how should the other week and I knew that it was going to be mostly covers and I\nI was going to ask like how I I just walked past as like [laughter] it's like I'm just going to go to sheets and then I got there I was like you know what I should support my friends yeah and I'm sure I went back in I absolutely\nAn hour you a\nA ... ... ... ...\n...
