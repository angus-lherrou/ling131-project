done that many times that's that's like such a weird way when you're trying to like you landed up shake your guitar back and forth you're looking down in LA\nShe meant that you would like to learn and don't know how to learn I mean I Know you mentioned that you're going to be learning a couple of new ones but there wasn't that you've had your eye on and haven't been able to\nHave always wanted a slide guitar oh ... inch long the way they\nDo you mean like one of those ones that like lay down on your last one of those ones on that would be so cool yeah it'd be a good a folk\nYeah these Irish

got him we got the intervals now\nAnd only now are we learning what a major in minor court is and I play guitar for a while so I kind of like got a short [laughter] yeah that world but now with like\nIt's it's beautiful 'cause now I'm getting like a serious actual yeah foundation might be nice to nice for fresh yeah you did did you have a did you have a high school and middle school music teacher that you are lighter\nUm there was more social school that I have that was like for a choir and stuff and she really like believed in everybody felt like somebody and actually when I graduated I made sure that I told her like a good it's great though\nEspecially because you remember them were like I feel like in high school there's a bigger group at least the high school I went to was like a pretty good size so she might have not paid attention as much as other people would have to do but like I feel like middle school also the classes are smaller see the get also you're more impressionable\nI feel like that so definitely true [noise] yeah I feel like middle school have more of an ...\nGuess what something that you listen to middle school that you don't listen to any more than\nAnything it's tough question I think think about this and I think\nWhat ... what do you what are you left behind is right now that you're like oh I'm Glad I left in the past 'cause I I'll start off I'll start off for me I Would say\n[noise]\nAre are [laughter] I definitely don't offend some people tonight oh let's be careful with that oh I'm just not like I'm going to say like Nathan Jana

Beatles and I still love almost every single out in that they've ever put out revolver rubber solar albums that I've ever heard in my life\nBut like I kind of left behind like I kind of like when I got to high school I I had an older friend who showed me like hey the music has been coming out since\nThen [laughter] and\nI'm like oh yeah oh really and and uh that's yeah that's something that I needed because I got an\nA you just do my answer bread really honestly was a huge because like I was upset\nYeah I used to the black keys fanatic two and a lot of middle school I ... and I mean I that's not as much as the Beatles 'cause that's like he's lucky though\nWe're like for me there was one of the first band after the Beatles where I started to realize like yeah modern music\nAlso that would've been a better question what was the band after the Beatles [laughter] that's a good question too I I definitely have an answer for that MGM the night shift or either Iraq or usually like ... what got me\nInto the modern music scene and then I pretty much I don't know not that I ditched the Beatles but I realize like there are greener pastures well I don't want to say greener but there are other pastured explore yeah and so that was a typical\nNot that I don't want to do now it's just like pre she more I don't actually like listen to it as much else they're definitely remember listening like Eminem and like seventh\nGrade for yeah I Do remember that from shady Opie yeah years\nI think right which ... those are like the ... years because I definitely listen to them and when I was like I don't know an anxious boy [laughter]\nI mean things have changed a little project about women in media focusing on lyrics focused on women\nIn music yeah and it's like I'm not even going to go to Eminem do they just like I could do a whole project yeah I mean sure yeah it's got some he's got some dirty business [laughter] finally made it all the way around is there anything that you can think of that you left behind\nWell my music taste has been pretty consistent since first grade oh gee I Know that's super rare but um my brother\nBrought home all the music that I Love 'em but in middle school I I'm not sure if you're familiar with his band but there's this band called prime is wrong and they are it was okay that was the album fizzle fry it is so bizarre fear just weird people and I used to listen to that like\nJust that album in middle school and I also used to listen to see her off at like every day in my life I've got um I still love them but I don't listen to them every day
