[noise]\nOperas now the one coming up that opens this Friday is\nYom and all of the guard what's that about [noise]\nWell it takes place in the rain of King Henry the eighth or and it takes place entirely in the tower of London a which was kind of its own city back then it was a huge structure a lot of people lived there\nUh and uh it was also a very famous prison for political prisoners\nAre so if you had done something against the crown or ... against the king you would get sent there\nSo our our story unfolds on the eve of the execution of colonel Fairfax oh no yeah yeah so the tensions are pretty high when we start the opera and uh there are a lot of people in the opera who are not very happy that he's going to be executed because they think he's a very brave\nMan brave soldier so they hatch this plot to set him free and um [noise] as they say hilarity ensues [laughter]\nI ... we can you tell us a whether he an so a lot being executed or not now my mom would eventually be great if you have to go and to see it how large is because\nWe have I Believe thirty people wow yeah one of the\nCool things too is a when you see the Pittsburgh from oil yards or people of all ages of probably your youngest cast members imagining are in their early ... actually\nIn their teens in there too I think yeah I think Stephanie is sixteen maybe and a Allen is in his eighties wow so it really spans\nSay what a single ... single a repertory or you know a a group that's been presenting\nWorks the same composers of for anyone years\nThat's right we um they're really only to a body of work that have seen that kind of a\nMeat production in repertory company in the in the English speaking world and that is Shakespeare\nWhy do you think Colbert and follow that have been ordered the way they have\nI think because the themes are so humid and I think that is specially ah can be seen in this opera\nThe the characters are yeah sure they they're funny sometimes but in a very human way so they're they're really required to be both comedic and dramatic at the same time and I think that's what makes me stories so compelling\nThere's also a kind of a tongue in cheek minister everything to word a it's almost as if the composer lyricist are winking at you as as you a lift ticket at the ... always enjoyed a with covert followed that had a\n... it's ... you were mentioning singing fast or yeah or the musical challenges of got to be incredible no your director of direct doesn't want to find that uh so what steps and like from your perspective did you choose to cast and yeah well yeah I've\nIn since the beginning on a process talking about what the ... what's going to look like a we held auditions or during the summer or like well the late spring and picked our cats so uh since then I've been a\nMaking the pictures on the stage making us all a look good and interesting to the\n[noise] just just to set to move into our theater so ah October twelve to the opening date this coming Thursday and then chose the twelfth thirteenth fourteenth for yet that's frightening actually out friday affect you you have this coming friday the twelve\nAnd then you'll turn around and do the same dates the following week and we'll add one we've ... oh you do is Thursday that's where I was getting that suffers\nFrom you know and if you come on the twelfth opening night we actually have a nice reception free reception after the show and all the cast in the orchestra and the crew I'll go up and the audience and eat and drink and have a good time\nItself fund you'll get to meet to the Castro I'm sure will feel a great\nDeal of energy after ... opening night at a although I'm sure that happens every single night to you mentioned the orchestra when that ah that's something not to be excluded from our conversation here there's a live Oregon stress\nBut for for ... uh as part of this production and some days it's kinda rare especially to hop on this big\nThat is true I mean there's there's about a thirty piece orchestra which was the size of the orchestra in Britain Sullivan era\nAnd it is rare I mean most people have made me you know a couple of keyboards and maybe even some extra instruments for show but to have a whole orchestra is pretty cool\nBut it should be a great night opening of of this coming Thursday at ... or\n... ... it's are there any songs are coming up that\nThe people will know from this do you think\nProbably are a couple of 'em especially the pattern things but the it's the kind of a opera where you walk away\nI I I think I think that I have a song to sing yeah that's the one I have is a\nPretty well known\nPeople maybe I'm sure you've heard it they have no idea it's from this how I have\nSong to sing uptown familiar just\nYeah it does because it's um [noise]\nUh Sullivan and Gilbert rode it so that it sounded like an English folks are\nSo you take tea haven't I heard this before and it's really something they created for for this show\nSomebody should do a should have actors play Gilbert and Sullivan like writing together and put them up on stage to cut to do it would not be interesting to see their process how they how they work to go\nYeah I've done a little bit of that actually in years past yeah and uh I was involved with a group in New York that did a show called very truly yours Gilbert and Sullivan by gate and rent the same fella who read the book on their working process\nUh and that was a lot of fun to do with all ah found dialogue from their letters and reviews of their shows from various critics\nUm so it really does did give\nA window into their working relationship up that\nWas just looking quickly to see if ah we don't have covert Sullivan in our library per se a ed ... get our music library but if you need to see it and you'll have a chance to see and the taken these songs of the\nUh operas but Andrew Carnegie free library in Music Hall which is a beautiful place on ... or in Carnegie and a great time to easy to get to the park and to take it\nAnd would you recommend this for people if any age to families can enjoy ... what's the run time roughly\nUh for a show taken place I Can't believe you're somebody who's\nEighty one it'd be so yeah I think I'm not sure exactly but I Know he's in his eighties and he's um [noise] yeah he's been amazing support to our uh Wyoming\nThat's a

they've been able to join us on the radio\nOr to preview some of these shows what else is planned for your season this year after the opening this coming friday\nWhen we're doing in the spring in March the gone to ... years which [noise]\nI mean he didn't mention that Sally but um that's a really it's based in Italy a it's a very fun show it's got a lot of really interesting uh\nWell Italian in Spanish music meant and a lot of uh dancing [laughter] I'm not a lot and ah it's that that's a very fun show is well\nWell we're going to take a a little break them we're going to come back and
