fascination and\nOften of some irritation to some parts of the population which feels that it didn't get the education and does a or should be able to get an education for their children and this is ...\nOf the wisdom the witch and the show brain power in the universities one of the questions that arise us about the great teaching institutions is at what point does the student puts himself or herself\nInto under too much pressure when would they be happier at the national university\nTo help us with some of these questions but also to talk about a range of things including the latest developments in futures artificial intelligence block chain and cyber security I'm so glad to be in the office of Dr John Savage\nAt Brown University in Rhode Island John\nWelcome to the broad across new and being at the university for fifty one years that's colonel too young for that to have been possible\nUh and you had a clear before that I Do and you are interesting because you did not come from a family when residency or nothing like that and you went through MIT I did which is a sort of you know a particular clay Justin itself\nAnd how did you come at one point to be head of computer science at Brown when you have a degree in electrical engineering explain I didn't know that you knew that the world do tell me things from time to time well I yes I\nWas very fortunate to be accepted by MIT I grew up in Massachusetts twelve miles north of Cambridge\nAnd uh was not very well prepared for that experience but I managed to receive an absolutely outstanding education at both at the undergraduate level and the graduate level\nOr at the graduate level I did a PHD thesis in which I studied a method of decoding era correct in code\nBut ... and are correcting code is a\nA is a um a consistent data that use it provides plus a check this data that's computers from the data supplied by the users so that it's possible to correct for a limited number of areas that might occur in transmission\nA it's a very important topic you need that when you're communicating over a wireless over a land lines and other media\nWhich are noisy inherently noisy so you need to correct the errors but what astonished me was that the decoding machines were enormously bigger than the encoding machines\nIn fact a machine that I studied the method I studied for decoding was implemented in a machine that was nine feet long six feet high and three feet deep\nAnd over in the corner was a little box and that was the encode her\nAnd the disparity between the encode her in the decoder just astonished me when I left MIT and went to bell telephone laboratories and they were used in different methodology for encoding adding redundancy to messages and decoding them but there was still this big disparity\nSo I became fascinated with the question of why is it that the voters are so complex and I looked for a theory that might help me to understand that question uh that led me into the uh what was called theoretical computer science at the time\nAnd then when I left bell laboratories after two and a half years to come to brown because we want to raise a family and the wind I pursue that topic and what I find myself doing is obtaining results in computer science at new field that was emerging\nWhen I went on my first sabbatical which is a leave that I talk with my family after six years of teaching at Brown which we spent the levels while I was there my colleague Anthony Islam\nOr who was a trained as a computer scientists or he at the time he was in the division of applied mathematics and I was in the division of engineering he wrote to me and he said that he and a colleague Peter Wagner\nFor a and I he thought should get together and to develop some kind of a activity in computer science when I got back we did that and that was a Nineteen Seventy three\nAnd Nineteen excuse me Nineteen Seventy four by Nineteen Seventy five we had a program in place that allowed us to\nAh we have marvelous news things that are going to ... help us tremendously like block chain\nWhich is single verify danger or ... or ... the bases of various strong sanctions in a way that cannot be\nInterrupted later or\nA destroyed and of course there is the hanging over all of this this sophisticated wild throw in small cities which depend on all of these things\nHanging over this is the security of the systems cyber security one of the all areas of expertise if we build a small city always putting ourselves in a huge danger of one day being captured knocked out the same effect says ... without a war will have no phone will have no electricity\nIndia's contemplation a house thing is a threat\nThere is a threat uh and it's because if we automate if we integrate all of our systems are with computers and the not conscious of the security problems that arise as the consequences are going to have cascading failures as we saw was the most\nThat's right cleverly staged very nicely done thank you sir\n[laughter] uh but\nWe have had\nA we've been exposed to new technologies are for centuries\nAnd every time a new technologies introduce their dislocation there I went to subpoena consequences [noise] and we just generally have to expect that will always be the case in our economy situation we have rushed to computerized so many things\nAre without knowing the hazards that we were creating\nThat we do have to address these problems and urgently\nAh [noise] the but I'm convinced that any new software that we're right today\nIs more much more reliable much more secure and software that was written\nDecades ago unfortunately a lot of that software which is called legacy code legacy software is a buggy it's never been rewritten and there is a lot of it used in critical systems by that I mean water supply systems like the electrical grid\nAh dams a lot of these new I O T devices that are being use are being sold\nUsing inexpensive software that's old and never been updated properly and his insecure so to me there is the way to address the problem is to determine\nWhat's the legacy of software is in use in critical systems and replace it rewrite it just necessary\nThat meat will mean a ... or that we will have a very a large effort will be required\nA the good news that's the bad news good news is that it can be a a long term employment contract for a lot of\nPeople can be trained ... there's been a news the news reports recently or people who were working in the in West Virginia coal mining country\nWho have been introduced to coating given twenty four weeks of instruction and moved from a ten dollar an hour job to have fifty thousand dollars a year position\nSo it's possible with coal miners have to be disciplined when they go down to the earth that's a dangerous environment\nAnd you can see that they're going to be many opportunities for people who are discipline to contribute to activities of this crime\nAnd do have confidence in

I. U. P. F. M. along with me is ... and Brad O'Hara and we're doing some different things that they're talking about a bunch of different sports I gotta feeling about it\nOh I'm feeling spectacular Jay I'm feeling great feeling great yeah they're good vibes here in the office this morning or this afternoon rather but\nI have a lot to get to starting with the M. O. B. post season you know wild card games wrapped up then the last week we talk here only ... well we have sports ... was a Monday Wednesday friday four to five however this is my\nPerfect opinions about it so guys what do you guys watch the games would you guys think about the first the wild card games\nThe the ... pretty exciting I Would very much agree the Rockies cubs game when ...\nWas it the longest was the longest a postseason game ever whatever\nYeah yeah definitely I think I think that uh the Rockies definitely deserves that the way they were playing I think they kind of got some bad breaks throughout the game but I didn't really matter in the end now did it [laughter]\nAs I think the brewers right now just or the hottest team in baseball mhm I I think they easily make the world series in my mind just because the way that yellow just plain and he's playing out of his mind I think he is currently the best player in baseball right now\nAnd uh they they start with the first game against the ... theories but then then lights out from there and the pitching stepped up a completely and the ... was was incredible uh aircrafts played amazing and the third game and I mean I feel like they there's no stopping the brewers moving forward in this postseason\nRight or like what you said about the birds Brad if there is a bruise that came out this postseason they're really hungry they want that World Series win this year a Christian yeah which is definitely made a his name this year in the NBA or indeed the race for sure um but yeah I really like bruises doing\nYeah I mean we're talking about it before the Rockies were or the Darkhorse team that we felt we are going to go pretty far here about two months ago we were discussing it and we thought Colorado was maybe that seemed to be coming in here but Milwaukee shore dead shut us up\nI mean it's in all sports all postseason usually the hockey team the hottest team coming in here usually makes it the furthest however we can shoot over there to the New York Yankees over the Oakland Athletics I Know Oakland was that your team ... ethics football and the one that\nWas me that was me and they they definitely made me eat my words [laughter] um but I mean the Yankees playing well to the Yankees are hot right now and and they're definitely even given like the red Sox are run for their money and stuff like that serious type one one but I think the Yankees\nA wreck for cello in in the first game right like so relieved and that's not something that you should have to do a lot of your best to start or if not your best starter and and put them in the game late I think I think the Yankees are actually going to pull that one off um just because I think the red Sox bullpen and they're pitching late and games is going to cost them\nYeah and how bad the David Price look in a in his first start the series on my goodness he lasted not even two innings\nHe was bad and it's just it's a waste of money there 'cause that's a lot of money\nI mean I think though that this is a series that will be needed you know to the biggest organizations in baseball\nFacing off against each other and historic rivalry you know I'm obese ratings are pretty down\nDown and out recently because for obvious reasons and uh and I think that's good I think it's good for the league I think I think\nThat I mean I'm not a huge M. O. B. guy but I Know what's happening in there because it's the biggest players in baseball faced off against each other so that's exciting than we can shoot over to the Houston Astros grown up on the Cleveland Indians there on a two hour seriously\nAnd they're currently down to one right now in the game to sell a member of entry to see how this goes I mean they're pitching has definitely been stepping up for them I Can't recall pitched a great game yesterday and got twelve strike outs in the way and and and that's historic for him or\nSo and I'm happy to see a former pirates player or make it to the postseason and actually doing well so I mean that's exciting for him um but I think the Astros or don't really stand a chance in my opinion as far as the like the world series\nOr contenders go just because they feel like whoever makes it out of the red Sox Yankees\nIs going to be better equipped to continue on I ... I don't think are really getting much of a challenge right now in the Cleveland Indians I never thought they were really big name as far as contenders scale they they weren't plane as well as they could have in the regular season and so I think the postseason is just getting much the same for them um so I'm looking for the red Sox Yankees wanted to make out\nRed and I'm gonna I'm gonna actually disagree with you on that I think oh you are coming into the postseason I I was all for the red Sox I thought the red Sox are going to destroy everyone in the past and I thought they were going to take the world\nThere is just based off their reliable pitching rotation ... uh I really like what they're pitching staff brings to the table and I think their teams really deep I I also think that the red Skelton Red Sox Yankees of the teams as well I really think they can make a ... a late postseason run to I'm not saying that\nThe Astros had this like in the bag but if I'm concerned I think the answer is that the best chance of winning the world series at this point\nAnd definitely the the experience helps the veteran experience helped him and they did it last year and that it that's it says so much you know 'cause players and never been there before he can get nervous I mean sports is what makes a beautiful was that\nThat ... anything can happen any time you know you can make quite a drop the ball and the biggest game this light crowd can have an impact and if these players here they've they've been through it before and recently within the last year so I think they\nWere even seen like some of the same kinds of players their step up for the last year I which they didn't really do much in the in the regular season but now we're seeing them come alive in the postseason George Springer Alex pregnant looks like he could be the the new guy\nOr for for the Astros and then you still have like some of the bigger pieces always pitching well always playing well and so I mean there there are definitely still up there\nAnd the losers in the final last year the Los Angeles Dodgers are up to to want to get their land a Braves and the series right now you guys still have you on the Dodgers are using that can make it back or not you think\nThis this is a rough one for me because if you would have asked me after the first two games I Would have been all in for the Dodgers because they didn't want to run for the Braves uh they were scoring well\nBut uh after six five lost to the Braves who I I think are a highly overrated team I think the Braves are very overrated um it's it's ... it's making me question it\nUm and obviously we've we've all seen the Dodgers struggles in the postseason haven't really been able to make it anywhere um and they are they definitely haven't been able to win a World Series which is the main goal um but I just don't think that\nEither of these teams are going to make it to the world series I don't think they're gonna make it out of the al ... or the house yeah I agree with that and uh\nThey've they've showed this year that they really just cannot execute get W this year\nAnd that's when you need you sneak last performance big time players make big time place if you can't make the big or sent on your couch watching someone else that\nExactly I don't know if it's like they don't have the chemistry or what it is it just I don't like what the Dodgers are bringing the tables off\nIn like especially like you said in the regular season they were not getting W they they barely ... and and now yes but they almost run the wildcard or and then they was it came down to the last two games before before they finally clenched\nSo protections going in after all this I mean a little bit early but you know there's a lot of baseball to be played between now and next week show so you guys have any like heart takes any predictions coming out of this or his production\nI really like what Brad said about the bruise earlier so yeah I liked him coming out of the national league of American League I said it already like that I was just I'm gonna say the ashes they could all\nSo I'm gonna I'm gonna step up here and go brewers are sweeping the Dodgers any and all the as I like it and but it's going to be the exact opposite and the ... I'm saying that the Yankees and the Astros get seven but that the Yankees are making it I think yeah so Yankees against the brewers huh yeah I think that's I think that's the world series\nI'm gonna I'm gonna take her in November the Yankees just 'cause I'd absolutely despise in New York\nAnd [laughter] All right All right so that was all be here on sports talk a lot today and we'll should ever sports which we don't cover much but it was a big weekend for\nA U.S see in a brat here's our UFC specialist I Know I only watched the McGregor in Habib fight among going to try to pronounce number gr Madoff there yeah that was perfect yeah I don't want to come over here it's probably listen if I'm pronouncing wrong or imprison me a\nIt really is good I mean I'm sure I mean they don't white has to deal with maybe someone suing him but I mean like McGregor says all the time the companies worth billions of dollars and even more when McGregor is of involved more even more money so\nImmigration has not pressing charges either yeah I think it's a cool moved by yeah he's\nJust because he's got he's got along yeah he and he got on you can have some yeah they've all got out of the bus incident to you hate to get outside I mean like Louie came to be ... it'd be deserve that yeah like a get out of jail free card the only thing I found is graceful about the entire altercation was uh the guy on the fence\nBe locked up in a rush to the will of course he's not there won't they won't let him back in America I don't think\nThat that's what my than what we're saying he's saying that potentially these guys visas are going to be paid and they will not be allowed back in the country did a lot of games commission just not about these guys come back and causing mayhem again\nOn a lot of the thing there was a people are saying that can be people close to ... were saying that he was going to retire if you want them yet\nAnother question is does he still plan on retiring or because if you do plan on ... and then you're retiring with everybody remembering let live to fight and dinner riot yeah right like you know causing it ride states that we had actually and like you still are can technically the title holder\nBut could you imagine that you're left to fight you don't even get to hold the belt up because they don't want to give it to you 'cause you just fought with everyone outside of the ...\nIf I'm going to be but I I don't have time for this because after reading not only beating McGregor but after this entire this entire message just happen to you just made a brand for himself he did he's he's a ... I'm not a household name but in the sports world he ... he's he's relevant\nNowadays relevant I mean we've seen how like getting hated is how you make fights happen right wing Coby Covington I Do not believe is a good fighter I Do not believe that he should be put where he is but he won the interim title about one tier on whether he was out because he was hated so much that he got recognition shouldn't put into the title fight\nAnd I think that's exactly what we need to start seeing for can beat because it can be was undefeated going into this fight yet he still didn't have a big time fight entail this one\nRather than respect he was he's twenty six now known respected because that's literally the ... level fighters he beat yeah\nAnd now obviously means business when he beats the golden boy so\nI'm excited to see what did you ask you if she goes for this hopefully they do is I'm hoping for is to get the belt if they've vacated off of a puppy that'd be awesome but we'll switch over to the national hockey league\n... you know [laughter] well our Pittsburgh Penguins one on one eleven goes against the first two games\nLater warping when they raise the ... the Boston Bruins had been him seven nothing then again back to back days are all journal and not come over to Pittsburgh and losing overtime\nI guess the same memories I'll look into well not my marriage I look at heart but when does the when it matters that Marie is good when it matters and right now the first two games it does not matter and it really doesn't like in his work on everything they have the best coach in my opinion best coach in the NHL Mike solving so I'm not\nToo worried about it I'm sure you guys aren't either and I think we've got some of the best backup goalie yeah we'd bed bath backup young girl yeah\nI in in ... in the Smith yeah and I I don't think that's something we have to worry about because we've seen rotations last year where they both would come in and still play phenomenally at times and so I Would them both getting more experience and and growing up in the league of I'm intrigued to see just how much playing time they get this season yeah and\nMike solving loves the farm system he loves working with them and you see obviously game success from how good the farms just amazing how good because he was a coach down there and he ran that he ran that show for a while so he knows was talking about a more more than everyone else does I think\nWhat's up with what's going on around the league honestly I mean yes or early ... just the scores four plus schools each team yeah I don't know we were right in ... I'm never seen anything like it before\nRight and that's what's good we talked about this the other day that asked me a sitting there it's good for the show obviously nacho wants more goals because no one ... I mean people that I Love the sport hockey love one nothing games to one games\nBut realistically when I turned ... exactly what's happening when I turn on the Toronto maple leaves game which I Love the ... ... up there and my favorite team and I turned on I just see awesome math is drawn to there's much more just\nTearing it up just hide like go after ... after top shelf one only offering moves lose yeah I mean it's crazy what was what we want to see is what everyone wants to see not even I'm like in ... in the ranking from\nSome of these people in these athletes can do the things we're doing\nI I agree and I I think what what it is that all these all these guys ... awesome math economist David Crosby they bought all these ... and the gold the goalkeeper is they just can't keep up all yeah all these these new players when all these fancy new moves and stuff and I think that's why we're seeing a surplus of golden season\nYeah and it's ... and I think now a ... maybe I mean it's a little bit early I think in some teams the\nThe rosters are heavy a little bit loaded with talent talent wise but others I don't think it's too drastic I think the league is pretty even everywhere out a from everywhere at least a top sex the tops except leaving everything that we have some players that can pull out these moves and put up a great number of scoring but\nAh obviously other teams when you have like ... percent of the pain was there in the third line when if he was on most of more than half and the other team he'd be top six player and he's not on the ... because that's a loaded they are so I think that ah that I chose to go to in a good place now especially with like we're saying I'm obese go down a little bit\nMore boring I think they chose really starting to come up I think the capitals getting not win last year was was big I think of African finally superstar they were talking about that all summer ESPN was all about it because I mean you saw a veteran partying he was swimming in fountains he was living in I was so I think that's good for the brand I\nThink that Joe is in a good place to just I think they're taking advantage of the NFL becoming so it's often yeah ... ... yeah an alternate like physical sports like starting to wear what a better place in Hong drop your gloves and find anyone at any time you know what I mean I I think that any jobs needs to take advantage of the and the NFL's lack of a lack of as a ... and\nGreat point I didn't even think about that we're watching it the other day and for the capitals are blown out the Boston Bruins in large Zeller scored a goal or Zella bottom up its fourth line center trip around in my in my words I mean you have to get one could run to the playoffs last year the Stanley Cup finals the Vegas Golden knights and he scored a goal and he'd taunted\nSeven nothing more Zeller gets back on the rink Brad Martian jumps on the ice skates up to him drops his gloves Pete's still living heck out of large Zeller so bad that he's bleeding down his face and he just they get off the rank because he wanted the bench\nLike if you're on a bench in a sport and then you can just come back out and get the crap out of you and then you're only in the box for five minutes right\nI mean the classic rock by Eller anyway yeah it'd be town on the bench when they're down to them and not ... he's already taken the L yeah anyway like what do you what are you doing like a robot that we're going to go in itself is kind of just taunting\nMatch and and yeah so I think it's like you said the physicality of that I think it adds a whole new a whole new level to the NHL they're trying to go away from fighting in general but things like that I mean you see about one good fight a week like on Twitter scrolling down and that's about it and that's all I think you need\nYeah and I think that's all you really need right we're talking about what they are publicity out yeah and we're saying all this stuff about that you've seen how fun that is and then when the skating on ice was knives on their feet it's pretty it's pretty entertaining when they started\nBeating the heck out of each other\nYeah I think ... is good for them to come up here we have about three more minutes we're about to go to a break for a little bit try to open up a phone calls to the public people listening about on the next been getting a lot of questions about\nPeople trying to call in and ask some questions so I mean fifth week here as a host I'm trying to get new to the system and the technology here\nAnd so we're trying to open up the number is seven to for three five seven nine for eight seven to call and if you do call in and I don't know how to answer the phone properly I Apologize [laughter] I really do we'll get we'll get you on a next week but\nUh we do our best here I Know everyone listening I Know we've got a ton of fans out there everyone's trying to uh sit say their opinion but the fact of the matter is it's not as good as ours and that's just the bottom line [laughter] ... [laughter]\nThey don't try to ruin my career and say something stupid knocked me trying to get in trouble for police I beg\nSomething stupid like the karma day was the best part of that you don't say something stupid like that 'cause I was just going to go I'm just getting\nAll right well woke you up here we're coming back to talk about an F. L. football after a week five it's been one crazy year for the NFL I think the best the NFL's been in years ... brought I object to see you back here and a few minutes\n\nBefore this is Ninety point one W. I. U. P. F. M. Indiana's alternative source\n[noise]\nDuring the Nineteen fifties you couldn't hear rhythm and blues ... box in the front [noise] did you hear all that down and dirty black who's the rock and roll you had to go to the ... [noise]\nFor a hundred plus receiving yours in each of his first five games which is crazy thing about because they want on drafted play division two football in college\nSo I said that's a pretty cool story there around the league do Seahawks gave the rams surprising close game where you got to take away from that I I mean a wins a win\nRight so I think honestly I think the rams or I wouldn't be too worried about a division of like I like I said lots of Ghost Wars and ravens divisional matchup ... a ... year divisional ... going to give you a tough time they're ... they ... if she twice a year and they're gonna they know your game plan to know your schemes they're going to give you a tough game every time\nA the only thing I'd be worried about it as a rams fan right now is to pick up and bring it goes out and cautions um\nI mean typically they don't keep you all for too long to them now for about a week or two if at the most ... uh but really I I I think the rams are still dominant a dominant team uh I mean it doesn't even matter of brain and cooks in ... Cooper cup or out of the season I think ... if you keep the drop in ... and I think that\nYou could put anyone out there and it'll be so awesome it\nAt that at that point it's almost it's at that point just like a a chemistry thing between golfing cop right as you know their roommates and all that things and that's why that's why I think they have such good chemistry it's not really like if you put Cooper cup on a different team well I mean\nRight with Jared golf and not just solely because especially with Sean ... game playing the game plan I Know yeah that often it's man you\nKnow I'm not I'm not worried about the random in the slightest as you also I think the game was played in Seattle which is one of the hardest places to play with yeah but the the how loud that stadium gets and so\nUm I think the only shock that I had was that Iran's defense um ... did not play up to par or ... if he gets the Seahawks off as something that we haven't seen come alive in weeks\nOn end of the rams defense there's always one of the top notch ones and Donald uh I'm In my opinion best defensive player right now in the NFL ... other than maybe are clear Mac yeah um but that that was the biggest shock for me\nWas that was a ... and that's back to back wasted the rams defense given up thirty plus point so yeah yeah we'll look for that going forward yeah definitely look for that I mean\nAre\nYou like you said not too worried about especially next week the rams are playing the Broncos and the Broncos just lit up as absurd amount of rushing yards against the New York jets go absolutely blown out as a a crow had two hundred and Nineteen rushing yards himself\nOnly on fifteenth Dodgers do yeah and got me twenty eighth fantasy\n[laughter] that's all that matters really comes down to [laughter]\nFrom those bench them but [laughter] I didn't\nYeah so if you're if you have tall girl you're going to be ... you're going to be excited about sex which match that gets the Bronx\nI Would not no matter how how good miles as I Would not want to wind up against formula and Bradley jobs well yeah ... yeah but I'm I'm sure\nShopping they will expose on like does everyone else right except in the playoffs last year I was just on Saturday\nIn tonight we have a big game tonight Monday Night football Mr Monday Night Drew Brees looking to break the N. F. L. record for most passing yours in the history of the game\nHe will do it and he will do when I I agree you see every uh what\nMr Monday Night Drew Brees he likes to come out big games the saints need this when sort of the Redskins so it's gonna be things could be a great when a great game a Redskins did ask these dark horse team\nReal big on the Redskins I think I Do think the ... the other night even against Mr Monday Night Drew Brees himself a just cause I think their defense the lead and I think the the oven after nice breast on the by week I think bill nice game plan for the new rules they defend a long time the game plan again so I think that they'll get it done and I uh but for the saints\nUh yes it like you said it's a big game will take a for for ... and therefore it will take him to a big first place leading a division so I really I really think is the beginning for both names\nI have to disagree um I think that things are the better team overall um it's it I agree with you a Redskins defense is is miles above I think the saints defense but I think it's just the power of the offenses as you completely definitely Drew Brees is out of this world quarterback to him\nAnd in my opinion a mediocre Alex Smith yeah and and Alex that has not played to the same capacity that we saw him play with the chiefs in past years\nAnd I just don't think that they have the running game I I Know Adrian Peterson has started to look good in a couple of games that I just don't think he is the same is nowhere near the same age ray Peterson that we've seen liking or even I think towards the end of last year with the cardinals yeah and so I think that the defense for the saints well overshadow the often when it comes to overall scoring\nRight and I ... I think the ... the ... the Redskins often come in the lobby like oh for sure 'cause we know we know the same softens is gonna they'll show they'll they will show up and there's a marketing comes back to the right and we know that the safety fences and showed up once all season jets were surprising yeah the Redskins if they're often can get it done and I think believe New Orleans with I mean\nI Do I say if Alex twelve I mean the whole team runs throughout Smith in my opinion actually very serviceable quarterback and I think that's the if the states want to really solidify themselves as civil contenders and possibly heavy favorites uh in the NFC I think that their defenses\nAnd that fell last year and a now you'd think they have one more year Spanish think there'd be a little bit better but they've not been the stuff that's been carrying it so heavily so so much between Michael Thomas Drew Brees in over ... over ...\nHe's a freak of nature I Can't even describe him like let's say how to go to a girl is I think all the combat brings a whole new level of the running back position that we've never seen I think he's just a more agile version of like a ... right I I it was a minor thing she does\nAnd a lot of people are getting hype about marketing room coming back and I a change of pace of Africa Mehra but honestly I'm not to hype about yeah anger coming back just because of the age in a\n... I mean how how do you even ... out of single ... single with how he's been playing the season like honestly I think this is I feel from last year when we do about the lesser of two headed monster this year I think marriage is going to take over the ...\nI mean he's going to it's it's they're sitting in a good position to New Orleans saints is especially to do this is still we'll running back\nThey will it will be so nice like we said maybe on bell for the Steelers for instance gets rap after rap after when he was he's not sitting in Miami round jet skis and drinking champagne if a man with strippers yeah I'm\nDoing his thing and a\nSet of safe have it's so good to take all that pressure off all come era off this third downs getting banged up through the middle ... through the line ... jumping over if you give it to get the anger imminent gums obviously perfectly fine contend that's his job\nI mean as we thought just ways best out it'd be a third down back like that I think that's so good for the saints in the long run because Drew Brees aren't going to be for long much longer\nAnd ... to ... a\nGenerational talent that the team has right now the team's looking forward to go ahead and I think if you if you can get the wraps lowered now you'll be better in three years however\nYou won't have Drew Brees and through years she might as well when now\nAnd one thing that I Will look for is I I Do like the ice\nIn the backfield and so then you kinda have that question of who's getting the ball and I feel like that that really can throw off of defense is author of the defense as a couple of times last year when they would do it and so having that kind of like in your in your back pocket um is definitely something that the audience can utilize more than a couple of times the season\nAnd that's really winding back to talking about pickers Graham can know bang then\nHuge sixty three your game winning boat second long longest game winning the tied tied the longest game winning feel going NFL history so set the record for the longest however the longest game winning feel goals zero seconds left out and see a comment I was watching that game because I came to know I like to see the panther succeed\nAnd uh to see him bank to bank that field goal to complete the bomb to at Newtown call of duty racist is twenty four kill streak\nI really like this ... yesterday I mean I thought that was very very impressive and I only have two words describing ... fool [laughter]\nMax he likes to say it was for the brand or that was absolutely awesome it was thrown to the uh I really wanted to see the John good ones because I feel I feel like there's lots of chaos going on in New York right now you know ends up with her do speaking out against the his team right now after he just signed a huge contract with them\nA yeah lots of chaos but hey if granted I went to step up and be a hero\nHe put the cable on them you know give give give that Cape off take that off the camera and put it on in a while to say about it but you saw the giants in turmoil after that game where they were literally the head coach enter do going at each other and the post a and press conferences after\nOr do obviously complaining because he is saying that the team is not a team they are not coming together they don't have the passion they don't have the drive they don't have the energy that adult back and looked for he wants the ball and he wants to make the play so you might as well and let them make the point\nYou could see that lack of cohesion on the field and then as they are not coming together\nIt's not connecting with routes and and that's something that you got to watch for it because\nUh his offensive line has been kind of letting up living out of their life events on line right right through and so when you're rushing plays and that's also going to be a struggle so I I think the defense didn't play miserably which I\nMaybe I'm putting I'm putting that very very casual [laughter] because they didn't play well but they didn't play awful and so that that's when you kind of look at the office and the offenses really letting them down the entire game\nThat's all and on top of that that's where I had four interceptions because if you're continuously yeah I think that we had the defense will start to adjust they'll start to see where you're going\nAnd and I think that that's their biggest issue right now is if they don't if they don't rely on their running game that all of the ... the defenses can account for them and I think that's what we see in the past weeks and I just really haven't picked up on it because I never really saw there often says the issue yeah\nAnd I think that's something that they're gonna have to change very very quickly or else you know they're not going to be able to continue on on this past and and possibly lose the playoff up to ...\nI think morals absolutely terrible [laughter] yeah you could say oh eight to four hundred yards the yeah you'll sit through for pics in half of the aphids yours came garbage time and the fourth quarter uh I really don't think he's really I don't think he's the answer for this uh this jaguars often said all\nI think that really what we learn from those games with the jaguars events gonna have to carry them if they want to go anywhere in the playoffs\nAnd we're running out of time here you'll get democracy now later but priorities you know what it is you know when it does and you know how to sew will take away big thing the eagles look bad\nI'm just going to come out and said I don't think that he was a very good I mean it's not even a super hangover you sold the Atlanta Falcons do this they had the year of years when they made the super bowl when they choke to the super bowl they should have one that they were they were literally carbon copy of the eagles were last year what\nThe Atlanta Falcons were the most explosive off with the great very good serviceable defense\nWith MVP when that Ryan Carson went sort of one of the last year you come back home was the same exact personnel you lose a coordinator you lose I don't want one player on the defensive side of the ball ocean Jeffrey look bad ... scares\nThe office of one looks a mediocre I don't think the eagles or eat\nSickly in order to have any kind of hope for the playoffs because they have not been looking good I I'm a huge and he has confirmed and\nI I Will confirm that the eagles like absolutely atrocious like ISIS raw so yeah I don't know if it's a super will hang around and if it's a cartoon and wants his legs yeah I don't know what it is they look terrible there'll be an absolute mess or they definitely don't want a playoff team as your by any means ah yeah just a mess and maybe some crappy calls with the Michael Bennet are up in the past yeah screw it I'm over here\nOr whatever yeah whatever I Want to leave the game come to ... yeah exactly yeah\nYou're a professional athlete if you're really complained about one penalty I mean unless it's Jesse James dropping the ball I Can't well not even Big Bend to pick right after that it's his fault for that\nThing is when Josh how important are thirty plus points on a defense and then of course of ones can't even get your hardly gets Twenty one gets a little late garbage that is true pointed out to the game Twenty one points I mean yeah really I don't I really don't like with the eagles were you able to do so\nWell and the five votes to will and the show with a natural always hot take from the rest of the crew any

huge accident because you Jackson I think it's a terrible 'cause she oh I think is one of the worst coaches I think he's going to be gone soon and I think that's another ... gonna turn and I think

traveling the country with your new book rage becomes the power of women's anger I don't know if it could've been timed any better\nBut talk about the response around the country and what has happened at that time\nI think it's clear that women on the left are galvanized by what's happening um men as well but the\nMomentum is really coming from women as we've seen over and over again during the protests um on the on the right actually they're they're a similar anger on I Would say it's the anger resentment it's really looking backwards\nUm as opposed to to looking forward to it is it's a different sensibility but clearly women who were maybe complacent before who were willing to\nUh let things slide a little bit are no longer doing that I think there there are fed up I think they're scared I think they're worried and they're interested in holding people accountable in a way that maybe it wasn't true even several years ago\nI Want to turn to Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader speaking Saturday about the impact of Kavanaugh's confirmation on the upcoming midterm elections\nThe ... been employed both Judiciary Committee or Democratic senators and by the virtual mob took his shoulders all of us in the course of this process\nHas turned are shown far deliver the only thing we had not been able to do which was to get our folks are little fuel to shed at all to ship all year\nHe talked about the mob muddy Benjamin describe what you saw outside\nWell it's not just what I saw outside Amy it's what's been happening in the last several weeks a particularly inside the offices of the the senator has its\nMurkowski's office of people who came from Alaska that people who came from Maine powering their hearts out I've never seen so much emotion that tears the love\nOf for the people who've been telling their stories sometimes for the first times uh in in uh in their lives opening up like this are so to call us a mob is such a a a level of disrespect\nUm there is a new movement in this country that the me too movement has gone further and deeper and now giving\nVoice to uh people who are just feel\nThat they need to be heard and the fact that they demanded that there's senators listen to them whether it was in the elevators and the hallways\nIn the halls uh or that kind of a speak outs that were happening in ...\nOutdoors as well um this is unprecedented and I hope uh that it is deep enough that it is forming a a strong cohesive a movement among people that will resonate through this country and change the culture of our country the way that young people are brought up the way that parents teach their\nChildren to respect and a and a respect for women and men of so hopefully this will have a real cultural shift\nMisses me to founder ... speaking on NBC's Meet the press Sunday\nWe have set a precedent in this country of not believing of speaking at women in particular are lying when they come forward with these allegations when people come forward is allegations sold that sent the macho believe survivor is about can we start with the premise that people do not often lie about the pain and the trauma of sexual violence\nIf we start with the premise that me believe that is true then you can have an investigation you can have an interrogation of the facts and that kind of thing this is not to say believe people blanket and don't investigate and don't do any um anything else besides believe though\n... ...\nThe actress and picked up\nOn that day that um the Harvey Weinstein article was first written a thousand attacking shown many women and went to sleep\nUm and the response to her saying if something happened to you I'm please respond with me too and she was just inundated\nYes I mean I think that it's very clear that while people are talking about the presumption of innocence\nThey're not talking about the presumption of innocence for survivors and people who have been assaulted and you know you can't you can't say that Dr Christine Blasey Ford um ... was confused or lying unless you presume that she is guilty of of\nA lie or not knowing what she's talking about and\nThe whole um sham of the investigation and the course of this confirmation I think attest to the real fear with me too which is not as the president said that women will lie and destroyed the lives of men but that women are telling the truth\nAnd if women are telling the truth and it's not just an indictment of a few bad apples but an indictment of the entire system an indictment of the treatment of survivors and the women by a man with power particularly on the on the right\nAnd so this idea that people are lying which is absurd on the face of it because no one has anything to gay and ultimately by coming forward with these stories I mean look at the outcome of this Dr Ford is hiding because of violent threats and Brett Kavanaugh is about to become a Supreme Court justice so\nYou know I mean never again should anybody here that this is ruining a man's life that boys are in danger and in this case obviously it's young white boys um because that's really\nWomen to express and I was wondering if you can talk about that and also Senator McConnell characterization of the mob [laughter]\nWell you know I think that\nUm it's useful for McConnell to to talk about a mob these are citizens they're articulating their needs and there are defending their rights they happened mainly to be women which means that they're associated with unhinged emotion\n'em and you can see that in multiple forms of commentary coming from his party but\nI think that we all understand certainly as women that anger and the expression of anger comes with the penalties for women were socialized to put others first to restrain our expressions of negative emotions because it causes discomfort\nEven his little girls are rewarded for being nice and pleasing a not for being assertive or aggressive neither of which implies that were angry by the way it's just that the assertiveness and aggression and anger are are not separated and the behavior and responses to girls and women\nAre so I think that what we're seeing now in this explosion of women's feeling is is clearly a pent up need to be listened to and believed that the demand that this stopped at the gas lighting stop\nThat the doubting stop and that the disregard for
