correct well that's good five you you don't have those Boston went to the semi ... absolutely got ah\nWhat's happening for the smaller cities mean to you know they're just um yeah that's a great thing but the great questions so\nThat the cities are changing in many ways actually so to me as a technologist I think there is an injection\nTo the management of the buildings to the way the transportation\nWorks in a city all of those things are changing so as a technology is these are phenomenal times for people like me who understand technology and understand the application of technology so I think the injection of technologies like I owe the wrong\nAngel nice old thing Internet of\nThings a block chain artificial intelligence and machine learning I wondered evolution I is the way it was actually live\nCan we break this down a little bit yes ah let's start with machine learning what does that mean what\nMachine learning means is that um we have been able to program computers forever but\nUsually even be program a computer the computer ... action and does something for example you go to an ATM to withdraw money and it does that\nWe've been living like that for the last let's say fifty sixty years in the computer revolution\nBut the change that would be at about to see is that the machines I'm going to become a little bit more smarter which means that they're able to decide on some critical decisions on their own can you believe it so that injection of smarts is\nI Believe that there's I'm not sure I Want to know it [laughter]\n[laughter] that's true but that injection of smarts that is the basis for artificial intelligence and that's what machine learning is all about machines learn based upon it activity or to task\nSome body of work and they can adapt and they can actually make it better the next thing\nAbout the Frankenstein worries people worry that machines are going to get together and talk to each other and to get a say let's overthrow the human race [laughter] ah we call it all now\nI taught a and I don't think it's going to become a reality at least for the next hundred years\nUm because we as humans have an ability to control how much intelligence we can embed in these machines so if we have a good regulatory environment and we have the um\nUh ability to program the machines in the right way then I think we can create a system that would vote for us as humans I mean don't have to be hostage to the whole family\nNow like I said we don't monitor system like electricity or just may not have a ... system it has done so much ... human yes\nUm and we're not frightened of it anymore we were at one time we worried about it you know I wasn't around but people didn't worry about yeah I'm OK well back to the small city we've got machine learning which is part of artificial intelligence is what is this mystery block Shane [noise]\nYes that's a great question actually so Roxanne is this new technology it's distributed computing technology it's an evolution of some existing technology so this is not something that was thrown in our lab\nAnd we have to fear that this is an evolution of existing technologies into distributed computing but the reason it's evolution its revolutionary\nIs because it has a way to quantify trust in the machine so for example but we have the ability to create smart contracts which is a business logic but it's not just developing smart contract but this machine can also execute and do the governance of the smart contract which means that the interpretation\nOf the any contract is not up to the human we can actually\nMoving on some lady I I'm just as the Internet has more than the talents was exactly the same thing that one is it and then you're absolutely like monsoon bleak way\nAbsolutely from it technology perspective yes it is distributed ledger of database scattered yes there is a smart contract that works on a distributor ledger yes the data is immutable these are characteristics of the technology immutable\nMommy say they're dangerous and miserable that means you handle last minute one subcontractors entered into a block ages therefore old line\nYeah they muted ability is on the phone\nThey show is the last safe you know mistaken center there is also that ruled on\nThat is totally true actually and I think or whether and what you're mentioning is that uh like I said uh that uh immutable today is the Achilles heel but it's also one of the biggest benefits\nAnd that usually happens um when does it ever lose new technology and utility means the data the records cannot be changed so once you create a transaction you know you bought fewer visits from me that is qualified in the machine it\nCan are we going to see this used in that election [noise]\nAbsolutely yes I think the obligation of blocks in in the election and government is a fantastic used caves to prevent fraud and to prevent even hacking and we will have absolute counting to there'll be absolute counting they'll be\nSo that when the polls slows the result will be known deposed cannot be some tests and\nIt cannot be contested as long as we can go to the right smart contract and the data is also secure which means even if somebody hacks that it is ... because you can only have one computer and have been blocked in the data scattered across multiple ... so even the hacking is not\nChain fits into this small city yeah so in order to understand the obligation of blocks in in a smart city let's spend just a minute or so to know what smart city is and what is happening behind the scene [noise]\nThe way a smart cities becomes is smart city is to the collection of data to for example the intimate thing devices or by having a smarter transportation system\nOr by having you know smarter traffic lights so all of those systems collect data\nSo if you think about it when you collect data it's somebody's data it's your and my data so when we go on a ... do less\nYou know a hobby as somebody is it according that we actually passed it certain milestones and they're charging you two dollars or whatever for the toll that data is being collected data is being collected about you as being collected by about me you know twenty four hours a day\nSo think about it in a smart city the data is being collected over and over and over again\nNow we would naturally fear as human as people that the data and be compromised and you and I have seen data being compromised on a number of Web sites\nWith smart city we have to preclude anyone hacking that data think about like that right ... can be successful only if you have the confidence of people right\nHow do you get the confidence of people Roxanne is the technology that allows you to give give that confidence to people\nAnd the way does it is that the data that is collected\nCan be protected in a manner that it cannot be hacked and therefore we have safety and security\nIt's going to have blocked chain is a very hard and we're bored of it\nBut the telephone companies on talking I'm pushing five gee yes a five day which is the next generation I'm ... now the G just means generations and benefits generation\nAh waiters or fifth generation fit into the small city and why the telephone companies the big ones right GMT for rising et cetera so ... to have a piece of this action\nI think I think are the ones that you mentioned um are the are are the ones who really want to control um the ecosystem and in fact I'm In in Sacramento um that is a deployment of ... and now getting into five jeez I'm by one of the large I'm a telecom companies you mentioned\n... and the reason for that is because we're going to live in a connected city um and the communication infrastructure provides that foundation so everybody wants a piece of the action because of that\n[noise] and where does the individual attention this is the individual disappearing becoming a grain of sand [laughter] way be shoved aside and which is the small city I mean ... individuals are important I mean we don't want to be part of the machines decisions we want to be ourselves\nAbsolutely light so in my opinion I'm smart city is basically developed for the benefit of the citizens you don't build a smart city so you can have a smarter infrastructure you build a smart city so you have a smarter infrastructure that brings value to the consumers and the citizens\nBut if you have a private lunch and\nJust something that we all understand and use but don't know how it was so fast can we use block shy and without knowing how it works without knowing about data miners and proof of work equations and some of these things which are quite terrified people\nAbsolutely I think I think you're you're hitting the nail on the head I think I think people believe that they need to know block chicken to use it you don't [noise]\nI ... in fact the blocks and it'll be so transparent you wouldn't even know it's out there today when you walk into an ATM withdrawal hundred dollars things happen behind the scene\n... would work like that you don't need to know how the ... the database management works all you don't have to know how you'll call we're shooting right actually pick up exactly you pick up the phone and you make a cell phone call right at you don't need to know how the technology works so\nThis is exactly how blocks and would work but it's going to make the process more efficient it's going to make everything simpler but as a user you wouldn't even know that is working behind the scene\nI've been writing about technology for a long time\nAnd are the two factors that I see always in Dayton are one they use for which it is intended is not always end up being the end use yeah a different mission yet and and you've almost explain that in snow for or just from crypto currency is yes from and for electric\nDelivery and phones and it was for many many other things right answers supervising old infrastructure we haven't mentioned that yeah that's I'm\nAt but what are the we've seen one on the anticipated the constant wind switches over and left the ride sharing the Scrooge is a doozy other unintended consequences of small cities I think I think\nSee many of those um obviously you and I could not predict over Twenty years ago um if we had we would have done and waking right exactly and in fact ah I was reading this morning that you wouldn't even have predicted the stock price for Amazon for example Twenty years ago [noise]\nUm so there are certain things that we believe\nCan benefit ... people like you and I but then there are other applications that we don't even know about so the so that's how I see it I think the technology will provision new applications we don't know what they are some are known we know what the next five years looks like but we don't know what's beyond\nWho's going to pay for all this I go to an email this morning before we came on the SAT which suggested that there were going to be huge costs associated with locked trade and you tell a genius and who was going to pay\n[noise] I think eventually um [noise] it's it's it's you and I who eventually end up paying you know from our pockets we pay our taxes are those taxes I don't know dissolved in creation of smarter sip is\nAnd I think in the public private sector for example is going to be a partnership of the public and private sector and implementing some of these solutions so if you look into globally in Europe or you look into um you know even even hair I'm In the U.S uh Sacramento had one of the first public private partnerships\nTo fly the smart city\nSo there are many partnerships like that which are coming from the corporate sector and from the citizens\nWho is the part and shove in Sacramento with\nUm I don't know exactly but it's the Sacramento is you know the the the government there the local ... go and rent and also some companies corporate companies telecom companies\nIs it ready to be a battle between electric utilities telephone utilities water utilities\nWe'll be connected in the smart city and all of them will be some how dependent on each other or bring value to each other I don't think they are going to compete with each other so in my opinion I think it's a symbiotic relationship to benefit from each other\nBut they're not going to compete with each other there are some overlaps of course but I think those are those little sort of settled down as the market is evolve\nA finely privacy or or some of my friends in Britain say privacy ... take your choice we know what it is we don't want other people nine more we're doing absolutely don't want people to know what we ate dinner\nIs always assume did you want privacy because you may be up to seven hanky panky but that's ... ... is a basic human regard to have some privacy or\nWith the ah the the the smart grid which is telling every time we done some appliance on yeah very detailed knowledge of what we're doing with electric stop sudden they were going to have walking down the street just kind of been recorded on this is a very disturbing future [noise]\nThis is a world in which you know NO NAME may not have a large say\nBut you are highly recorded which always suggest the possibility\nThat evil governments can manipulate that to their own\nBenefit a privacy denied is somebody else given an advantage\nAbsolutely I think technology is a double edged sword [noise] um you can benefit from it tremendously and it can also be\nAbused in the wrong way I'm so hot so this is ...\nDinner at the proper regulatory framework so that we have some controls and checks and balances I'm In the use of this data and technology\nSo we had better tell a political moss just to get on the subject because they don't seem to be concentrating on it these days\nI think is the one of the most important things that the regular doors or have to look into the data privacy because the data privacy is not just data it's about privacy about you and I it's about us people you don't want anybody to know what you eat for dinner or for what what are you going for ...\nIn fact that is the foundation of building confidence with the citizens if you can give them the confidence that the ... they will block dissipate so number one the\n... off a energy blocked drain consortium your a fascinating man\nAnd you've told us something about the future which is coming at us thank you so much for coming on the program my pleasure thank you for how does our protocols for today thank you for coming along Joe's [noise]\nCollege radio jerk Ninety point why now than\nDemocratic social and learn on the ballot in states like Florida Kansas and

French I'm Amy Sisk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent sixty minutes interview President Trump said he'd look into a scorching un climate change report\nBut if I don't know that it's manmade\nHe made these rather contradictory comments as the environmental protection agency is actively scaling back Obama era regulations that would have cut back on America's carbon pollution from coal fired power plants and vehicle emissions\nEric Lipton an investigative reporter for the New York times is all over this beat he's covering the environmental protection agency including bringing to light the ties between polluting industries and top agency officials the Allegheny friends Reid Frazier talked with leaped in for the latest episode of our Trump on earth pod cast\nSo there are over Seventy environmental regulations this administration has begun are tempted to ... begin rolling back [noise] can you talk about what you've seen and why you think the Trump Administration has been so aggressive in this area\nI think that when Trump was elected it was clear from the start that one of the primary things that they wanted to do\nIn addition to filling vacant seats in the federal judiciary was to eliminate as many of the Obama era regulations across the spectrum of government\nAnd the EPA and department of interior are two of the agencies where they had moved perhaps the most aggressively and expeditiously to try to undo the Obama legacy\nAnd I think in part that's because Obama was so aggressive himself in terms of using executive powers to expand the federal government's reach at the ... century or so there's a lot of targets that Trump was able to go after\nSo I wanted to talk about a couple of these ... one of them is ... this is an insecticide that the Trump Administration tried to keep on the market can you explain what clip here folks isn't and what happened with the rule on prepare for us\n... and fruits and places around the United states\nAnd there had been research that

O. B. network for reasons sometimes and that's the watch baseball so if you want to listen to baseball I guess now it's not really the time to do that because\nWe don't want to talk about it and I'm just going to be straight up within so we're just going to fly rate and to the M. O. B. which tipped off last week a but a game we discussed that between the Seventy Sixers and\nThe Boston Celtics but that's not to talk the talk of the town right now is the fight that happened between the Houston Rockets in the Los Angeles Lakers on prime time Saturday Night neck I Know you were watching what were your thoughts on what's happening\nAs it was happening I was in disbelief that Iran does out here thrown fisticuffs it with a with a crisp all I could not yeah everyone mine never my years that I think the rousing round though in Christ ball thrown hands with an MBA court so yeah I was in absolute shock\nUm I think uh looking back on it I think Ron does kinda little dirty for but I ... I mean they're both veterans league they know what's right and what's wrong so and let them let them only have about it\nGoing crazy there was a fight happening in the NBA but I think that now it came out that Ronda did spit on them that's that's pretty that's pretty ludicrous I mean the he spit on him and he threw the first pond so I mean Rhonda that's obviously\nWhy he got suspended longer than Chris Paul did but then we have to talk about bringing them running in ... started the shell shocked he shoved James Harden the start the whole thing and uh then he came running back in ... punched the first guy saw and it was because of all people first got punched Chris\nPaul you think he's a short us I mean you know what I'm saying you wouldn't think he'd be the first guy ... face but go on for that yeah I don't know I I don't know why no one retaliated back to I'd like to go out yeah\nThat was I don't know I I I wanted to do I really did like it I mean it's like we talk about all the time and and uh NHL fights are better I think fights make it and it makes you feel like the players aren't ... as well\nRight so it makes it makes it shows you that their knowledge is like oh buddy buddy like yeah actually here to they want to when you get yeah they're exactly or so\nAnd like no matter how no matter who's hanging out after the NBA uh uh all star game no matter who's hanging on the off season and police the players are friends of course pollen LeBron James or friends in the Bronx was holding back Chris Ball though they weren't even on the same team but you like to see people\nGet go at it I mean they're not friends you know especially when the court is war it is four and a\nPain in the western conference man you had in common to be edgy this year yeah and I I I mean good better be competitive than on like we've been seeing you might always produce and other I'll flip through\n... you mentioned that are probably the first time\nThat the NBA's been this competitive and this wide open a not so predictable you said this time it's unbelievable unpredictable most unpredictable season the last four years so that's obviously great I mean we obviously want to watch and we don't want to see that we always do you want to see LeBron James tear it up but what do you think he's been doing so far you think you can still praise them\nI'm ... I think the bronze look fine diversity games you can look even been even ridiculous but I mean he's a he's looked fine ... uh not good enough to win but no but they're too too tough western conference games against the rockets into Israel is a yeah I I won't take much against the wrong that um\nThe I think I think it doesn't show is going to be going forward\nYeah especially especially because of the team so young team so that on chemistry I mean is the first two games that are fighting it looks like they're getting\nBlown out either yeah they're losing type games the southwestern\nEspecially especially the rockets that was it was closer to point it was close to a point but like all basketball games are [noise]\nYou have that one shot that that goes into a complete different stories are they ... they worked intending their LeBron played while I thought he played well I mean James Harden obviously that whole that whole team all around us your favorite maybe they could do without always your favorite while they were your favorite last year to take it like at the Houston Houston\nRockets yeah I liked him coming out of the was last year for sure yeah healthy correspond game seven I think they yeah last year ...\nThey blew it by they blew that bad yeah James Harden play terribly yeah that was that was painful to watch to be honest and uh\n... back ... try I've been seeing a lot of quotes vows saying it it it's disgusting how he gave up on San Antonio and now that he comes here is actually trying as hard outright taken taken the reins of the NBA trying to be paid shown at the NBA who's really the best leagues so\nWhere do you do respect them for what he did last year I what he's doing right now\nJust I'd disrespected ... for what he did last year a in San Antonio I think he was definitely healthy you're just sitting out because he didn't want to risk any injury or for next year you wanted to keep it is it's kind of like blaming them below the NBA I'd say just wanted to he he wants to keep his word a while he's injured um\nBut this year I I I've obviously been tearing up like he said he uh so I I Do respect that he's actually trying to like the ...\nTen times to choke when it comes down to it for the penguins except once they've ever to states ever that everyone loves and guess they all think memory doesn't want to back to ... oh well ah as for ... as for Vancouver\nThe city's retired so daggers older veteran leadership on that team brought a Brock the rocks fire and that he had a game where it gets the penguins so I mean the young talents are bad but I don't think they have the what what it takes to sustain coverage but a playoff team the last few years\nJoining a drove certainly get pieces on that theme more than ... come to come around so I'm going to say Anaheim Calgary and San jose says is that that town that seems just undeniable\n... and ... and ... I mean\nAnd even with with race like that or\nThe other store but you do you think that the that the competition still ... to spread out do you think the Atlanta like we said every ... all teams in the central\nOr potential Stanley Cup winters and then the metro has the undeniable the defending three times in a cup champions as well\nDo you think like ... I mean Tampa Bay is competitive every year they make a deep every year but we always say oh we made the ... well say Tampa Bay Tampa Bay made the finals are good that they're it's your chance to win they make they make the conference finals over here because the only a division suck so that's where they play in the playoffs you know\nI'm looking at lag condition right now it's wrong to Tampa and probably\nThe Boston Boston for sure what I'm doing a lot\nBetter though since last year ... um if I guess so yeah this is kind of um you know you have the bottom yet Ottawa Florida in Detroit although I was surprised that the world is going to make\nThe issue and I say that can last yeah I still think they can be kind of look still early yeah like six seven eight\nNine games played um enjoy you know having your games and now I Would say um I mean\nYeah I mean right now the rod in my ...\nBut I think it's going to ... it's going to be I don't I Can't say who's going to number one yeah three I Will tell you this or that Iran is going to be in that top three well Tampa though we did have it just had a great game in Chicago six three when last game um and I say I ... up there\nAll yeah Boston's gonna be oh yeah they I mean they have the veterans and do what it takes to I'm going to harass when it comes down to what he can play well they've posh or not might be one of the Soviets players in the league born on hands down let's say ... it might be the ... he might he might take that 'cause his goals like especially the playoffs last year when he's\nYeah yeah he did now is it like I'll walk or right now I'd ... I'd be down do you think that macho or maybe even buffalo sneaking a la carte over it's surprising team because\nI you know I don't mean buffalo fan but I you know won't personally yeah I think that uh they're Pfizer and get more like writing they need to be\nYeah I mean it's about time it took forever I think they could possibly do that now do\nThey won't get a tough spot obviously that but it might sneak into the playoffs and she\nKnew how to see I think that the mattress to the metro teams or to start teams like New Jersey yeah well ... yeah\nIt's like yeah I mean they're all even right now it's kind of like an older and they always are the\nFire as a family that we are big wages against Jersey a five to ... asking um although it's kind of kind of you say the flyers go it it kind of frustrated because they had a lot of talent they have taken for Jack\nAnd they have drew in and they have a training for players I'm\n... the fruit\nOf words that can turn 'em and then say that is definitely improve or people with autism is wasn't are starting to get like France I guess I don't think it's true because you know back then even the king and he did really well for them but I think it even do better for the flyers\nNow I think you might be that overall best player on the flowers thing or the\n... got a couple of really nice and good lines I think that also um early in the season yet so his views on um\nA lot of fires I was going up and down from ... to ... three that's coach I used to always been for a while yeah we need to find actually\nAt one time we had a good time when I'm going to ensure that yeah that was crazy and a half of the slide it\nYeah it's the coaching Katrina hello yeah definitely one of ... percent that definitely has the catchall somebody for like\nTwo or five ... ...\nI I think is right\nNow ... fire right right now and um yeah ... ...\n... you know ... ...\nYeah yeah\nYeah I don't know I just don't I think they have actual job brownie\nOne guy's ... brown the heart is drowning what ... yeah [laughter] ... [laughter] well uh yeah we'll we'll finish talking about the in the last ... minutes you're talking about Pittsburgh in Philadelphia but I Want to talk about something that is interesting\nI thought last year I personally said Nathan McKinnon was going to win\nAnd BP and I thought he deserved to win and be and then obviously Taylor whole ended up winning little ward and if you look at the reactions their prices because they can there was an absolute shock that he did it when MVP of last season and now she has come back for vengeance\nThis year leading a team in Colorado like you said\nWho were absolutely tearing it up a big surprise and I think it all stems from Nathan McCain and do you guys think that may what he should have won MVP last year now he has fourteen points [noise] lane esteem doing better than anyone thought it was eight goals six assess a plus seven\nI mean ... came back he had a few here to ... but I mean that's the only reason this point we're total so I think we can really cares that team\nI think of Adam ... last year and a lot of players and like I I think every year and\nA hard why ... I I don't think the issue right now\n[noise] [noise] [noise] well\nI Know yeah yeah I'm I'm\nA ... that same as hot cheese I Do know immature always I don't I don't like karma David respect respect how fast is and how quick is with the stick but I guess if you don't have the pieces around and if you can't lead a team from nothing to something then what kind of cats and really argue I think you can be as fast as he wants talented as you want\nBut it really comes down to ... I think cats as a team even have a good amount of say in what is the team she'll be like I think what for instance Sidney Crosby has talks with management\nAnd Mike Sullivan and they ask Crosby about word of the team should go what players will be trailer players should be kept I think they value is opinion so do you agree with that now the grants or some general and abroad as it makes a into it yeah and the cat and dog if\nYou're in the ... you have to be a leader on the team yeah are you are with the rest of the team looks at first yeah in in a if you're if you want to build a good thing comes through with the team it all sorts of the gap and\nYeah I agree and I think that look at all the great cabins and we've seen in the past Derek Jeter how many World Series that even with the New York Yankees the LeBron James captain ... ... is the greatest he made about yeah and that's where you see success\nYeah that's where he's exactly you see from Sidney Crosby seem to go to Tom Brady right to see from palm received from Big Bend even here maybe that's a catcher in the ... and I think that a quarterback the needs of do a better job being a cat and he ... he was young but you've seen everyone get the captain see you on that all the elite captains now where young when they got it\nOffers you do yeah yeah I might not be the biggest stars and ... ... ... ...\nThere's missing the bread is mentioned the brand that I mean that is if you think about it like this we like we said call drew\nHad over a hundred police last year that's remarkable year over a hundred points and modern day NHL and no one even ... we're we're not talking about him being it'd be pretty right they made the playoffs we're not talking about stuff like that it's because I I think it's because when it comes when the games come down to it\nCame on in the southern cup playoffs last year you lose seven nothing I mean yeah you blow might a few games the teams played almost the whole more whole half a season more like\n... yeah ... yeah\n... ... ... or I mean yeah it is kind of like\nAnd the NFC and they might have come out that I see now with that win against Dallas on my controversial call\nVery controversial way call there on the field go with a false start that no one's ever seen before and uh Dallas got moved back end missed a field goal by about a yard so what are your thoughts and controversial calls about and basically just referees bought can decide and games and the NFL\nFor I don't like the referees involved in this year's a fourth games or they've really been making your breaking games with things right from the past their goals whether it's a like this all sides goal or false start wherever the heck it was\nWherever it was a you know the rest I don't like the involving with them I think uh they have too much of a role in the game now ... when the uh as opposed to the past [noise]\nUh as opposed to the uh I'm Sorry in regards to the Redskins and the cowboys are I think\nUh the cowboys could have easily won that game and that going to happen um the cowboys I think they're looking mighty fine right now especially with the addition and mark Cooper um the Redskins uh if they keep performing against good teams like they have in these last couple of weeks I don't see why they can't win the division so this divisions really up in the air uh Nancy's\nYeah I think it might be the pores division so uh\nBut the Jacksonville Jaguars the Houston Texans oh okay yeah yeah yeah\nA good point there one All right and Justin Tucker missed missed his first extra point of all time\nAgainst Drew Brees and the New Orleans saints tribute has five hundred touchdown and the New Orleans and he beat Baltimore for the first time was the best off as he gets the best defense best all fence prevail but if I Want the overtime or did you have winning\nA really good I'm In anyone's game a it was a even gain the entire uh entire evening\nI Would probably one with the saints honestly just goes on that's minor you injure speaking so uh I was definitely rooting for the ...\nI'm Justin Tucker while what a time the Mr versus your point yeah honestly awful I Would feel terrible man like each probably so often every single time he goes in the field of getting an extra point and then he goes out and does that niche probably shattered everything isn't everything he's ever all those were out in force\nI mean ... years and they kicked the extra point they now really sick and they go out and say talking but I mean you know it's ... points in the old ah yeah right with the words in a way to\nThe time to miss an extra point when it went over time in a\nIn an absolute no disrespect to Drew Brees I think it was more of Justin Tucker's last and it was ...\nWhen it really wasn't that yeah I was going to ask that I I think so too I really do I think I think Drew Brees as does a\nI think he's got he's amazing but I think the same softens performed or I Do I guess we're seeing is the number one defense for me I Can't take anything invent some interest I think it was more just an Tucker's right foot taken now than it was ... right\nBut ... and the New Orleans saints had by far the hardest schedule in the NFL and and I send the stories that\nLast season that go off and the hardest schedule NFL when rod offer the sunset when they were when he retires I think I think that's what's going to happen this year we're going to get them in and they're going to give us Peyton Manning he's going to be fixed in his favor\nJust like it was for ... that is just like it was for Ray Lewis and just like it was for Peyton Manning they're going to see all of the greats go out rod offer the sunset\nAnd the right the common a\nKansas City LA\nComplete dominant teams AFC NFC do you think they have to what it takes all the way things are going to fall off I mean I'm not saying\nLose one or two more games and fall off and not be super contenders because in my opinion from what I've seen I Can't see a team in the FCC's stopping Kansas City I don't think Newark New England can do it especially in arrowhead right is Kansas City comes out number one and I don't see 'em I said rams ... losing more\nLikely than I'd see Kansas City or just those\nI see a well with both teams they definitely look like the both the ... side of the best teams in their respective conferences ...\nUm the rams they looked absolutely unstoppable like who is I don't know who's going to beat them or it might be random who knows hopefully it's not an in an unfortunate atomic the super bowl or in the playoffs like their first game I'd be terrible but uh\nI think they'll both when their respective conferences I don't I don't know I'd just like you said you're going to have its up ...\nI I I personally don't see anyone I don't see anyone stopping if I'd especially Kansas City Kansas they did this last year but that that they didn't do this last year they won last year they didn't patrimony homes when the NFL with twenty two passing touchdowns\nA twenty three hundred yards total in Cory Monteith ... being as late as they are I mean their defenses obviously shaky and we'll see players will see big Ben we'll see\nTeams in the AFC that could maybe even take off Kansas City and I would say that one is the New England patriots just 'cause we've seen them do this you're already\nUm I think new England's very talented team we see them every year in the playoffs they just execute so well in the playoffs and they're going to be trouble uh also the Steelers a of a good fight against gay and see if they're in their first meeting\nSo ah I think the Steelers are just getting started I think they're the engines is starting to get oil\nAnd uh it's going to start running soon uh hopefully\nAnd less I think the the the Los Angeles charters might give them some trouble in the playoffs do who knows a yeah charters are deep enough definitely to beat them in the rubble\nUm division foe to a ... they're going to beat them sometimes you know\nI agree that is that's awesome I take in as for the NFC West the rams have that by far including\nAnd if you ... there's no competition at all no\nI mean Seattle obviously we solved them give the rams a little bit of a competition Seattle's one third of the last four coming off of by going to see how good they really are this we can help for cars I mean a Russell Wilson can't take the Seattle Seahawks I'm ... I'm interested in saying that because Russell Wilson made a push from Miami ... last year and if he can take this team\nAll way from what they are and to squeeze in the playoff spot in fact I could see I could actually see the Seattle Seahawks sliding into ... bought this year that ... deathly deserving Russell Wilson all the way you know absolutely I Need when Miami ... for sure\nAnd I guess we'll do a little bit of the visual debate here we are going to predict teams to which teams are going to come out a top which division said we disagree if we do push our case so I'll take a vote here a little bit of a vote you want to start with the NFC or AFC\nA flip a coin\nNFC we'll start with the as the north Chicago Bears Detroit Lions Green Bay Packers\nI'll uh I\nI say a tough thing to lean their Vikings but if but if I had to say probably\n... at the tough one\nRight ah I think it's definitely the Vikings division to lose a they have a very tough schedule this year in the NFC um they've they've been competitive with every single thing they play they no one's like I'll know was beat them so bad and maybe the eagles that was a rough game for them but uh\nUh and the bills game was a writer for them to I forgot about that but uh it's definitely has to lose\n'em Rogers might slip in the playoffs Detroit could even when there's division anyone could really when this division it's up in the air\nUh but if I'm going to go with who I think is going to win division I'm going to say the Chicago Bears ... just got a they've completed with such good teams there and they're surprised everyone I think their defense is looking kind of unstoppable uh I don't know who's going to be able to score on them besides maybe to go on Brady but ah yeah they're looking real nice\nLooking like Jacksonville last year proudly\nYeah honestly it by the dolphins can perform a while the defense but at the same time I don't see who could beat them ...\nLong as the office can score enough to win the defense insolvent exactly like Jacksonville did Russia I think in my opinion I think\nIt's ... like that right I I Do think however Kirk Cousins will come out of top that I've seen north being that the team as more complete I think the team is set more for a longer season more pro wall success I trust cousins overture pesky ten times out of ten\nI trust I hadn't seen Lynn and we'll tape is Mary started ... on the come up now starting to look good I mean officers last a week or cousins so getting hit the most\nThe ... the most however will tell you this\nAnd let's see east we talked about this a little bit already who's coming on top and why\nI'm going to say the Dallas Cowboys and that's because ah I see that there are the number three defensively right now I'm rookie late in van ... event Leighton Vander ... is an absolute visa for a for ... middle I'm pretty uh pretty good so far\nMore Cooper they just got number one ... that was what they're missing in down here I'm going to lay off ... didn't twenty sixteen I don't see what they can they can be at the top of the disease with the uh Los Angeles rams I think\nAll the way I mean this year I'm pretty dominant home home and I think that um every fire all cylinders on strategy Kelsey geez\nI had the cheese on top of the division I have the chargers going further and further than that in the postseason though I think Los Angeles says in the I think most Angeles charges I think they're a deeper defense is much better I think Phillip reverse Melvin Gordon Kennan Allen\nI think I think they can do it I think I'll fence of le they're also more experienced with Philip Rivers rather than a patch moms maybe not as flashy but their numbers are very similar I Would read them allowed if I had time All right well it's five o'clock now\nSo thanks to everyone for let's say I'm going to go around you guys have any plugs you want to plug before I play ah my plugs [laughter]\nUh let's go don't need you really bad buddy pleas for for ... a hotel faith though Austin the as does anything you want to talk in any last thoughts\nOr presents then yeah All right\nWell this has been at for sports talk live for ... to ...
