Northeast Public radio there's Ira fuss felt the publisher of ... of the daily framing and associate into publication ... New York New Jersey and Judy Patrick formerly editor of the ... in Schenectady and are now with the New York press association gay man ... ...\nSo we have a lot to talk about here by the way before we get started there is a public service announcements from\nA retired school librarian and the public library trustee thank you Pauline who\nBecause we invite our readers to read it and she pointed out that after the debate that she had just seen between the nineteenth congressional district candidates there was a short discussion concerning the difficulty in separating fact from fiction and she hopes to remind our listeners that real research consist of more than a five minute Google Search\nAnd that their school in public libraries can often find a plethora of valid and appropriate sources\nIn fact more schools had full time librarians who are given the time to partner and coordinate with teachers starting in elementary school we could be educating everyone was true research skills in all\nForms of media in these difficult times it is more important than ever to make sure the libraries and librarians or support in our town and school budgets to which I say bravo bravo indeed you know we worry and we talk a lot of the show about people not having the analytical skills that good reading of the media\nThen educated a readership might could give them\nThis is a potential solution here anyway we have to talk today about some of the issues that have come to light at that time of our taping involving the bombs that have been sent around the country because their immediate issues involved in this as we're speaking we don't have a suspect in custody there's a lot of investigation going on but we have had\nAnd being is it's just an attack on the media or is it not that CNN bomb and what do we think about the coverage in general\nWell one of the things that I thought it was so interesting on the CNN thing was\nWe know that Trump himself the president has been um basically agreeing with the trend at all of his rallies which is to CNN I Believe that CNN sucks in the ... that's what they say yeah and they do it by the thousands and so now when CNN gets that you the president is hypocritical might\nStanding up and saying we have to be nicer to each other when he's been leading these chains and talking about the presses the enemy of ... people and setting up the stage and each of the people who got bombed by the way has been called out by this particular president\nNow what's interesting about this is that right afterwards you know got people like me saying see\nLook president leaves this kind of thing you get what you deserve he's the one who set the whole thing up and now he's ... he's trying to mitigate it by saying we have to be nicer to each other\nBut on the other hand Hannity and Limbaugh and all these other guys are going in and say it's the Democrats who did it in order to get sympathy for themselves so you see the divide even extending into the press in which this kind of nonsense get set\nRight that's a technique called fought flag I like it and then went crazy on Twitter yesterday were forced to really speculate at this point because we don't know about whether this was someone who was mentally unstable just acting and who else may receive one or the sisters packages\nBut it is interesting as I noted earlier\nThat it went to John Brennan at CNN who doesn't work for CNN but it it didn't go to Jim Acosta who is a frequent target of the president's attacks so\nDuties alluding to is before we went on the air I was saying I heard an interview with Michael about Boehner your former New York state official who surmise that CNN was not the target but John Brennan was because that's who is the bomb was addressed to\nAnd Brennan doesn't even work for CNN and his name was misspelled on the envelope which may speak to the intelligence level of the so called bomber\nBut let me play devil's advocate I'll stay like the devil or I can do that some people might think I Am after that what I'm going to do but we all will agree I Believe at this table\nThat Trump has raised the temperature in this country to such a fever pitch that it would not surprised any of us if they arrest somebody who says he or she was inspired by Trump\nThe question I have is to what extent since this is the media show\nDoes the media's coverage does the media's commentary which is often overheated the cable news panels quote unquote in where they spend time fighting with each other also raising the temperature to what extent is the media are also responsible for what's going on\nI I'm not one to defend the uh programming of cable news I really don't think that that's appropriate but I Do think that the responsibility rests more heavily on the shoulders of frankly at the White House as Jeff Zucker the president CNN said the\nPresident ... the White House press secretary should understand that their words matter\nThat's where they show no comprehension that that you know we have\nThose kinds of attacks which we have to cover I I don't think that we can just say well we shouldn't be covering what the president says that would be getting this president at past that no other public official as\nWe've learned that he has just integrated the nature of conversation in this country and yet we kind of have to cover it dealt with it because he's the president damn I hate it when I agree with ... but\nStop putting Trump on your radio station what are we supposed to do his the leader of the free world he makes an outer rings and it's ridiculous but we have to cover it don't one yes you\nCould change your programming so that you're I don't know I mean maybe that what those people are saying is they're tired of political programming and they'd rather than on the roundtable you talk about arts and leisure travel\nOr I'm Sorry but I have to defend myself against is what we would get on the sea and that's what rex always that he always says\nThat when they say oh that's what other people say or some people say ... years but it's your personal attack you know it is no I'm saying this person is saying why do we always have to talk about Trump but you do you're talking about Trump all the time we do and be ... it and let me just explain something to you wreck for whatever it's worth\nThat program that we did that and find that to get an it's popular even ... that we did that right [laughter] oh there you go\nTo your life is autos Robin God popular program and\nPeople really listen to it more people are as many people listen to it as listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR nine ... it's amazing it's wonderful and imagine what would happen if you broaden your audience by bringing in the right as well\nYeah and you'd imagine we'll [laughter]\nAnd I don't mind I'm not going to let me go back 'cause I'm I'm not talking about not covering Trump although\nThat's something we have talked about from time to time I'm just wondering whether the ... the rhetoric\nOn some of these cable shows on some of these op ed pieces in the New York times\nAnd in the New York post are adding to this climate I mean I helped to hell we don't have a civil war this country I Believe it's already been stated by many that we're in a cold civil war but you know when you start talking about violence or the whole other new ball game and the kind of rhetoric\nGot up and vote is now something we have and anybody who comes on from now on I was watching Joe Biden the other night and Joe Biden was employing a lot of the tactics in terms of is appealing to that crowd there then you would see\nFrom Donald Trump you know that the practice ratings eventually tanked\nSo [laughter] 'cause I live my\nPoint is that I think journalism is respected at the local level and so I have hope that at some local radio station stuck a TV station smoke reporters working for newspapers their readers do ... what makes you say sure you get some criticism from some of your readers listeners but\nAny kind of you know but you would need time but\nBut there is I think the locals do respect they appreciate what you do I I think\nLittle reporting to us that while I Wish you accurately as confident that I I look I look at the responses on Facebook to stories of my newspaper prints\nAnd it's vile often it's right out of the Trump playbook often it's fake news in caps off and even when it's your local ... well I mean\nI don't want to speak treat for the times you knew the disconnect that and maybe this reflects negatively on my old newspaper but as long as I was at the daily Freeman going back forty five years we heard from the community and nobody would buy the paper if it wasn't for the comics\nThe police ... and the ... and so nobody likes him interrupt fish with yeah it was that we had a radio guy in town who used\nAnd then he had died prematurely what a shame\n[laughter]\nWe wish him do that but I ... I mean I I maybe you've not heard this line before I've I've always grown up with the line that says\nNobody likes their local newspaper I can recall our newspaper going into the market Poughkeepsie Journal was serving and hearing from readers there is a boy we're glad you're here we hate the picket see journal and then we would have\nVice versa this another newspaper either Middletown or Poughkeepsie would come into our market why I'm Glad to see there's another paper in town because we ate so nobody loves their no clear local news\nYeah there's some of that by the way if you wish to write to us media WAMC dot ORG Alan ... Ira festival do is that just speaking Judy Patrick and I'm Robert Smith\nHere's a a listener who asked say professor actually doctors are tackle unlike you will like thanks very insightful show every week he's concerned that the words sausage untruth misleading statements inaccurate statements and so he says why doesn't the media just use the term lie when Eli\nI Do always have and I've been severely criticized we we've been discussing that here long before Trump but it's just a word that the press is just avoided using because there could be some nuance to Wyoming we're all using it more now\nI went on this morning on as we speak on NPR they had an outside reporter coming in and it was talking about the Saudi Arabian misdeeds the great misty and and the reporter I think from an English paper a British they've called it a murder and the NPR host corrected him I said we're saying\nWe don't saying murder we said he might have had his fingers cut off and be a result of this fight yeah unbelievable it could have been an accident you know there is the question of course about the intent to deceive but this professor suggests when the president said\nSince the line it's a perverse little lie\nQuestion beyond the media issue is he has so many demonstrated lives every day of the week multiple times a day\nAnd yet people are still supporting them this is not somebody saying read my lips no new taxes this is somebody saying tomorrow is friday when we know tomorrow was Saturday based on lies set out there\nYou go I reflect spelled Ellen shark ...

today's program of the commonwealth club of California\nI'm Gloria defeat president and CEO of the club a nonpartisan non profit public forum dedicated to airing diverse views unimportant topics of the day if people were surprised when Stacey Abrams one her party's nomination to the government ... earlier this year\nThey might also have been surprised as they learn more about her life an accomplishment Abrams is the first African\nAmerican Woman to get a major part of this is a tornado nomination United States and she says she's running a very different campaign the Democrats have been running for the past couple of decades in addition to her political life she has a history of starting in leading companies and a less well known history of writing romantic\nSuspense novel to learn more about her we invited Stacey Abrams\nTo the commonwealth club to discuss her life and her goal she was in conversation McCauley current vice president of news at Kiki meeting this program as part of our good ... series which has underwritten by the Bernard ocean foundation now let's join Stacey Abrams and Holly ... at the commonwealth\n\nGood evening and welcome to tonight program at the commonwealth club my name's Holly turning on the vice president for news that cake UD public broadcasting and I am delighted to be your moderator for tonight's ...\nBecome the governor of Georgia she is the author of the new book minority leader how to lead from the outside and make real change\nMs Abrams grew up in Gulfport, Mississippi and she writes I Am driven by a bitter hatred of poverty and the lack of mobility that keeps families in endless cycles of wasted ability her book is a roadmap for ambitious people who may not have ever seen themselves reflected in the power structure before\nOr excited to have her here tonight to discuss minority leader her historic run for governor and to take your questions ladies and gentlemen please join me again in welcoming Stacey Abrams to the\n[noise]\nAll right what she talked to us first about the influence of your parents and you write about their values of education and faith in service and you talk about how your mom disliked the terms working poor or working class and she instead use the term genteel poor\nSaying we had little money but we read books and we watched PVS so both of my parents grew up\nIn Hattiesburg, Mississippi which is about an hour north of Gulfport my dad likes to say he grew up on the wrong side of the tracks and my mom grew up on the wrong side of the wrong side of the tracks\nUh my mom's family was that abject poverty you read about in Mississippi my dad's family was slightly better off but not by much they both went to um they both struggled in school my mom was one of seven she's the only one of her seven siblings to finish high school\nShe's the first one and her family and the only one to go to college she went to graduate school became a college librarian moved back to Mississippi and\nYou know there's a history his two older sisters went to college he had a great had an aunt who had gone to college but no men and his family had ever gone\nAh my father was not supposed to be the first because he couldn't read an imagined grandpa young black man in segregated Mississippi in the Nineteen fifties with dyslexia or they just told him he was stupid and he heard it a lot he heard it from people who knew him who knew he had this amazing mind\nBut because he couldn't read because he didn't meet the metrics that we're normally assigned to academic performance they discounted his capacity\nWasn't going to have the ability to be valuable and ... and how I did things but the other reality was I Am an introvert and I tend to I tend not towards large gestures I tend to be quieter and my approach I'm very\nPassion but my passions are\nTempered [laughter] and and so that the reality was I had to think through how do I demonstrate my command of an issue demonstrate my passion for an issue but also combat the fact that people thought that I was aloof because I don't I didn't go out drinking and I wasn't as convinced deal as they thought I should be\nAnd I had to spend a lot of time thinking through that and I sort of decided okay\nWill not change and then here the places where we can negotiate but once I decided that than it made it easier to live that because when the attacks started coming\nI was able to to weather them so when people said that I was called an aloof and like yeah okay that's what you think I mean I'm I'm a perfectly nice person\nBut I'm not going to be the person who glad hands the way you expect me to a but there were some who said that I needed better relationships skills and that was true because I had made my way through without building a lot of the the um personal relationships that you often need to have in politics\nBecause the hard part of making these choices that you're off in\nDeciding for or against someone you consider a friend but if you don't have an emotional connection to personal connection isn't a lot easier to hurt someone it's a lot easier to make hard choices and mean choices\nAnd I was missing out on an opportunity to engage people in my humanity and to engage their humanity to as I put it if not float stop stupid altogether at least slow it down and and so I had to learn how to\nEngage that part of me that I normally would have just discounted and so it wasn't necessary mhm you may have just answer this but um what's the most useful a criticism that you've gotten from a political opponent\nThat I'm used to be nicer [laughter]\nAnd when he said it I completely discount it I'm like I'm very nice shut up um [laughter]\nBut I I sat\nWith it and I thought okay what does he mean them and what what I think they're even in the worst critiques of ourselves there's usually some kernel of truth and the part that you were vial against the most is probably the part that\nYourself you don't we don't know who you are and I am I tend to be fairly\n... I like a fishing is the word but I mean I I've got a lot of stuff to do and we've got a lot of things to get done the world is on fire and I don't have time to talk about you know whatever it is as you want to talk about like this tell me what you need and I'll get it for him in a way I said in the book is look\nI don't ask you how your day was but if your issue as you were sitting in traffic I Will help you with carpal and I will organize a whole system for you but I won't actually remember to say and how was the ... [laughter] [noise]\nAnd so I have to practice and and what he meant was people need to know you care about not just their circumstances but about who they are and I have to think about that because I Do care I just don't sometimes remember to ask\nAnd so part of my responsibility is to think not only about how do I help with the mechanics but how do I help with the\nThe moral and the the internal\nAll right let's talk about this run for governor I'm running for governor [laughter]\n[noise] I\nBelieve you read in the book that on the spreadsheet that you wrote out um after college but paying for college brick breakup had a run for the mayor of Atlanta and you read wrote that to be governor of Georgia so we've talked about this hatred of poverty\nWhat what other things are motivating you why why do you want this job\nThe governor of Georgia came about because I did think I wanted to be mayor of Atlanta in part because mayor of Atlanta in Nineteen Ninety to Ninety three was the highest position an African American in the south had held a Doug Wilder\nSeemed otherworldly what was acceptable what seemed possible was that I could be the mayor which is the highest executive office I could imagine a black woman holding in in America\nBut it was also important because I Lived in a city that was changing at the time it was largely African American but with a growing white population\nBut what I realized working for the mayor was at the mayor's job is extraordinarily important but it is bounded on every side by the decisions of the state but the governor has the opportunity to determine the bounds of capacity\nThe governor can say that these things are true and set a moral tone and the policy tone that allows the mayor to do more\nYou talk about when you started talking to friends actually and and acquaintances I'm about the idea of you running for governor that people call we're saying society isn't ready for a black female governor um and that this was an arrogant idea of you\nTo even contemplate this um and I maybe the maybe the book was born with us [laughter]\nI I started writing it before but it helped\nAnd its harrowing it is emotionally devastating to talk to people who've known you most of your life who said oh you're so smart you are so capable you'd be a\nGreat governor ... like they were giving you a diagnosis like I'm like I hadn't noticed oh my God [noise] that changes everything [noise]\nAnd and it was set in a way that was to what I realized after the\nFist or fifteenth or fiftieth conversation that it was an excuse for why they\nSchools and the few times I may have said some inappropriate things um [noise] but there there that's going to happen for many people when you want more than people expect you to want or than they think you're entitled to want\nThat to that moment where you have to decide how much do you want it because it is a is a terrible moment when those who should be your cheerleaders are the ones out there playing the land mines to destroy your opportunity\nAnd you know one of the most devastating moments for me in this campaign was at ... someone that put me in positions to learn how to do this job not only opposed me but did so in a way that tried to diminish my reputation and my credibility and\nThat it's hard to come back from it's hard to understand what did I Do to make her believes it that was appropriate and did she did she see something in me that I didn't see that makes her suddenly abandon what she has known as me for Twenty years\nAnd it's hard it's it's very hard and you know I don't have a full time therapist so you don't have to figure out myself I'm [laughter] and when I figured was look I scare her and I scared then\nAnd that fear may not be a fear of me it may be a fear of what I represent it may be a fear of what they thought they believed and now they're really not so much and the issue is do you let that fear either your own or there's\nDistract you and deter you and I think the answer is absolutely not a going back to your earlier question you figure out is there anything in their fear that is legitimate that I Need to work on ... but sometimes the answer's no no this is just there's uh\nFor governor is that rather than go to the traditional route which I think was what a lot of people talk to you appeal to the swing voters moderate your message etcetera\nYou're trying to expand the political voice to pull people into politics who haven't traditionally voted who haven't traditionally felt that politicians and

I Know I'm not much of that ad or no hey everyone does your good man and\nThis is the Wednesday show for sports talk live unfortunately Monday show was cancelled if we don't want to talk about that but no I don't think we're allowed to but going off on that the NFL has been a\nCrazy one honestly had like three receivers traded today or the Tuesday for like golden Tate was traded dumb areas Thomas was traded um [noise] there was one more I Can't remember if don't my head\nBut I'm Mark Cooper was traded to Cal was way before the deadline and that's pretty much all news everyone pretty much knows about that time a tie Montgomery\nWas trained as well oh yeah that's right you can consider him a wide receivers kind of a running back wide receiver\nFrom ... threat however I don't see much of the ball handler anymore after he uh yeah some of the game against the rams are and that was pretty much the whole premise behind the trade to the ravens because after that family wanted him out of Green Bay which\nSounds not pick for him that's all they gave up for them as a seventh round pick so yeah I don't know how to feel about that\nYeah I could go either way he could be this might be a better opportunity for maybe but at the same time I seen 'em clinic decks or whatever his\nName Clinton ... yeah that's right into the red Skelton is a solid quarterback or\nI thought it was a safety\nThey safety is either or they have the corner of type ... you can play some anywhere for any ... I was\nNo one expects and especially a move that Clinton decks you know one of the best safety's I guess as you guys that go into the Redskins who are up and coming team trying to rebuild their looking a lot stronger this year and I think that's going to ... that can improve their defense by tenfold\nWell I Know a kind of like a big thing before the trade deadline was some firings for both Cleveland teams NBA NFL with some huge acts and being fired and Tyrone Lou and then often is the coordinator taught Haley being fired which I was a little bit surprised about that one because eight games\nAnd we all thought taught Haley would like kind of fill in the shoes of few Jackson once he was fired but then once we saw him gone um and it was a great willing to get promoted to interim head coach the Cleveland they get a lot of moves\nYeah looking looking forward to the future and seeing what Cleveland can do they got rid of their scapegoat a huge accident\nSo it's going to be interesting to see what they can do not only on all fence but on defense as well their defenses looked a little shaky miles care haven't had the best of seasons you said an average season but look to have to see him have ... season so looking forward to seeing what he could do\nThat so that HBO hard knocks if you're on hard knocks your coach getting fired one already heard like there was some reports saying that taught Haley was already having problems with players and I think some of the coaches\nWell we saw that in Pittsburgh when he when it's time hear him in bend disagreed on a lot of the ... and we all know Baker Mayfield he has such is more of an attitude than Ben Roethlisberger does\nAnd honestly I think it's taught Haley is just a terrible he's a terrible leader altogether um he was selfish yeah he wants things on his way he doesn't like the quarterback really take the reins and we noticed whenever ... able to call his own place\nIt benefited well for the Steelers and then we taught Haley got his foot in the door it kinda crashed and burned forum\nYeah he doesn't have like a team\nIt looked like he was he is acting as though he was the head coach and he was having very um major discrepancies with many of the staff members on the team and I just think right from the start and it's just a miserable marriage\n[laughter] now\nI I didn't think the trade in line ended yesterday but one one trait I thought would happen or maybe it could happen was I was thinking maybe the eagles my trading exposed to the giants or something like that\nI don't see that happening now but that will I yeah I don't think it definitely room for a surprising option but\nI think I think the eagles will keep them around because you remember this was the quarter back and won the Superbowl he didn't start the year off slow but I don't think the eagles would be would be quick to get rid of them um if anything I thought we were in the ... Peterson coming to steal it for a living on bell\nThat was one thing that me and I'm Me Stephen end our friend Jeff art we're looking for we're looking for that but sadly Steelers really took no action in this one well especially Packer Patrick Peterson you know he wants to get out of Arizona may\nFires there high as how I Want to get out of Arizona right now\nA bit of a jumble mass down there but overall I think that I I really thought that Patrick Peterson wasn't got was going to go for at least maybe a second round pick\nI Know Arizona was asking for a first I don't think I Believe yes ah yeah just I think asking a little too much for a experience a little bit to experience guy he's getting up there in age now\nI was just kind of like you know the raiders were trading away a lot of stuff I was just surprised that there card and go somewhere out all this 'cause Jon Gordon or grew in sorry had like he has three first round picks I think it is\nYeah and if I'm if anyone would want to the giants I definitely without their car was one of those well yeah you know your system yeah good system or we saw John ... and as you said\nI think um I think you see something in their car I don't think that he's quick to get rid of him I Know there I Know their car has potential is just it's been rough for him with\nNo almost no running game because Marshall Lynch hasn't been the greatest and like no receivers like Mark Cooper like the highest one of the highest drop past present and while he's gone now he yeah he went to America's Team so yeah but still\nLike ... [laughter] and athletic all Americans deemed the cowboys but [laughter] but like\nI said look at who the raiders have now really no one after ... Cooper they got rid of him they haven't really had a solid defence ever since the got rid of ... Mac you got to be questioning what a ... and his team now\n[laughter] yeah I Would question a lot but [noise] trust the process that is well off like the Seventy sixer fans would say trust the process but now\nI'm with the whole ... Cooper situation in Dallas you guys think he'll do fine or you think this is just going to be the end for that Prescott maybe\nI see that's a tough question because I think ... falling out as an outlet but as you said I Want to keep her as a high is one of the highest drop past percentages in the league um\nAnd we really we didn't see avoid filled in or when a does Bryant left Dallas but with the addition of him already Cooper if a Cooper can stay healthy yeah we've seen a lot of he's very injury prone if he can stay healthy I think he's finally going to be one or the or the press got needed to get back to give a voice back on track\nDallas has not had a quote unquote speed wide receiver in quite some time and I think adding mark Cooper was a big trade I don't know about\nTrading away at first round pick for um the other little steep steep especially since the cowboys are probably going to be looking at a mid first round pick I Would say better trade for the raiders because you've got a lot from argue over\nBut it looks good for the cowboys\nFast player you know like ... and um I think the one on same we walk and yeah I think overall the cowboys are looking fine um I don't know if they're really a strong playoff team but they'll probably sneak in there probably are yeah wild card or something\nBut I was surprised to see dumb areas Thomas being traded to the Texans and all those kind of a weird one I knew there was talk but like well even with that system for so long that really solidified it was well for\nGoing out with the ... season so they needed another wide receiver granted the under Hopkins is solid but you need someone else for the show was in the past because he's showcase that he's got a strong arm [noise]\nUm but yeah with well for drawing down they needed someone to marry as Thomas grand he is getting up there in age he was right there for them to snack so I mean it surprised me but then again it also really didn't because he\nBought him well they went with Golden State though because even though he was traded to the eagles now he was another potential like receiver that someone could grabbed her tried for but I don't know is news you lose I mean yeah ...\nGod fix it varies holiday that's the Texans more in my opinion he started the you're on the contract as well I think if you're looking for a good trade you have to look at how much\nHow many years as ours contract and I think that with\nThe extra year on his contract that looks good for Texans\nThey get to keep them for that you know whatever so I think it was a solid trade in my opinion it works out for both teams that I was looking to rebuild and Houston's in a way all in at this point Yeah Bill are Brian is on its last legs in my opinion\nAnd he has to give the shah watching some extra targets\nAnd I feel like I don't know why they have this feeling like Mary's Thomas gives me the vibe of like Andrew Johnson when he was with the Texans kind of like\n\nI could say levy on bell but we don't have enough time for us to rant about him so that you did you guys talk about um golden take well\nYes briefly but I Know you might want to say something like Austin sorry I mean um\nAnd stuff and um yeah who ... who is the top receiver in\nPhiladelphia right now I went to the main targets ... which is pretty much the top tied in the ... or I mean receiver wise yeah ... and a nasty as a little bit but I'm not as you looked at more no more there over the weeks yeah\nA guy didn't go to the condition do so he's going to play the flock in my opinion with Philadelphia socks for a lot wide receiver some play the ... when he won the super bowl with Seattle\nA couple of years back and I expect him to kind of take the reins as at that position [noise]\nAnything you want to level acre no love rate on what like just the whole yeah or I'm not really I mean almost want some good [laughter] okay [laughter] you look like you're going to say something that's why\nI was actually a zoning at first I was never mentioned the great thing [laughter] yeah\nI Know it's it's terrible but um [noise] uh well Shawn McCoy was a surprise that didn't get traded this week I was surprised a little bit 'cause I Know there's a lot of talk him going to the eagles or other teams\nI there were reports drawing near the deadline that said bills weren't looking in to trade McCoy just because they really don't have any depth behind them or they have Chris Ivory but as we've seen Chris I read very injury prone Chris Ivory is very injury prone because he leads with\nHis head and he's a he's a big power back a tiff Warren ... D to school but I'm just overall I resolved player is just that he's not that current and NFL part you're looking for he's kind of a downhill writer and\nWe'll take the hits and I've just\nReally had damaged his career a liar leg injuries as well that ankle than McCoy can go just go the distance from the ... yeah he isn't very ...\nI I'm not shocked by both not getting rid of him the bills me to look into a running back in the coming draft in my opinion they haven't written to replace ... because the south Korea's not getting any younger so at some point you have to say\nNo that's the one thing killing was trauma causes age that's why he's kind of more injury prone at this point to be honest\nYes are just looking into\nThis draft I expect them to drop the running back I'm not going to say that they're going to drop one within the first ... first two rounds but we've seen alive third fourth round running backs take and I've been very successful\nIn the NFL the last couple of years I expect that's what's going to happen with the bill is\nNow I found it funny even though this is kind of old news Josh corn again in trouble for tardiness before the Monday Night game patriots those game you know I I [laughter]\nIt ain't for other reasons that he's been busted for before I'll I'll I'll be fine with tardiness um they they only started them late it's not like yeah I'm really bad happened and he's still put on a stellar game so\nYou know I mean I Can't say I'm surprised that he was late but it could be a lot worse yeah he can only was\nHe was he a couple of minutes late with in our late\nAre no reports of showing how long you\nKnow I don't think I think it was like forty minutes ... like an hour or something like that and but still you know bill bow jak is really a ornery about things when it comes to coaching\nThose one step away from retiring so\nYou kinda wish on that don't you\nTry to raise their attire than I Do do cheat but they're both going to leave and have him so\nI highly doubt that cars are those to having like falling out almost ... ... I don't\nThere's no such thing as falling out between those two in my opinion\nI remember a lot of those running backs Rudy Rudy Johnson was one I'm Corey doing was another one they all like fell off the face of their [noise] I mean not wrong are no cars Jeremy Hill is nothing now he's with the patriots and you don't see a single thing about him only got hurt and he's out for a year\nYeah ... do you know reaping hard was another one too Giovanni Bernard lost all hope for I don't see much of it yeah there there's a lot of potential with him but since he got injured and all that I'm just first\nFirst couple of years of his career look on very solid very good running back and then all of a sudden the injuries pile up and injuries we've seen over and over injuries damage players careers now of a finger\nYeah that's a lot of people would say ... years he's had like a lot of nice going out and they would say you can't play more heating care he just went for if he just he just went forward after this after the second the just on he was done after that but um [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't think there's anything anything else you guys are thinking of laugh out in ... now it's gonna be a decent wait\nFor NFL a lot of a five hundred teams going against each other if not lowering team so it's going to be a boring weekend both can be decent\nAnd marriage is Thomas will still be at Denver get the team play the Denver to speak to that that's interesting right after the trade\nThat's an interesting thing playing his former team right after being traded to\nBut I don't expect anything but I'm open hearts from the Broncos I don't there was no bad blood between there so it's gonna be it's gonna be a warm reception\nNo you know von Miller he doesn't really hold grudges too much that I've seen so far yeah I don't think he'd hold on to Mars Thomas I don't know as a sports cars going there because it wasn't his fault for being traded even though he kept probably helped himself if he wasn't bad at the time\nYou get asked to leave that now that we're trying to do\nJimmy Butler was one player that's one demanding a trade and the ... will I Would too that that seems just I wanted I think the chores I have a salty there there's potential ... very much but we'll we'll take a short break with some\nYou're listening to sports talk live on Ninety plus one W. I. U. P. in Pennsylvania [noise]\nNow to try not\n\nTo put in perspective I think that was close that I've seen it but um one thing I Want to bring up is Josh Harrison declining his option or the pirates declined his club option for developing Ninety\nDefense he's ... I think he's a gold glove award winner he's been too if you all star games he's been one of your top players they just had a bad season I don't know why the virus declines option I think is the top player on ... on exactly but you know what I think they're going through the garbage and they declined his option\nAnd they're going to ... Mercer back 'cause that's just how the pirates are they don't care they just whatever saves them payroll whatever gives Bob nothing more money\n... good defensively somewhat but not that great and the hitter really and he's got to contact ... history I mean on average is [noise]\nYeah he's not he wasn't meant for home runs he especially coming down from double A. whenever he and his first season\nMeant as a power hitters more of a contact speed guy\n[noise] you know there are kind of went off course that that's fine honestly that's that eat some time now [laughter]\nNow move onto the NHL 'cause I Know probably Michael I mean yeah wants to talk about any Joe or Austin sorry [laughter]\nSo do you get all being Late Show is always good I mean sure\nBecause they see that the Phillies and the ... the ... I mean like I said well Philadelphia Flyers and makes a penguin Philadelphia Grady there you go that's better for it as a two thousand nine game that's outside the stadium series\nStates where it's coming up and um yeah whoever your ... financial field\nWhether shown some ads already on the NHL dot com site [noise] as a matter of get pumped for I'm I'm a ... one of the biggest rivals\nIn sports I think honestly I mean it's always a good game between the flowers and penguins they both had was numbers well it's always a fun game outside and that's what makes it better I mean the one of the classics are always fun all the stadium series games are fun but it's when you're going to be really fun\nWay back in Nineteen sixty seven when the expansion\nWhen dominated them later on with some new and Crosby now so\n[noise]\nUh but hey ... penguins ... now he's gonna be out for a little bit of what exactly injury is but yeah because he's gone down for a few games um that's definitely going to hurt the well I wouldn't even say it hurts the penguins for mission well they they have a few in\nMount ... across the that's one of them get hurt they still performed followed\nYeah I mean honestly they have a lot of town on that team I mean mouth and the Crosby are the two headed most\nYeah they ... they always got solid backups for some reason I Know the capital thing it's going to put a damper on it but not too much words can affect their overall record\nYeah um [noise]\nOh [noise]\nUh I Know ... you want to talk about NASCAR now 'cause ... wins that race\nWhat a horrible and that race that was the worst act of sportsmanship I've seen in my life alright Joe ... who wins the whole thing true at the gate iPads cleanly inside on the tight a paper clip it comes up\nSmashed him on his side to get side draft and passes them to go\nAnd then on the final that hit the cold Joey arrogant or gone himself comes in and lack some and wrecked some on the wall and why do you know he wins just the usual what a punk\nClay I like to go and I think he's a solid racer nice pit crew he can I just actually tiny green radical age I think he's a ...\nI don't know I just had a ... not a good feeling once he came and took Tony store it's like um\nAnd now it just rub me the wrong way I'm not a Tony Stuart fan but I'm I'm about it it was just some that rubbed me the wrong way about it for some reason\nI understand I was Tony Stewart fan growing up uh um but yeah and to see that that's one thing I disagree with is that he took his signature Home Depot sponsorship but I mean\nAnd Tony Stuart noted the whole story hospice team right after that one at least one last championship for himself\nFor everyone else took over now on to our I don't know about our favorite one but coach football is one that's going to be interesting 'cause the final fours decide who might yeah ray [laughter]\n'cause see Alabama Clemson LSU and Notre Dame or your top four teams right now\nHere's where they have to say to LSU yes when baby [noise] and you'll make it at a college football playoff that's like al Davis now in the good old raiders now and surprising fashion Kentucky's a number nine in all of them yeah but I thought well you fans running\nThis week is that your ... go with enough things out strongly against Georgia\nAt you know I agree with that statement grace I'm In Georgia and Kentucky but at the same overall record but its upset season and it's in Kentucky a service that so ...\nYears if that's the only way but [noise]\nI haven't been up that high and like forever I think it's probably not in a hundred years almost yeah they're kinda like we're looking at it and see a basketball yeah\nAnother idea right [laughter] oh well but the U.S team but [noise] but you ... I don't get how to use the F is not hire a release moved out\nBecause they have a player ranked team oh you're a player ranked team all year University of southern Florida law was passed we can do so you see yeah uh yeah they might go on but if if they try and do that nonsense where they came in I\nI go down to I go down there and just\nRead gone to slap someone else other hadn't\nOh I don't know about that but I Need to talk to them and so if you want to\nSay that you should be in the national championship game then place one someone alleys and you're not non conference scheduled for Houston but they used in this year\nUCF might lose the temple the more night to get there on a five game win streak and they're riding hot right now of all looking\nStrong winning the last several games but I don't think I've seen that they were or your back where they were rang but I just think that UCF team at this point they're just another undefeated team and they're not going to go anywhere\nBut when did you say the peach bowl but when you say the same thing about Alabama because they pick yeah they don't\nPlay many tough schools they're pretty easy so every year they have the chance of going undefeated their their toughest about this this is against this week against LSU I'm not going to make any predictions say who wins or who loses because I Know we have a lot of Alabama spores are we going to have some LSU supporters in the booth without so I don't want to make anyone matter wrestler Jimmy's I'm [laughter]\nI'm not saying Alabama supporter I'm saying like oh okay yeah I mean yeah\nAlabama has the benefit of the doubt though since for their division the SEC west juries\n\nYeah you got to show up like the Oregon team back when they first started the national championship\nThat's very interesting choices I'm very interested in I think that was nice to\nKnow what age I really expect you to play like the markets wrestle that versus Ohio State and the national championship game back into than than than who re having some bad memories Steven [laughter]\nGame and long game Ohio team at your own that we lose one national championship I'm used to

Scott is that its impact on the ground and the daily lives of African Americans is very limited\nVery few chords are willing to enforce the literal terms of Dred Scott in um the cases that they hear um state legislatures are not prepared to defer to the courts reasoning and African Americans even in the face of the dust devastating rhetoric and Dred Scott continue to win\nAs a historian teaching at a university\nOn how little knowledge there is of history and and when you refer and just in Dred Scott\nExplain who he is and his crusading attempt to challenge this and how um the amendment comes out of what this perhaps most race since decision of the U.S Supreme Court but it came out of activism it came out of dread Scott's bravery who was the\nI'm Scott isn't in slave man in the city of St Louis Missouri\nI'm his case arises because in the company of his owner Scott travels to free territory I'm among those places Minnesota\nAnd the claim had long been persons who um were held as slaves but reside at and free soil became free themselves now Scott\nI'm live in these Minnesota Territory he meets his wife Harriet or they begin to have a family they marry and then finally they return to St Louis where they are still held as slaves and by the early Eighteen fifty I think they are concerned that\nUm they might be sold that their family might be separated um they're always at risk as enslaved people and they begin what is as you as you explain a series of freedom suits um a tireless effort to secure the freedom for themselves and for their two daughters\nOn these cases make their way through the Missouri state courts um and when they fail their wind up before the U.S Supreme Court um their chief justice Roger Tony I'm now notoriously pens and opinion on that I'm deprived the Scott family of pursuing\nAfrican American slave or free can bring claims before the same high court Venus so\nCould you took a certain through water happens after a subsequent to the civil war when the fourteenth amendment is adopted and the and the intention of Congress are and the ... with the passage of the fourteenth amendment\n... so I'm African Americans are going to be um among the first to attempt to volunteer\nI'm In the civil war era to serve and to support the union army um their view is that this is an extension of their long quest for citizenship\nThat military service service to the nation this capacity might further open the door or make their case I'm for their status citizens\nUm the thirteenth amendment as we know in Eighteen sixty five will abolish slavery\nBut the thirteenth amendment does not comment on the status of African Americans before the law before the constitution this is still an unresolved question and the campaign to the fourteenth amendment is precisely designed to respond to that long campaign that African Americans have\nA waged it is to um resolve the kinds of ambiguities the kinds of dangerous the kinds of ... the former slaves face without\nA resort to the status their status as citizens and so in Eighteen sixty eight um after Congress has um promulgated fourteenth amendment the states will ratify\nIt and for the first time the U.S constitution will provide that all persons born in the United states are citizens of the United states it is a remedy a radical\nA lasting and enduring effect which is to make every person regardless of race and I might say regardless of religion regardless of dissent regardless of political affiliations make every person born in the United states citizen of the United states\nBut not during the debate over the fourteenth amendment because there are some a relatively small number of scholars who support the viewpoint of Trump's that a\nGood birthright citizenship has been incorrectly of a interpreted a book that but even then in the debate wasn't there a debate as to whether this this uh amendment would extend to people who were or or where the children born here of immigrants\nImmigrants are not what troubles Congress um during the fourteenth amendment debates on what Congress is concerned about when it cars out an exception to the fourteenth amendment for people not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states what Congress is concerned about are three things\nI'm One of the children of foreign diplomats who might\nAh incidentally be born in the United states the fourteenth amendment does not make them birthright citizens\nCongress anticipate the possibility that the U.S would be occupied by a foreign army and in that case the children of soldiers a foreign army would not be birthright citizenship even if they were born in the United states\nThe third category of persons who Congress is mindful of our Native Americans and here um we're in an era where native communities native nations um continue to exert and to enjoy the independents sovereignty 'em and Congress\nCitizens that will happen later in the twentieth century\nBut it's just say that no Congress has not thinking about um what today we might term an authorized or illegal immigrants on but it does carve out an exception for persons who are said to be not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and this is the language that\nI'm a President Trump and others have seized upon as they have looked to constrain or retail the effect of the fourteenth amendment\nWell you know when we were covering the protests around the killing of Michael Brown a few years ago and fluorescent diving you are in Ferguson, Missouri just a few miles down that same road is the cavalry cemetery where Dred Scott was a buried\n'em but I wanted to go beyond the Dred Scott and talk about other cases I you look at in birthright citizens I wanted to ask you about one Kim arc that Chinese American cook who was born in San Francisco and Eighteen Seventy three at the center of a major but often overlook Supreme Court decision regarding birthright citizenship\nUnited States versus ... tell us what this court cases about who won came our was and why it matters today\nSo I'm One Kmart is essential for understanding where we are today because he is I'm a son of Chinese immigrants born in the city of San Francisco\nUm he appears to be a birthright citizen I think regards himself as such even his his parents are not eligible to natural allies um by what become the terms of of the Chinese exclusion act\nI'm so one Kim arc on does business in San Francisco um business\nTo return at the port of San Francisco he like many other people have Chinese descent is detained at the port and is charged with being a non citizen\nI'm of the United states why um because of this curious language and the fourteenth amendment about being subject to the jurisdiction of the United states\nThe argument on behalf of customs officials goes that a a Chinese American born in the U.S to non citizen parents I'm In like his parents I'm Still\nHolding an allegiance to the emperor of China I'm Still foreign even as he was born on us soil and one Kim arc must take his claim to US citizenship all the way to the U.S Supreme Court\nThey're an Eighteen Ninety eight the court will examine the facts will return to the fourteenth amendment and conclude unequivocally that long Kim arc\nDespite the fact that his parents are not eligible for US citizenship he himself by virtue his birth in San Francisco is a citizen and has the right among other things to come and to go at well\nLet's go to vice president Mike Pence speaking to Politico on Tuesday\nWe welcome you both to democracy now Bruno ... too high let's begin with you in Sao paolo your response to the election of both NATO who won by quite a margin why and what do you think\nWell it's a hard\nDemocracy such\nAs ours are I think he won for several\nReasons is very difficult to\n... points just a single one but I think it's the result of many many years of a criminal invasion of the political class in Brazil or this is a long time\nComing it started a way that being a operations\nThat the police the federal police and the decision is Cherie\nUh did in Brazil are but the fact is a mini saw this coming but the political establishment couldn't believe it was possible I'm most so NATO also a re presents or the\nMilitary dictatorship ... in the country which is which is pretty pretty strong\nBut I also have to say something that not many people who are um put on the table which is there is a ... a psychology things are happening here in\nBrazil there is the fact that they left in Brazil is being\nCriminalize and demonize for quite a while\nSo both ... results of many many things\nAh it's hard to pinpoint just one reason\nJames ... a professor James screen I'd like to ask you in terms of the impact of the ... elections which did not get a whole lot of coverage here in the United states on Latin America and really the ... democracies across the the\nShow or Japan or and so what happens in Brazil really has a big impact or certainly across Latin America because it represents a about half of all in the south America's population\nI think that the election and Brazil reflects an international trend that we've been following in Russia in the Philippines in Poland and Hungary in the United states and conservative governments that come to power in Chile and Argentina and by the way\nA and the ... government which I Would consider worse than the Trump Administration is probably going to be a implementing a series of extremely reactionary changes to the country which will see a decline in the Senate of living of ordinary people are working class people\nIn addition to attacking the environments are tearing up international agreements a day for us being the Amazon region and a\nChallenging the Democratic rights of el ... community the women the black moving in Brazil all of which have been fighting for the last Thirty years for full a democratic rights in the country\nI mean here in this country I think I'm a a report said something like Seventy five percent of the Brazilian eight expatriates around three quarters of the Brazilian expatriates voted for\n'em and voted for both NATO that's former army captain and praises the military dictatorship attacks gays attacks women on and I and then talk about the issue do explain this professor grain\nSo that there's no question that there is popular support for ... for NATO who seems to be the savior for the country who is going to offer a simple solution is a very complex problems his solution to increase violence criminality is to arm all citizens or his solution to a criticisms\nWhen they go into a community and shoot to kill 'em in this regard I think immigrants people who've left the country and other moments I'm\nAll into the category of those in Brazil who are listening to these ideas that boasting that it has and hoping that they will solve very complex problems with his simple solutions\nUm the humidity is very diverse in this country I think there are a large number of Brazilians who have been very consistently supporting the fight for democracy in Brazil and I've been very vocal about they do remain a minority of the community in this in the United states\nAnd I'm Bruno I talked to in terms of the racial and class implications of this election clearly under certainly under the workers' party for the first time indigenous people and and are afro Brazilians started to have more\nRights and more of a tension and services and affirmative action from the government what do you envision happening or under a under also NATO\n\nOr he didn't ah he's not the president a yet but if you follow the last a couple of a couple of days here in Brazil there is a radio violent attacks on ...\n... in a in a the Amazon and the fact is that this man made his political career I fighting a very strong and uh aspect of their president in\nHistory we changed the oppression of them [laughter] I'm I'm Sorry 'cause I'm studying a lot\nAnd he unleashed he uh outcries the meat Atari police in Brazil which is very uh I'm I'm a logical ah so I'm act even if he's not getting the proper um\nOrder so it's gonna be hard\nYou know it's gonna be hard it was in a something that was in clear and these dark aspect of the Brazilian spirits ah won the election so um it's going to take a lot of a organization and\nA lot of support from the international community how ... Bruno how are people recognize saying look in Brazil to stop this we're not how people organize on his side to criminalize all activism in Brazil\nYes yeah he\nSaying this he's saying this for quite a while he's saying that he was putting prison kill our sense so the exile the uh he's a opposition and he said that he points out final stop on all kind of a acted as I'm\nSo people are starting to reorganize and we don't know yet\nWhat our a response will uh be uh yesterday there was the first peaceful protest or to say that we won't stand us and there was a lot of police brutality hidden from Palo there are people who were arrested people who are already\nBitten by the police which I think will be the main problem here in Brazil the military police has become an ideological\nAnd you know it's going to be hard times\nOh we're not going to be here in Brazil but we needed more than ever\nWe are going to break and then come back to this discussion furniture too high as a journalist photographer founder and editor of the studio fluke so an independent media outlet based in Sao paolo who faces very serious pressure I'm James Green with us from Rhode Island she's a professor Brazilian history and culture at Brown university past\nPressing the Brazilian studies association a fungus books we cannot remain silent opposition to the Brazilian military dictatorship and the United states will be back with them and thirty seconds\nMean to\nDemocracy now\nI mean he goes then would fund and solace we're talking about the election of the far right army captain I'm ah in Brazil right now Jay year both in auto um our gas in Sao paolo Brazil Bruno ...\nJournalists photographer founder and editor or studio fluke so an independent media outlet based in Sao paolo also founded the Brazilian digital collective media ninja\n\n\nNa\n\n\nNa na na na\nNa\n\n\n...\nBought out and do ... do you get when you got me down not hard to get down to the ... and now that I'm dreaming overdue now isn't that the nice thing to do when a young guy\nDo\nBeen really strange to\nThey give me and you can get Kelly easily yeah lady\nAnd helping lend by hand when my mind went up to candy land my God I Am a ... and the album diesel the day you know like on the journey back anyway but\nShe may feel really bad so\nChina girls get die right in with them\nPlenty but you weren't getting my psyche and I think he can go next all along\nThe way we belong to the doctor and a lot [noise]\n\nGive me a nice nice\nWrong\n[noise]\n\n\n\n...\nAnd ... or ... and and\nMhm\nYou are listening to Indiana's very on college radio station that any point one W.
