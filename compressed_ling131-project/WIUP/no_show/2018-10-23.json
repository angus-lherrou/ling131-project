then you know the the topic is so um [noise]\nHeavy and causes so much despair that I was reluctant to do that sort of deep dive at the subject required\nOnce you've made that choice to make a literal underground railroad does that free you up then to to play with the subject\nWell I mean it means that it's not historically accurate or from the very conception you know when she steps into the underground railroad into literal train or we're not in America anymore when a fantastic space and so\nYou know there's one story about slavery north than that ah that's historically accurate and would I Do as I Move different historical periods around an event and allows for a larger discussion of American history um what happens if you compare the treatment of African Americans under slavery to [noise] ah say nineteenth century when\nA therefore sterilization medical experiments how can we put those two different attitudes towards a black Americans bodies are together and so it allows for a much more dynamic I think a exploration of our history I've heard\nYou say that not sticking to the facts allowed you to combine different forms of racial hysteria health so\n[noise] well um you know but not sticking to the facts are 'cause my motto is that like when you stick to the fact that he gets with larger truth so how does\nTheories you know they they got all other scientific racism and ideas about racial purity for American scientists and so if you take\nUm the racial chair of the late Nineteen century in the Jim Crow laws um lynching and take them to the logical conclusion you get something like Nazi Germany so um\n[noise] uh by\nDeviating from historical fact I can take different um periods and putting together and try to get some sort of friction and different kind of a a spark in the imagination of the reader\nTell us about Cora and how she became the the central figure and and really the center of the novel would so\nWell I mean I'm when I first got the idea I thought oh it's a male slave running north and then a couple of years later oh maybe it's a\n... has been looking for a spouse who's been sold off and then I settled on the mother daughter dynamic between ... and her and her mother I I'd had a string of male protagonists in my previous novels and a voice in the back of my head was saying don't do the same thing over and over people will catch on to your\nYour mail narrators and so um it seemed to mix it up having a female protagonist and then you know the ... the dilemma the female slave I'm\nSeeing where they've exploring you know um there's a woman in Harriet Jacobs who are the slave narrative and she describes having a slave girl becomes asleep woman she enters into a much more terrible form of of um a bondage\n... ah you're now subject to your masters desires if you weren't already um you're supposed to pump out babies cause more babies means more slaves and more property master and so that just seemed were the other other exploring\nIs young slave on a cot in plantation in Georgia when we meet her\nI think it takes a dynamic personality to um conceive of a a place of hope in the north and to a follow up on that I'm not hope to run away and the risk being captured tortured or killed even\nAnd so um [noise] you know she has a different she's very spirited [laughter] and um of all the people on the plantations she and her you know combat Caesar or the only ones who are are you know can conceive of a running away and it takes a certain kind of heroism you know takes courage to stay in the plantation and maybe protect your kids\nBut also a very potent personality to actually take that first step off the plantation in\nThose steps from Georgia to South Carolina to North Carolina how'd you those places differ you you write so beautifully about the experience that she has an and they are very different experiences\nWell yeah so yeah the book of Serbia booting every sixty pages of the with with each state she goes through and so she emerges in the tunnel in South Carolina and it's a ... a seemingly benevolence a state\nOf slaves are are freed they're given housing\nAnd education and jobs but of course everything's not as it seems in North Carolina you know I was talking a Nazi Germany earlier um North Carolina is a white supremacist state where\nThe racial laws of the nineteenth century are taking to the logical conclusion and that that's a different sort of cultural economy than South Carolina so each state\nOr I sort of tweak an exaggerate an an altar um different moment in history and corps has a sort of navigate them you know I think that you know the structure I used to describe us go to travel 'cause I was a sort of common way to describe it but it goes back to the odyssey where\nAnd then going out to the next\n... Whitehead has just been named New York state author his latest book is the underground railroad published by anchor [noise]\nThere's a point in the section in North Carolina where Cora is trapped in an attic it overlooks the park and there is a lynching festival there every Friday\nAnd it is a it is so a a bleak and yet striking scene in the novel what rings or to that point and ultimately what she learns from witnessing that experience\nYet in North Carolina uh she's trapped in an addict but can overlook this Friday festival over they have music and dancing and the culmination of lynching and um that's not lynchings generally happened in the in the south in the nineteenth century or the twentieth century up but they weren't entertainment you know you would\nYou have someone in custody and then you take up when the jailing string them up and you invite the whole family you know grandma little Suzie and you know some of the early American photographs or or lynchings there on postcards and the whole town is there a I'm smiling while this\nA dead black person is hanging or or burned alive\nUm and so um it wasn't that came in and I sort of fallen into mental mental shows and and music and dancing to um underscore how they were you know these kind of um entertainment's a what does she learn well you know she's a\nShe's an observer in in that moment and part of the book is about navigating her movement towards personhood um she starts off with a piece of property and object she's gays upon in the in the fields um she has no agency and in South Carolina North Carolina she starts dating back\nWhat is her ... as you saw it in in writing the novel what did you want her ultimate goal to be what what did you want her to to feel was the the ultimate goal [noise]\nWell I mean I'm you know what would you leave she has an idea that a a freedom in the north it's maybe having a job in starting a family and being independent and of course all these different states she goes through a vet notion of freedom is tested and in a these different places\nAnd so she just discovering who she is she's discovering America\nAnd then and then you know the final say just coming to a um synthesis of all these different adventurers um\n[noise] uh you know I've always I was always sort of right I was always right at that moment I Know she'd end up in New York or Massachusetts or Canada or the west\nBut but the place and I don't want to sort of described it because it's you know to sort of the ending and bring the endpoint of her or ... or journey um but I was always getting or is that emotional recognizing that occurs in the last couple of pages where she's taking and everything's he's experienced\nAnd what you thought about the north before versus what the north actually is\nThere is also the narrative of the slave catcher in the [noise] the slave catcher who is trying to catch Cora he tried to catch her mother and failed and then determine to to catch Cora who has been looking for\nGive us a sense of of that character and what it adds to the narrative and and ultimately to [noise]\nTo coral looking for this this goal is you just described it but also alluding to someone who is after\nWell you know when you're running up when you're running away to the north it's a life or death or enterprise\nForty nine there's a new law comes into being the fugitive slave act and it means that even if you're in your runaway slave and you're in the north\nYou've been in Massachusetts for Thirty years start a family or suddenly suddenly your your master can enter into the free states and bring you back and said I mean the only stable places is Canada and the freedom you've earned\nAnd bringing needle\nThing does name little thing [noise]\n[noise] I\nMean the lady didn't make you [noise]\nYou can take my body you're getting paid by\nGetting paid by a nod my\nIntake my not getting paid\nPaid by but it's not mine do your intake my anger in vain

mask the pain\nOpioids also come with serious side effects ranging from Natasha to withdrawal symptoms to overdose as many as twenty five percent of people who are prescribed opioids struggle with addiction and those who are addicted to opioids are forty times more likely to move on to heroin\nNo one wants to leave in pain\nBut no one should put their health risk to be pain free\nThere is

service announcements brought to you by the American physical therapy association\n[noise]\nWelcome to counters fit your weekly look behind the headlines I'm Janine Jackson\nThis week on counter spin adding to the ravages brought to Puerto Rico by hurricanes Irma and Maria was the failure of the island's communication systems\nWith virtually all fell sites down many were unable to call for help or to check on others a year later the system is not fully restored\nWhat's more the U.S government shows little interest in finding out what went wrong or how to prevent it happening again\nReporter Karen McCarthy at the register notes that the FCC only seems to show interest in Puerto Rico when agency chair a jeep pies team field the chairman himself will be personally impacted by criticism\nAs when they heard Lee announced day public comment period days after learning that the G. A. O. would be releasing a critical report\nFor media activists the storm and the official response only under scored the need for the creation of communication systems grounded in community will talk to someone working on just that Teresa ... director of resilient just technologies [noise]\nAlso on the show we've just seen how a number of states and cities have changed the name of ...\nMass murderer to the people whose lives cultures and land were devastated\nBut given the indigenous peoples in the U.S today face wildly disproportionate rates of police violence incarceration sexual violence and homelessness it should be clear that a conversation that begins and ends with history is not enough\nWe'll talk about going beyond symbols with writer and educator um wrestler mon\nDirector of the community and Labour project at University of California San Diego where she is a doctoral candidate in ethnic studies that's coming up you're listening to counter spin brought you each week by the media watch group fair [noise]\nAdvocates and activists are calling on FCC chair a jeep pi to appoint an independent commission to examine the causes for communication failures in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria just over a year ago\nOver Ninety five percent of cell sites were knocked out of service hindering rescue and recovery efforts days after the storm no TV and only a handful of radio stations could function and the restoration has been painfully slow\nThe coalition of groups also urged the agency to convene public hearings in Puerto Rico so that commissioners could hear directly from Puerto Ricans on how their lives were impacted by the lack of a resilient communications infrastructure [noise]\nBut the conversation around communications in Puerto Rico is not primarily one of petitioning the powerful if anything the hurricane and the inadequate federal response have made clear or the need for other kinds of work and other places that can give people more power\n... is director of resilient just technologies as well as an artist and organizer she's just back from the case and joins us now by phone from Brooklyn welcome to counter spin ... thank you\nWell when we talk about communications failures in Puerto Rico after Maria we're talking of course about\nPeople who couldn't check on their family and friends because phones weren't working failures that may have increased the storms death toll of at least three thousand new research that's as many as five thousand human beings\nThe work you're doing it seems to grow out of recognition of the full list meaning of communications technology and storytelling and how they meet\nSo what were you doing in the case then what does or doesn't it have to do with events of the past year\nWell first off I'm I'm from Puerto Rico originally I was born there but I was raised like many of my folks were raised in the states\nBut I've continued to have a very deep connection with for the call and so in the past few years my emphasis has moved to trying to figure out really tangible ways to support\nThe process of the conversation for the call because I have been working in media for a long time prior to um this work I worked at global action project which is a youth media social justice organization so I work with young people and creating collaborative films that tells the story of what\nTheir issues are and how to resolve it and so I come from a background of storytelling myself on being the importance of storytelling not just to get our stories out there but also as a way to build community and so\nI moved into the work of technology and I started resilient just technology it as a way to kind of garner all of the things that I've learned and the people that I've been fortunate to work with to see if I could leverage all the different things that for for\nTechnology you know storytelling a whole host of things that are interconnected with the idea of communications and so I was looking to leverage all of these different ideas for organizers in the front lines of racial economic and climate justice movements\nAnd so I've been working\nHere in New York with New York city communities who are building local networks wireless networks for use in emergencies and for\nCommunity organizing and so I really wanted to figure out how to use that knowledge and relationships and understandings to support my folks in Puerto Rico and the ...\nI was going to be I guess just got back a few days ago I was in Vietnam as any comedy all to areas that for a variety of reasons have a long history both of struggle as well as of just really innovative ways of organizing communities so I was there to talk to\nCommunities who were directly impacted by the loss of the communications infrastructure following both hurricanes Irma and Maria as we saw or as we know the communication system completely failed\nAnd so the purpose of these conversations with your story circles which is a a\nCultural organizing tool that comes from the south here in the U.S\nAnd the idea is to really in community have a conversation about that's what happened to us what was the impact of that and then also talk about what is adjust communication system look like for our people are really a vision ing as well\nAnd affirming the ways in which we've been able to organize already and protect ourselves in our communities and what came out of these conversations was\nA whole lot of stuff I mean there was the clear evidence of trauma and not just not being able to reach her relatives but not being able to reach medical care not even knowing like what's happening day to day if there is access to clean water food was coming\nThank you well I read this thoughtful piece from last October by indigenous action media\nWhich states quote we're all for removing colonial symbols and nationalistic miss so long as structures such as colonialism and racism go along with them problem is they are not close quote [noise]\nIs it that gap between symbol and reality that's at the core of your concerns around indigenous people's day\nDefinitely I think those are those who worked on the streets together and we're in conversation about it we're all for the evolution of Columbus Day\nAnd we were talking about at the time the movement around the country also to take down Confederate statues to take down statues of Columbus and so we're thinking about not just holidays but also the physical\nExamples that are in our daily lives which is the statues of Confederate flags me things that are all around us\nNeeded to be addressed which was the abolition of those systems with the symbols represented\nEven though the symbol of themselves or a very traumatizing to black and indigenous and Latin next people who've been at the brunt of five hundred years of colonialism has been suffering from genocide slavery federal patriarchy and extract of capitalism\nWe didn't feel that just removing the symbol really address the historical trauma\nAnd it definitely didn't address the fact that those systems still\nOr the structure and foundation of this country\nWhere we heard it said earnestly\nYes but it's a step in the right direction but certainly in the corporate media anyway taking down the statues changing the name of holidays it's presented as a deep thrown in in a controversial wanted that you know it's still up for debate\nAnd not as part of the any plan of action in other words it's not seen as a piece of something larger it's kind of the end game\nYeah that's the problem [laughter] you know is that for most of us to\nEspecially those of us and indigenous communities who are experiencing these overwhelming statistics that and to join us women are more likely to experience disappearance sexual assault murder domestic violence than any other category of woman and\nWhere they made if people are more incarcerated than any other category are more likely to experience police brutality those are the goals that we want to focus on the end up federal patriarchy the end of rape culture\nThe end of the mass incarceration of people's color and indigenous people the end of police brutality and removing the symbol of those things it allows us to open conversation but those conversations needs to lead towards concrete action\nYou know I think there's two ways that folks react to it\nOn the one hand like I'm not criticizing indigenous people who participate in those actions because I think for for native people who participate in that what they're doing is we occupy space that has been stolen and so what they're doing\nWe have concerns that mattered that needs to be addressed ill\nAnd that there's something about that the occupation but empowering for them\nBut the way that I see institutions and cities take up the holiday is exactly opposite of that intention every occupation it's more like this multi cultural consumerism event just puts you know the exotic says I'm\nI'm indigenous culture on display for settlers to consume and that's inherently different power it\nIt shouldn't be too hard for people to imagine a city on arena and recognizing on paper\nIndigenous people while at the same time does to creating sacred sites are polluting land in water or defunding social programs and so you have to think about it isn't just that it isn't enough\nIt actually can provide a kind of cover for those kinds of behaviors\nAnd in most cases it does I mean I think if you look at\nLarge cities like you know you look at the first is it just people say it was in ... California and\nThere's been since that time were the day was commemorated ongoing desecration of alone you land desecration of graveyards desecration of sacred sites marginalization of indigenous people there and and you see that everywhere else but it's been taking up\nIn Los Angeles and Phoenix [noise]\nYou know across the board that the holiday is just you've said something to make settlers feel like they're doing something without actually doing something\nWell I remember in New York Times story around the Dakota access pipeline struggle in which the reporter\nTalked about how indigenous people want to think about going back to what time before treaties you know which first of all of course what many would want is for treaties to be honored you know but I I thought it represented a pervasive\nIt's like oh wouldn't we all like to go back to a time as clean water when we were as one with the earth you know but last we're grown ups and we know that that's just silly you know it was a throwaway phrase in this article but it seemed to me to to represent a lot about how you can\nSort of throws sympathy towards the group while at the same time to just think that they don't really have concerns that need to be actively addressed see\nI mean I'm a one had like it reinforces a lot of negative stereotypes ExxonMobil Savage but it also reinforces this idea that\nIndigenous people are are a race to be included and to be visible lives like our culture is there for the consumption versus indigenous nations having sovereignty and having the\nFirst rights to this land and also the the right of self determination and the right to protect our own people you know\nSo it kind of a live all of the concerns that that fall into broadly the work of sovereignty or the the work because of the colonization or abolition\nWell many people are if not literally young you know a newly aware in their own experience newly becoming aware of\nThe deeply painful history of this country you know when it's ongoing affects on a daily reproduction and it's very difficult knowledge to hold you know I I what would you tell them\nAbout what it would take to make indigenous people's day campaigns and not a mirror rebranding but actual platforms first struggle\nAnd I think people are trying to do this [laughter] I saw some initiative and I'm also going to acknowledge that there are many indigenous people actually working on this life and actually trying to strategize how can we use this holiday in a more effective way show one of the things is that I think if we're\nThe ongoing process of genocide nothing crush ration slavery through patriarchy that we have to start with the truth you know if you think about any authentic relationship is built on true\nWe have to be able to share the actual truth of what happened and some people use the holiday as a platform to try to get those messages out there\nSome people are trying to use it as this educational opportunity to really confront the truth of what happened and and what is ongoing what is still happening but I think beyond that you know it has to be more than just education as well\nLike our relationships with each other actually to transform and and so it does need to be part of a larger profit they\nManifest an actual material change material change in our social relation some material change in our policies you know the policies of the schools the cities that are honoring are claiming to honor people need to change their policy towards indigenous people towards the lead lead to change\nWe've been speaking with ... you can still find the peace uprooting colonialism the limitations of indigenous people's day on indigenous action dot org thank you I'm Rochelle among for joining

I Want to go to one of the migrants responding to President Trump's comments said yesterday that says millennia ... forty four year old teacher from under us from model that if\nTrump is human he should thinking reflect on what is happening why Honduras or white people migrate from their country as Trump said that if the hunt during President Juan Orlando Hernandez did not stop this\nThan there would be no economic support for Honduras so I say what support for Honduras because you never see any kind of support\nWhat does he do with the support what does Trump do with the support he gives to Honduras because Hondurans don't see anything therefore we're frustrated and tired of so much repression from our country\n... Oscar shot Kong if he could talk about at the U.S support that Trump administrative support for the president to Honduras who they call Joe I'm I at the the whole the whole idea\nOf on the contested election that people protested days on end to add that international group\nBought some for the viewer to some of these programs to understand us for a name you know what most of them may be kind of life who think he's a very often us for in a sort of like a boom and um I mean you put money ... money abroad\nBut what they have to do with the money's there than certainly for the chase either maritime by sort of Seventy says from the U.S and in the case of Central America in ... the last\nFour or five years which Indians I mean show an increase in the ... mountains of us for their names are being brightened my\n... year mark for essentially ... the and defend purposes so the parents in us history and when they start to lose me correct you know beyond that it's from the weather and the average length of not necessarily see in the\nAnd you're driving\nWant to tell you that inspired\nHalf way and I know\nDay you hear me all you can weigh and I know that\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nYou will never believe that that was genuinely the ending of both of those songs that I just played [laughter] that's a way to get into it uh\nSo like I said you heard some day by finite great to just started off then we got a little weird from this song called de de by king gives her in the lizard wizard alongside mild high club or they didn't album together called sketches of Brunswick\nAnd it's a fantastic album and it really plays as like you should listen to the entire album straight through it's a pretty short each song is like a minute or two long so that's why the ending of that song was just weirdly abrupt and kind of like\nAn all of a sudden they got into that core [laughter] I was I was just scrolling through spot by a few days ago and I thought you know what\nI used to love in like high school 'cause I was in the I was in the band in high school [noise] but uh when we would get to see like the choir rehearsed seemed like the auditorium\nAnd it's so powerful and wow no highs and lows and the just like the ... your chest rattles from all the voices and it's all just coming from like the voice of I'm using now it's crazy\nI don't know how they do it but uh anyway I thought wow why don't I look into this so everybody knows that song it was called dice are or re\nUm I don't know everybody knows and nobody knows like the full song I'm sure and not so and also I guess went into a different song that I didn't have there because I didn't want to listen\nA sort of the show with eight minutes of one song which is exactly what I'm going to do next with this song the magnificent moon by mild life\nUh this is all their albums phase\nA John [laughter] that is that the drum company wherever the drum companies with that weird fight with like the letters all drawn out and then almost looks like a foreign language\nI I'm Sorry I Know I I don't remember what the name as but if you've seen them you've seen them you know what I'm Talking about that's what are their album cover is without font and just from that I thought it was like a seventies eighties band\nOn it and you'll see why just because of how it sounds in general but uh actually it was made a few years back but this band mild life and they're from Australia down under\nBut it's it's an eight minutes on I'm not going to lie to you but it gives you plenty to listen to the whole time you won't get bored of it you'll hear the different themes just like in classical music everybody talks about the different themes that you hear played and different porridge throughout the song it's with ties everything together\nYou'll hear that here with the analog since lines\nAnd the guitar solos and singing is great\nSo just check out the song it's my favorite song of the week\nUh it's called the magnificent moon by mild life\nAnd then I'll bring it back here maybe give you a PSA maybe tell you about the weather or something or or give a shout out to my my sculpture class because we joked about that that I Would do that if I was on air and anybody listened I highly highly highly highly doubt\nThan anyone from that class has the radio turned on to Ninety point one W. I. U. P. F. M. your alternative source\nOr right this moment in time but if they are\n[laughter]\n\nYou know let her and and then I and this is by white boy sway off of it all off of his newest album the chronicles of white boy sweaty\nAnd I will explain to you after I play this one minute and Seventeen second song who in fact white boy sway is and if you figure that out before the song ends you win\nOr nothing but you win and you could call in to Seventy four three five seven nine forty seven and let me know that you just who did this white boy sway person is before the song ends\nBut for now enjoy don't ruin the song just listen to it it's a fun song that's all I'm going to say you and I what boy sway the chronicles of white voice way\n[noise]\nWe\nRented\nTo get\n\n[laughter] I may does the song over the summer I'm white boys sway if you didn't figure it out yes smarty pants that's me [laughter]\nI had a rough summer guys I I had a great job at discover bank back at home and then after three weeks two weeks of training in one week are real work they fired all of us all of us temporary summer employees because they weren't getting enough demand screw you discover\nAnyway [laughter] so I came back here\nBecause I don't know why why did I come back to Indiana for the rest of the summer I ended up finding a job eventually minimum wage super shoes don't ask me how that went and no I don't smoke cigarettes everybody that works there\n[laughter] so I guess I kind of naturally went a little bit stir crazy being an Indiana over the summer by myself in this big house that's meant for at least two or three people\nSo I got some music beats random stuff that I I have created a while ago and I completed them and then I decided hey I have this microphone [laughter] then I bought to do a audio books which I did one and went All right\nWhatever I still have a great Mike it's ah the yeti\nLook into that one it's like the the beginner USB make that a lot of people use on YouTube for as some are and all that stuff whatever getting off the point some meat Jake Reagan and if you know me in any capacity you would never ever ever expect me to sing nonetheless played that song for anyone\nBut I just was in the race right creative mindset where I'm like how funny would it be if I just made this album and I did and then I paid twenty five dollars to get ...\nOfficial so yes that was me the song you and I it's a great eighties be nice sang over it's this whole story from the start to the finish this dude a season this girl ... across the street\nThe song's called bad boy I'm not going to play you guys that one simply because it's so embarrassingly bad but funny so I recommend you guys look up a white boy sway on any music source and you will find me because it's not just modify it's literally\nAnywhere where you could find music you could buy my album on high dunes for six dollars why you would do that\nI don't know I'd probably get like a dollar max for like selling ten albums\nBecause it's so bad but\nThat's beside the point it's a story of this guy falls in love than he does this thing\nIt's a whole big thing I can only play a few of the songs because I curse in the other songs you're going to hear two more songs from white boy sway throughout this a two hour block here\nBut I have save those for a little bit later so for now I'm going to jump in a completely different genre of trumpet jazz\nBut it's not really jazz it's like pop trumpet music it's it's made her ... if you know Trump it if you know like brass instruments you know who he is\nHe's probably the greatest trumpet player of all time in his regards of course there's other greats Miles Davis is the best and what he does whatever made it Ferguson can play high and you can play well when he plays high\nHigh high pitched not like smoking anyway I'm going to play give it one by Maynard Ferguson and you guys can let me know what you think about that [noise]\nA\nMom [noise] um\n[laughter]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n...\nNa\nThey may be [noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nNa\n\nYou know uh I kinda feel like they should have started to fade out about a minute before they did did it really have to go on for that long after they were done\nWhatever it's a great song it's a great June it is in fact from Nineteen Seventy seven the band heat wave it is it they're off of their second album\nIn the song he's titled central heating I really love the I'm covered you guys should definitely look it up for yourselves it's super retro in it has like a little a heater down at the bottom right of the album cover it's just really nice to look at the steadily pleasing one might say\nA talking about the fate out boy do I have a good transition that I thought about the second before I came back on the air here right now a fading out is kind of a ironically street\nWe can keep our attention on a song for more than that a length but to the point of fading out and it's been proven there's bunch or there's a great vox video on YouTube about fading out and music\nAnd how it's Scientifically Proven to leave songs just replaying in our heads and you want to just keep listening and listening to it again because you feel like it never ends because it just fades out and then it gets stuck in your head way more easily than a song about abruptly ends like a bunch of songs that I probably played from\nBands that are are more current\nBut uh anyway so the first fade out in music history that's been written down\nIs from the man that I'm about to play a song of his his name is Gustavo holds he is a fantastic composer back in the day he's dead now I think he's been dead for like a hundred plus years maybe not that long but he he's a dead man it's safe to say\nAnd his a piece titled the planet I Wish I could play it for you straight through the whole forty five minutes of amazing\nAh orchestra works anyway\nHe incorporated the fade out to one of his parts of the song where it's a choir and he has a women's choir in a separate room from the rest of the performers and of course there's an audience\nAnd the fate out is achieved from slowly closing the big auditorium doors on the women's choir who were still singing\nSo their voices are getting a little bit less loud but they're still pretty loud and the door closes and of course less and less sound is able to escape that door until it's completely closed\n... it's great it's a great first fade out I Would say uh but I actually just got back into him this week 'cause I had some work to do and I love I used to in like seventh and eighth grade play this while I was doing homework up in my room\nAnd I'm going to play uh the Jupiter suction\nIt's it's a bit longer it's seven minutes and forty seconds OK there I said it but it's great to give it a chance I I Would say it's a great gateway\nA to classical music that you could digest like a normal person could just listen to and enjoy it there's not like a bunch of weird wrong does that make you feel weird about yourself and while you're listening to\nUh you're going to say oh it sounds like Star Wars music odds because John Williams blatantly was inspired by Gustavo\nHost host host\nYeah OK I'm standing right by Gustavo man\nUh you know all of his Star Wars music and any competition that John Williams has really made not saying that the star's music is better were rip off it's just greatly highly highly inspired by a this ... the planets number thirty to Jupiter the bring your of joy\n\n\n[noise]\n\nJust about a month ago and I think it's just a unique song and you could feel so much of the emotion from the song even though of course most are you guys don't know what he's saying neither do I. for that matter but er\nI still really enjoy the song and I think you guys could get something out of it as well so here's ...\n[noise]\n\nDo you want to do
