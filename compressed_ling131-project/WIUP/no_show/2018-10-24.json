C. N. NBC give him so much coverage and you rarely see democratic rallies I'm sure that lives with war in Iraq about Bernie Sanders among others are giving spirited really too but I never see them it appears that the mainstream media is falling into the same trap that they were twenty sixteen\nGiving Trump millions of dollars in free advertising while shutting out the\nDemocrats and I think our listeners that's absolutely right we should not be providing so much coverage but the problem as\nIf something newsworthy happens the journalists need to be there to bear witness and share it with the people who are not in attendance or did not see the rally so we have an obligation to be there as journalists at the same time we don't want to give him all those millions of dollars that our listener so rightly made mentioned not\nYes I totally agree and and not only is he getting free coverage by having the snippets of ridiculous things that he is saying repeated and repeated and the people behind him cheering him it inadvertently lens and Arab credibility and believe ability to the things that he is saying\nSo weddings that you're doing some damage or not accurate you're saying correct\n[noise] damn I agree with both of my fellow panelists [laughter]\nI hate to do that except I Would point out that there may be a silver lining here\nSilver lining is the more you play this foolish man on the television and on the radio the angry or the Democrats get and there are a number of indications that people are really ticked off number one\nThe Democrats the first time that I can remember are vastly out raising the money even richer Republicans are able to raise the number one number two I think that the energy level of the Democratic party is now so great\nThat we see registration early voting the pollsters being all wrong\nThe time she sees Trump's face on there and she yells out things like I hate you I'm as a [laughter]\nMatter Allen does it does at the at the television while you multiply by a couple of million and that might really affect the way in which this next by election goes and there's a very good chance by the way that you're going to see a huge turnout am I talking to ... ... back to the meeting issue\nAt hand here rather than the political and please no is it there but there is not immediate intense here and I would point out that as we pointed out last week even Fox News is no longer carrying wall to wall coverage of these these rallies that Fox used to carry entirely\nThey are now even cutting away from so even the president's favorite network which is really sort of you know a closed system with the White House\nBut there is something to be said he is number one he is the president and so that is different from somebody who is aspiring to be president so you'd do pay more attention to the president if you're a journalist\nExcept for X number to do that we do equal time do we do not no no we do equal time on the president's weekly address oh yeah we give the Democrats a chance to respond or if the Democrats and president and we'd so I think that the earlier remarks by my distinguish panelists and fellow panelists um fellow panelist [laughter]\nI go and put a put out there is correct I mean there should be that way to put a Bernie rally on her second\nThere are not in fact rallies like the president's rallies being done by Bernie Sanders English before and ... they are doing some political appearances and speeches and the like but they don't do mass rallies the ways that non resident does and the president is more newsworthy you know when he goes out and\nI think that the media have an obligation to as their reporting what the president has said or the snippets of what the president has said or has said from the hundredth time too at that very\nBut immigration or whatever it is about women's rights whatever whatever the issue is that he needs to be called on for not telling the truth in a way that the media have never had to do before\nYeah real time fact checking yeah that's really hard to do and like it'd\nBe ready you know we can be ready with our list of\n[laughter] well I've actually seen them do it I mean I've seen CNN come on and say a president adjusted and that's wrong and I mean immediately real time as a you know it's happening\nNow I think you're exactly right and I don't mean to say that I think that the media were fall is in the last election that one of the ways that Donald Trump succeeded was because of the relentless coverage that he got because he was so much more interesting and all these cable networks just latches up price which is why we should stop talking about him now\nRight [laughter]\nWell unless you had enough attention to go from ... to another politician\nAnd Ted Cruz and ... and his election now he's gotten a ton of money he's still running nine points behind Ted Cruz in the election but nine points is nothing compared to an election we saw in Queens recently with the pollsters got it wrong by fifty percent\nWhat's interesting about that is that we know all this because the extensive media coverage about the races that are certainly being micro managed by the press and Mike Rowe paid attention to because of the importance of the mid term\nYeah one of the things I like about the coverage that I've seen about that race is how I've repeatedly seen the clips of white cruise has said about Trump in the past what Trump has said about cruise in the past and how you can't believe anything any of them said because they're going to say nasty things and then they're suddenly in bed with each other\nAnd that's another good thing I Know what ... call but that's another good thing that's going on the press has been able to take all of those pictures of the road guys who supposedly road guys who showed up and then they show pictures of them with the prince so it's really something\nSo through all kinds of how it fall of this one of them is the Washington Post has this blog in which they have contributors hardest and contribute to surround the community\nRogers he's chairman of the beach yard group which is a major loving for the postage told him if you don't drop Saudi Arabia as your client you will not be allowed to write for us anymore and that is I think intuitively I give up that\nI think that is fascinating because the company for homeless lobbyists works is making eighty thousand dollars a month from Saudi Arabia is our movement and they've determined they would not take any more money from Saudi Arabia while this crisis is unveiling yet revealing trusting Allen because there's for so many\nDecades we in the press have tried to say that we're going to present different points of view you can be coming from different places and now we're suddenly deciding which places you can represent who you can be affiliated with\nSo in this particular example I think it's an excellent move on the Washington Post part but I ... but I see the issues because you can go more than one way on ... to ...\nBut journalism is something about values certain values have to be representing your journalism and if the preservation of human life is not a value if you don't stand up and say we're not going to have anything to do with you if you are an associate of murderers\nWhich seems to be what is the case if you're an ally of Saudi Arabia this case I think it's entirely appropriate for the Washington Post to do this so\nBut I uh anyway interesting questions about censorship and truly does and who gets hurt and who doesn't get hurt and who has the power to have access to audiences just like this program right here we have a big responsibility here what we're saying should matter and we should be very careful in our word choice and the ideas that were choosing to\nShare on this platform it's ... I guess you know when\nWas speaking at a public gathering at a civic event last week and the guy came to me and was attacking me over something that Rosemary our mail set on this program in January of twenty Seventeen and he actually\nState of the union address and this guy was attacking me for having not taken Rosemary to task when she was going through this long piece that she was talking about so be careful because we all have guilt by association of things that each other says\nOh no [laughter] I'm not responsible for the Allen says [laughter] oh well\nIf you're just joining us it's the Media Project for Northeast Public radio I'm Rick Smith with Alan charge ...

California I'm Gloria Duffy president and CEO of the club a nonpartisan non profit public forum dedicated to airing\nDiverse views on important topics of the day some observers have complained that Americans don't listen to each other anymore instead they say American surround themselves with like minded people neither challenge them or change their mind\nWriters Deborah and James Fallows embarked on a one hundred thousand mile Journey Through American small and mid sized city meeting with civic leaders factory workers entrepreneurs in recent immigrants to learn about their challenges and opportunities they found a spirit that his reshaping our country\nAnd they came away with a hopeful vision for our future to discuss what they found we brought the Fallows together with ... director emeritus of McKinsey and company\nAnd a commonwealth club board of governors member\nTonight's program is part of our good lip series underwritten by the Bernard ocean foundation\nNow please doing Deborah and James Fallows in conversation with ...\n\nGood evening and welcome to program by the commonwealth club of Silicon Valley my name is Lenny ... don't so it's my pleasure to introduce Deborah and James Fallows authors of this fantastic book or towns a hundred thousand mile journey into the heart of America\nDeborah has written extensively on language education family work\nLove and language in addition to writing Deborah's also worked at the Pew Research center\nOxygen media and Georgetown University she received her graduate and PHD in theoretical linguistics from Harvard James Fallows has been national correspondent for the Atlantic for more than thirty five years\nReporting from Asia and Europe and across the United states\nHe previously served as a chief speechwriter for president James Carter\nAnd editor of the u._s. news and World Report James is one of the national Book Award international magazine award\nHe graduated from Harvard University and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford for the last five years James from Deborah had been traveling across the United states and the single prop airplane were delighted this evening to have them talk with us about their journey and what they discovered about America\nLadies and gentlemen please join me in welcoming James and Deborah Fallows [noise]\n\nSome German Deb welcome to Palo Alto delighted to have you here especially delighted to have you early in the conversation you're having around this country about this fabulous new book and I wanted to give a little bit more introduction to that before asking you a couple of questions about it\nSo um and we started off in in a way that we thought would be positive and easy by going to towns that\nSeemed like they had a positive they might have a positive comeback story from their challenges at and then thought only to well to be fair we needed to go to the towns that there\nThat were really challenged and and we feared for what may we might find their and bigger towns in little or towns so we feel like\nIn a town did you have a a road map or a a concierge to take you around or what what did you do how did you actually [laughter]\nSo the I I have an article in the current issue of the Atlantic that's not from the book but it it companies the book in which I say that\nThe whole process of reporting is learning what you didn't know until you showed up you know that's what we exist to do as a reporter so we would show up in these places and usually we look a little bit on the Internet to say well where is this place well how's the present itself what what's its main story\nWe'd land at the little airports which are everywhere we find some embassy sweets or motel six or with friends or with your friends your friends and and\nAnd then just start working the trap lines of going to the newspaper editor and the mayor and the school superintendent and the librarian and anybody else we'd heard of an asking\nAll of them sort of we'd say I'm Devon I both think of ourselves as essentially products of small town America and so if they were here on this project for the Atlantic just trying to\nDocument some of the story of smaller town America in this time of history so what's the story of winters California we have some friends from winters here who lured us to come to the winters what's the story of San Bernardino right near where where Katie and I grew up in red ones what's the story of\nA place as big as Columbus ohio and what are people concerned about what are they proud of where things going and who should we talk to and that was the beginning of usually a couple of weeks process\nAnd and the getting around part was was varied sometimes there were no rental cars no opening a taxi in Columbus, Mississippi we happened to land on a Sunday afternoon\nAnd there was nothing we we just we hung out there and you know finally some guy came by to pick up\nSo there was one place where he landed him the only way we could get from the airport into our lodging was this one ... character in a sort of Nineteen fifty to two trucks they work out OK worked\nOut for [laughter] touching go for a while for [laughter] them better than interesting other questionnaire about um you know this was a moment substantial journey what what did you learn about yourself during the stern\nI'm\nWell here here's one thing that that I learned um obviously Jim is the experience journalist and the family and I came to this kind of reporting very green\nAnd I was I was very um [noise] I found it took a lot of bravery to try to pretend\nTo be a journalist who to ask people questions and and I think that you would eventually get to the right answers here's an example I'm quite early in in our travels but not the very beginning um I had been going to a lot of schools and\nUm to to public places in public institutions and I thought I should go to a library\nUm we're in Burlington, Vermont and I stood outside the library and and had this conversation with myself which was you should go in there and find out what's going on and then the other side was well you know what's going on and we will read books and they do research\nBut you should really go in and see it as I said well what will I ask ... won't just to ask they'll think I'm silly so [laughter]\nIt I found it very difficult exercise to ah to feel a like that I had the right to go in to ask people about it and and what what\nThey really like to talk about themselves and it's very easy for them to to say a lot of stories particularly if they're passionate about something and they have causing we didn't just nab people are ... to start talking not usually [laughter]\nOther than the ... we did and it worked out fine but in the libraries um the librarians were extraordinarily open minded and welcoming welcoming to a degree\nReal servants of the of the public that um so so I learned about how to be a reporter and and to be brave to do that because\nWhat I learned a briefly about debt with whom we've been together since we were Eighteen is I don't know anybody else on earth we have such a continuing path of us sent in mastering new skills you've been a\nA teacher of French in a university professor and a mother and an author them you know about Chinese language and now you become in Atlantic writer and public performer so I've learned about you and I've learned that the ... the way we stay together as we keep doing new stuff right and it's so it's always interest okay\nSo you can get the national magazine and weren't I'm the most improved player [laughter]\nNot intended to marriage cash\nYou know there there are ... and Marie Slaughter just described what you wrote about is sort of the Tocqueville for the twenty first century and there's sort of a sense of at least as she was writing that there's\nSomething different going on when you're out talking about what's happening in towns that's different than the national narrative on this sort of\nThe opportunities that you saw it as something that we should feel like that's the way America's gonna renew itself or what does it mean\nSo one or both of us I think are optimistic by nature just as how we are and how how we were raised but I'm genuinely optimistic about the country based based on what we have seen\nIn the following way um I think there's a potential were actually in a moment where a different idea is going to take hold you know the idea in politics over the last ... last two years or so has been\nThis is a profoundly divided country and the kind of thing you see on the cable talk shows or carried out in the Congress right now\nThat this is a representation of how things actually are in the country\nAnd we just feel on the contrary that most of the country is busily reinventing itself in a different way and there's some way to turn the spotlight on this different kind of of American Life\nTo connect the stories to give some kind of

without their their\nMm it's not quite winner yet so we can't really complain at the moment it's nice out extent\n[laughter] yeah\nTo the extent to me it's still light to like some people were short still\nSo yeah well the same time it's still good to do stuff today like today is not a bad day to do something because it's not too hot or too cold to do something yeah that's like some of those days you just like\nFeel like giving a thing but today you just feel like kind of in the middle yeah so it is\nStay up for pm eastern time uh there's already been it's been about four big trades you [noise] and then there's a lot in my being talked about like\nApple was traded to saints yup so that they weren't even though no one I don't ... about ... yeah a picture of oh we just trade Eli where there was that was a ton of tweets like the guy just trade you lie and then like yeah and it was he like apple yeah half or it's like\nAnd then a Damien Harrison snacks went to the alliance which is where I usually don't see lines making trades that was a weird uh not too often and then\nPost high went to the jags that was a though yeah but that was still a weird innocent that that's a lead score and they got rid of him there was no one more\nThere is on the more recoup or trade oh yeah I didn't yeah 'cause that Dallas with John grew in loving of trades apparently was the first round picks now\nI mean if he's going to use them though like if it comes out to be something yeah but there's already talk of trading Derek or same at the same time too but it also talks that the teams on white car right now yeah there's a lot of\nI mean the whole team overall it's just that a lot of anger there's a law issues of like yeah well 'cause I think the biggest thing was him crying after like attack was yeah Seahawks he's a law them see if a lot of them didn't like that\nThat was the reason I think and then there's also some players saying that they don't know it'd be the next year but then there will be there next week we now [laughter] so yeah they ... they said or done making trades but I doubt they are\nYeah something comes they're gonna like on their car might be the next one out obviously so who do you think is going to be an excellent traded like who do you think not\nSo they can't get traded yeah that's that's the stupid thing too is labeling voted on foreign during the week so nothing well\nBecause they know if you report he has to sign the tenured senior traded by few reports Wednesday or Tuesday ... like for one you know taking a train right yeah so they think that's what he's doing he knows that but why won't you won't get trading yes\nHe does and what I understand that want to get trade to light the colds or like I failed or something but like they can pay you [laughter] yeah that that's the thing\nIt he's I don't know what's what he's thinking but at the same time like you're going to go to a bad team because they have the money that [laughter]\nBut you can't have both you can't have oh I Want to be a champ with a championship contender and get paid this much that's not going to happen because not every team's going to have the cap\nOr ... or a proved and knocked on pay him the hike so why do you want to stay with them yes\nBut at the same time he they're somewhat of a contention team so that would could be a reason why I guess a but besides that\nI just don't get why he's thinking at the moment it is if I was if I was at the or fan right now just say let's get rid of a period at this point I don't care if\nIf there's a limit to this crap I don't I was just won't rid of them no matter what\nThe ... being good for Europe angles than filling mall listen\nYeah but at the same time I could see like if we were talking about like say AJ green going through the situation I Would not be happy of him\nLeaving or a um disagreements or tension between people is not fun to do with friday\nOkay so since we're talking about the bangles just talking about the Bengals what happened\nAnd they want but they did invite the fall yeah and one by default\nUh [noise] I he's are way better than you just accept it I think it was more or less dome camp play on national TV\nKnow that it was like a Sunday night game prime time I don't is record not good on prime time at all and all\nHe can do splurge day night [laughter] yeah he did Thursday because I won't watch is Thursday [laughter]\nWhether it's probably a select few that do but F. L. ratings as a whole worry though so do you think they're okay\nMm\nIt really depends if they come back to what the next one yes but they play box I think next yeah so if they lose the bucks then something's wrong [laughter] 'cause what's the cheese I could I could go either way 'cause she's are tough team yeah\nAnd Patrick my homes that's just been hot yeah except for the exception was into the patriots but that's another story but\nHis that was decent that game yeah but it shows there is a weakness yeah jeeze the\nPatriots got their number apparently somehow unlike other team the rams still going undefeated like come on\nThey're losing the Green Bay the Sunday that they are losing their lives ... up if you looked at our schedule\nTheir first like seven game for all against really easy team\n[laughter] I live an alert Green Bay beating them\nI don't know about that one may idea but it ended up going to lose\nBefore they play the sheets\nThey have any more [laughter] I think they got rid of them they might of I own a healer and then a\nCrap proves that\nWhat do you think of ah the Packers like\nThey were doing really well they're winning this Sunday attacks that [noise] but like I just can't do everything now and I don't think he's a hundred percent of what he\nWas as well as whole and in the north is also in a way to 'cause you got the Vikings are kind of good the bears are looking these it in the lions even though they don't look terrible they could still\nSomehow the\nThey have the kind of like two names now has backup [laughter] ... just start\nI'm already at this point or get Dan or philosophy the great magic a quarter Vancouver led Detroit owns the [laughter] and it really liked giants\n[laughter] [noise] um I have one more question for NFL voice wet um I don't remember but that was it something about the NFC maybe\nNo I always thought the browns are around ... what do you think about right now I think Baker is the future\nFor them yeah really [laughter] you always hope for that but you never know you could bomb like any Brown's quarterback has like\nHe lost to like the worst ranked events in buccaneers sequence like he's going on everybody kind of like finished them off yes\nBut at the same time of fires there even the corner so yeah it's not like they had a little bit of a change up yeah who knows if maybe they'll become a better defund now but at the same time make me feel the need to know this\nStuff and work it out with the often doesn't or whatever\nBut there's a lot of like stop between the coordinator and the coach right now who's called plays who's not\nOh yeah because it's hard Haley pot Haley is often corner and I I think she jak summit joke saying that he got to overplay call now and like the people didn't think it was a joke and and now he says that the joke I don't think he was I think he was serious and at the time ... years but now\n... Baker needs them bacon brownies in the oven some more before they can really find there are six or ...\n... ... ... no no [laughter]\nJust right for you started among the more experience so leave him and he got him to win\nYeah you almost better than Johnny man though at this point and hide yeah so I mean yeah ... ... ... Brady Quinn [noise] but they dared gander spin for [laughter]\nIt was a lot of data lawyer is these ... like ten and six seven and then he got sick and they were seven and four and then they log yeah it's funny because he got hurt and like Tim\nCouch or one of those earlier core about how often do the like the playoffs are so\nYeah I think it was couched it was like ... or back\nOh colt McCoy [laughter] there is a classic one who was a when he was like the twenty nine year old rookie that they they they drag yeah and I think Dallas has them now or something like that either he didn't taxes either Houston or even here now and er yeah he hinted anyway he's in\nTexas um let's shift over to NBA since it's a little bit to talk about there are the raptors are\nIf the Reno for now are actually doing really well strong team the raptors and hoping to win these I watched the Sixers losing over time last night too now\nMaki ... is that right [laughter] you'll need got ... yeah he flop bad yeah my ... and I again Andrea German yeah I have a girlfriend short fifty on them and see what's better for it or don't lead\nNo ongoing him so it was it was hilarious oh well it's there to it too I'm not too worried yet no are you worried though there oh in your Lakers owned three\nAnd like the next six like they have like a cancer will stick to the game they're like some really underdog\nCoby saying like oh if they go and they all five will come back here so if I Would think about that that was the thing the same ... three three hours [laughter] he was leaving wherever he missed them yeah I seen that it's just a little sad\nBut at the same time it's like you're playing the Broncos think like you got got players like Steph Curry\nUm play Thompson that make their frugal so free throws\nLike for like eighty percent yeah and the bronze only making like Seventy or sixty\nAround there of his shots for for free throws and it's just that\nJust proves the Lakers are overrated [laughter] no it's just you know we should trade it for ... yes it does yeah instead of LeBron James [noise] but you could have gone through over at the Utah Jazz that in the late ...\nDidn't want to be with her Braun though when you're the butler they'll let them don't want to\nDo and that concern you that like next year like not to be people want to be there\nFor like ... wants to go to LA but he'll go to the clippers and he said he'll go to the clippers she thought yeah unless the raptors wrote ease somehow liking the raptors right now so we might not know he's really bringing up a shell in Toronto he's laughing awkwardly [laughter] and then he's like actually feeling\nA motion which I don't know if maybe Greg ... made him think like he can not show any above\n... or if it could be a ploy to get people to think oh let's trade for him like he's a nice person and like you to team player\nLet's say that he's prehistoric gets a perfect place for him [laughter]\nI don't know I just it's just odd but I think wasn't ... really not the most social person I think\nHe never lost burst that they are down to practice stuff he never like what if any of them he just\n... number yeah and I think if I remember correctly he's if he still does he drove like a nineties yeah whoa or something\nLike he mostly only listens to his agent and uncle which I think are the same person I'm pretty sure he does all goes it means like his agent\nYeah so I don't think I I understand where he's coming from like if you talk to too many people sometimes it just stuffed yeah wrong or skewed but when you don't talk to anyone yeah\nWell the media you don't really want to talk to them too much because you know they'll skew what you say or do you look and Dale ... yeah yeah\nYeah there's there's too much without do right now and it's not helping at all\n[laughter] I think there's too much for the Lakers right now with too much people have ... I don't even think they're even rated [laughter] like I don't I don't think they'll even like uncles they do go like five hundred and that might be a stretch to an airplane\nMaybe go see the finger in toenail clippers beat them again this year but we can't\nCount him out because you know every good team doesn't start Alka\nYeah they want to have like no one will start playing really good to like Christmas whenever I got the defenses down yeah that's what I'm afraid to fix it attuned to I'm not really\nConcerned yeah I I'm not real concern either as as you would like to see at least one or two as well it's it's a lot harder and the wife snow constantly at those losses on really yeah they're gonna hurt you or\nI liked the jazz and the west right now I think I Do like I mean I [noise] I Do I think they should have beat the lawyers I felt really I felt like sad watching that but like they're really good\nI'm really hype about the ... and I'll get some really hyped about the Denver chicken nuggets really [laughter] uh I Would have to go with the jazz more on that one I just\nI don't know why I just loved on them angel for some reason he just been\nGuard at all to metro yeah no one like the draft no one pick them up no one really thought much of a law I think this has drafting late though yeah like twenty from there but like no one really after like picked ten\nA lot of them are like people like no one really cares about all that was it was the same situation with ... who's now when he's there yeah and it just like no you a second round I don't know if people were like yeah this guy is not good but I don't know where he's just like dumping on these days where you draw shooting he dropped\nThirty seven against the spurs yeah uh yeah but I think the jazz miserable the steel yeah who to who to six or get that you're Simmons\nNo no it wasn't that fall or not have been [laughter] I'd be really upset because I was working in might have been yeah because he was a rookie last year yeah yeah\nWe could have had him and said if we have yeah but ... but at the same time would you actually pick Donovan Mitchell like not knowing how he was at the time oh no no no no no I'm just saying if we could go back now I Know yeah yeah if we need like whenever you go back now it'd be had been Tatum top two\nBowls are they still do the bowl such as\nAlways for can do the national title yeah but I feel like they just take those four and a pie and just say that a playoff team does your to your money difference now did you did a diversion for to like do like what the last year you before the Penn State didn't get any Ohio State to like have a little mad because\nI Can't they be Ohio State or something yeah things so if I remember there was like a ... there was a big controversy yeah how Penn State\nYeah and they're saying there was that a wasn't at Penn State lost the pit it was that they lost the Michigan forty nine to ten and Michigan and then a higher state beat him and\nFound out all the time ... Ohio State I think so like ... years ago it was really weird that like they got in and uh I still have hope that UCF will get to the playoffs [laughter] they go down slowly I feel like the playoff Khamenei just going to keep them at ten\nAnd like make sure they don't get it [laughter] that's that's just the feeling 'cause I'm moving down so slowly\nAnd the like the ... and ... there were ended up at twelve I think like they didn't get top ten yeah their top ten now [laughter] yeah I feel like ... I feel like you're going to be like a seven\nBanner should they should just make at the top eight now so they can always make it in and drive like [laughter] I honestly would just like to see 'cause\nThere'll be almost like March Madness somewhat you know you don't know for sure who's going 'cause I'll ever could lose out for all you know they did like a couple of times much like the last time I think that they lose the organ or something or\nOr someone Alabama they usually lose neither I see them but before the bull start to lose like but they have an easy schedule\nYeah that was here it's not easy when did they play on they'll tell you to weeks two weeks or their annual by both of them but do you think Kay say the least Allison you do you think it's\nReally going to affect them that depends on how bad ones yeah I forgot it is based on that too like how much they\nWell I Would use that for a now if they the Alabama their number one [laughter] yeah I found that died in Alabama is probably going down to ten or something some ridiculous if they do but I doubt it because\nEveryone loves Alabama's the no drama like number five rhythm when\nYeah they'll still be in the top then to be honest that's that's definitely going to happen\nBut Georgia's just not looking good either so they lose to Georgia laws that lets you and\nThat the they're playing for the Saturday you know which Florida's number nine so that that could be another team that could potentially get up there too yeah which Florida has not been good since\nThe ... T the saying okay do you think of how they can get\nBack up to ... for what do you think that's going to hurt them to like the un rank produced on ranked foreign three they don't really have\nPurdue is still able to make it to the Big Ten champions live because they haven't lost the conference game yet I Believe\nThey probably have to hope for ... ... per do just the major look good yeah along along with\nThey were even trying to beat every other team that is in that division which I think they did for the most part\nMichigan yeah at any of the goals that laugh\nAnd then you got to check the whole um Michigan versus Michigan State rivalry thing taking the field up\nOr given Bush oh yeah Darren does look he he ran up he just sat there\nAnd no one some of them it's after are locked Cain or whatever Michigan State wearing helmets and coach coming out to be honest [laughter] I don't know where to rival ... understand the whole why\n[laughter] ... you look like an idiot [laughter] flee\nAnd who who wants to pick up a player that just goes to the rival team and just starts picking up the field like\nOh I Know New York they already have a Dell\n[laughter] take up to see what are they kick some field goal met [laughter] it's kind of like people compared to in a Baker\nPut the Oklahoma Oklahoma a flag on it was a ... state yeah middle the field along with compared to that\nBut again he ripped up that put dead to paint over it and you could still see it like yeah they had no one stopped him out and then he's supposed to be like a top taken the draft yeah when it comes on line backer or something\nWhich is not looking good now 'cause he did that and you won't be professional to extent yeah for a walk 'cause no one's going we know when players have personal issues around the issues they won't get drafted or we'll get drafted but might not seeing the league\nWhen Baker what number one and like it'll stuff he's had\nYeah but he hasn't had any issues on ... I think I think\nPick 'em up well we know someone that\nThat is like the onto the perfect perfect example that she is a good line backer and all that has so many personal issues in college so\nThat's why he went on drafted knowing that he didn't get you didn't get drought is not drafted oh I thought he was like late around early he was he was drafted when the bangles picked him up and look at he still has issues but at the same time he can be a top line backer of not\nBeing stupid yeah that way [noise]\nI'm trying to get this for quite well I don't think you'd be you know they have an exhibition basketball game versus Kentucky yeah maybe they need an exhibition football game versus K time every year they had a fake names [laughter] it was a woman last year played Yukon ooh [laughter] have lost their [laughter]\nLike you're in the last year it meant a men's basketball played Syracuse and pet expeditions but like Kentucky and that's a huge win for them this year\nYeah well you calling in the women's world is big 'cause the Yukon yeah there's always the top ... yeah it was a basketball\nIt was pretty I didn't watch it by phone they didn't win it last year the year before last Mississippi State had it\nOver a taught them enough on I ... I Can't believe Kentucky is like in the top Fifteen like seriously like come on [laughter]\nA West Virginia last Iowa State but that's the reason for that Washington last the Oregon and organs that loss in Washington state\nThat's the reason for that young yeah there was like Kentucky is gonna be like al [noise] I'll eat good Georgia they could be your double the ones that are scheduled look like\nGeorge is there any temp task laugh really in Louisville in in any hurry [laughter] I mean if Georgia State and the top ten\nHe beat Florida who does lots to thirty two straight times before they beat them again so they don't have ... opponent they have now\nLike as of right now is Georgia yeah Mm they are ... teams lose yeah there's still six ...\nYeah it was the ... there's a lot of teams there are no undefeated no really it looks like down to like Alabama clam\nChowder game who ... who isn't that good do you see 'em a and that's it no F South Florida South Florida that's where they don't move they haven't like moved\nOut funny now I feel bad that like the seven now and yet they can't\nYeah I just get out there in the American half of my car and read them not\nGet how the system works 'cause it's not panning out because you have one team always winning\nOr it's based on how you can schedule to determine like two years in advance three years in advance actually twelve years in jail I mean we had to go the chef forgot [laughter] but yeah so like or anything\nElse that you can't flights I Want to use a I guess I'll use\nTypes of things and all they have all these like teen schedule and the next ... one year to all the teams to be ranked and you're like oh crap [laughter] like Alabama always schedules easy people\nYeah which on purpose to schedule on it and where like do really close to Alabama that's the joke paternal away schedule stupid teams and you'll just don't see how they get\nLike how they're in the top with their schedule like that though if you pick an easy\nIt's called the destroying the destroying them have faith anybody yet they're the ... to ... gallons and they always played ... we'll see you at all or do they play in Auburn they have to plan on November ...\nScheduled has their play like you you would be a net in Alabama so it's not really on the way a game like they they just how they do it they make sure they don't have to go that far\nYou know I mean you think like if they really want to be high up there they would want to go against those top T.\nAnd I'm One of my friends that need them I Love the community or a ...

the vote is also about creating an atmosphere of fear making people worried that their votes don't count\nHave more on Georgia and the upcoming mid term elections later in the broadcast in Iraq a car bomb blast\nOutside of market in northern town near Mosul killed at least six people and wounded thirty out there is no group has claimed responsibility but Iraqi forces claimed ISIS was behind the attack\nIn France police removed close to two thousand refugees out of the ... camp and the northern city of Dunkirk the camp\nHas become a central hubs for migrants attempting to reach the u._k. after the nearby Calais refugee camp known as the jungle was demolished in two thousand sixteen\nGrand sons was built is a joint effort between the mayor of grants and Doctors Without borders but it's become a political flashpoint in France and authorities of attempted to camp residents several times already this year President Trump lashed\nOut again Tuesday at the Central American migrants caravan\nUm and really played out as these as these two contenders to very polarizing and very opposite opinions on a very contentious issue\nOh professionally or writing with regard like trash you about the the Rolling Stone release of abuse audio all book Kemp talking to some donors about who's concerned about too many people voting\n[noise] absolutely I mean I'm this is not actually a new concerns are the Republicans for a very long time um have had very open conversations and other cases a very private conversations about they're concerned about turnout\nAnd why is that because the higher the turnout particularly amongst groups of color a particularly amongst young people tends to favor democratic candidates\nIn this case Stacey Abrams has really taken you know what what should be a novel ... what is a novel approach by going out and pounding the pavement and going after\nA non likely unlikely voters voters who haven't voted before young people people of color getting them to try and turn out I'm at high numbers and so if you're Brian Kemp\nThat is something that you absolutely don't want and so in his you know in his private remarks or this is essentially what he said which is we don't want these people coming out and voting we we you know we have to think about what are the alternatives are and how can we not get them to come out even though that's their legal and constitutional rights\nIn it we're going to go to a break and come back this discussion will also bring in Greg palace Jewish suing the secretary of state camp I'm Leah Wright rigor is going to stay with us professor at the Kennedy School of government at Harvard University well\nGo participating in a flag burning up the Confederate flag of Georgia at the time that led to the flag being\nReplaced gotten rid of the democracy ... stay with us [noise]\n\n\n\nEnsuring natural indeed this is democracy now I mean the good men with Juan Gonzales\nAs we continue to look at voter suppression in Georgia a new investigation has found that Georgia secretary of state and Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp\nHas overseen the removal of more than three hundred and forty thousand current Georgia residents from voting rolls in a moment we will be joined by journalist Greg palace but first I Want to turn to party\nHundred and fifty thousand voters he used the postcard drink camp sent out millions\nOf these cards requiring voters to confirm their addresses problem they look like junk mail eight out of ten voters get them throw them away throw away the card and cameras can throw you off the rolls the trick and not everyone gets a postcard mostly they go to neighborhoods like this\nThis is my neighborhood and this is where I almost got birds\nStacey Hopkins is a community organizer and\nYou give me hope that this is also a community that's rapidly changing impacts us as a voting community with all these empty houses are voters being lost our political power is being lost\nWhen camp sent her a postcard he picked the wrong target\nI look at things now is that they're telling me and two of my children that if we did not fill out forms and return them we were going to be moved to the inactive list but we're just voted by decided to\nTry and hold a list of camp accountable for that because I wanted to know why you didn't want me to vote we filed suit against secretary of state county\nAnd she won big time\nA hundred and fifty nine thousand or restore to the voting rolls and that was that was a good feeling\nBut what feels bad is that more than half\nA million voters remain on the purge list we had to threaten camp with a federal lawsuit but he finally gave up the names of every voter he perched then we made all the names public I was flooded with Nineteen hundred emails from Georgians stunned they had lost their right to vote\nInvestigative journalist Greg palace tempted to question Georgia secretary of state the Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian can about the purge\nWas removing black motorist\n\nRight now is there any other reporter being thrown out as you\nSaid that scribes palace questioning the Republican candidate for governor Brian can push the secretary of state grant Palestine journalist has been investigating camp and father's suppression in Georgia and director of the ... documentary titled the best democracy money can buy\nYou are suing Brian Kemp as well Greg palace to explain what you found and why are showing him\nWell you see wouldn't answer my question so he's going to have to answer them in the federal courts as a follow up to my Rolling Stone to thousands sixteen\nInvestigation uh we're suing him and I say we including a civil rights organization to find out why he's remove three hundred and forty thousand one hundred thirty for Georgians\nOn suppose it evidence that they've left the state\nOr left their county and they are in there are still in their home registration address if they haven't left to talk to a third of a million people if these people show up to vote\nA on a November six they're going to find that they cancelled the we ended up provisional ballot but it won't be counted this was huge and the these lists are violently\nRacially prejudiced so we're going into court to get all the answers why did this we know what's wrong and from my other investigations was able to get inside his uh his operation and get the some of the purge list before\nIt's quite an ugly operation I've never seen a purge operation this why this big and this one thing that Stacey Abrams was mentioning during the debate it's not just the fifty three thousand names pending\nIt's the three hundred and forty thousand people heard that is their registration have been canceled that's why we're in court with the voting rights groups to get the information on exactly what\n... and various or national elections I think back to\nKatherine Harris in front of Florida during the infamous off of Florida recount vote and the Persian Gulf ... are suppose felons ... from the Florida voting list\nKenneth Blackwell another Republican secretary of state in Ohio during the two thousand four elections we've heard about Chris called back in Kansas and now camp\nIn Georgia this this secretary of state position rarely gets a lot of attention\nBut when it comes to election time it's a key position isn't it\nThat's one thing that's not very well understood it's very very dangerous for Brian Kemp to be in charge of the vote while he's running for governor\nAs you said for example Kris Kobach also secretary of state and got another story coming up is closing up and moving polling stations where voters of color can't get those stations\nKIPP is doing the same thing by the way he's closed stations or if I'm In ... the voters of color in Atlanta for example in the six Georgia congressional district he he will be the one when people go to the polling stations and find they've been purged and they fill out those a provisional ballots will be Brian Kemp who decides whether they get counted\nAbsentee ballots you just heard how panic he was about the massive number of absentee ballots coming in from voters of color\nFrom Democrats and he's going to be able to decide which of those ballots get count that people don't realize you mail in your ballot you're kind of taking a chance\nThey have to decide that you're signatures correct in Georgia campus impose a rule called exact match you added your middle initial and you didn't register that way or you leave it out and you didn't register that way your ballot is toast it's gone\nThis was very serious to let a secretary of state the ballot counter the guy who determines who gets the vote which ballots get counted where the vote takes place how it takes place secretary of state camp is not following the normal procedure that is\n... other people as outsiders and uh it's Donald Trump's way of saying I'm president of these people but not those people\nAnd that's all kinds of says said the Florida gubernatorial candidate the Democrat Andrew Gillum was targeted by a racist robocall paid for by a white supremacist group Galen aiming to beat Florida's first black governor this is a clip of the ... a real warning it it's extremely gracious\n[noise]\nAnd this is the gubernatorial candidate Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum responding to these racist robocalls on CNN\nI Want to make sure that we don't racialized\nA and frankly weaponize race as a part of this process which is why I called my opponents to really work to rise above some of these things I'm a ... people are taking their cues from him from his campaign in from Donald Trump and we and we saw in Charlottesville did that could lead to real frankly dangerous outcome\nLayer right regarding your final comment on the climate right now\nWell these are races that are indicative of a much broader and ah I'm In some ways much more dangerous climate um that really ties back\nTo a really ties back to the Trump Administration and the emergence of you know a really the emergence of a much broader identity that is tied to nationalism racialized nationalism but\nThe other thing that's going on here is that we have a set of candidates\nThat um are running against people that have wholly type themselves to Donald Trump proudly tied themselves to Donald Trump and Donald Trump's agenda\nSo really what we're gearing up for it is a showdown between you know does the Trump effect still stand this one way of approaching politics uh this exclusionary way of ... a ex approaching a national politics\nIn coalition that is inclusive and his about expanding the boundaries of democracy so that all American citizens count\nWe want to thank you for being with us a lay right we're gr professor at the Kennedy School of government at Harvard University she's the author of the loneliness of the black Republican pragmatic politics and the pursuit of power grid palace journalist who's been investigating\nA Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who's running for governor and the Republican ticket ... overall it voter suppression in Georgia\nThat says democracy now when we come back on what's happening in dodge that to dodge Kansas and how a A R U S corporations profiting from ice stay with us\n\n\n... shoes or I'm\nI'm\n...\nI'm\n\nI'm\nThe flowers in Guatemala from the soundtrack to finding Oscar this is democracy now I'm Amy Goodman with Juan Gonzales [noise] well in terms of ...\nIt's more than a mile from the nearest bus stop dodge city Kansas is a nearly sixty percent Hispanic\nBut they're so see any press reports that Hispanic turnout in the county where dodge city is located was the Seventeen percent compared to sixty one percent turnout for a white voters and two thousand fourteen\nAirports digest alone polling site services Martin Luther king sours ... on average as twelve high ... polling site in other locations we're\nJoined now by Johnny ... Kansas Democratic Party is joining us from ... studying welcome to democracy now\nTell us what happened well ah\nSo this is really a one more of a saying in a larger longer problem uh a way back in two thousand two out of this the county clerk went down to just one polling place for a City Kansas [noise] um and\nIt's been that way since and that one polling place was in the more affluent white part of town I'm Don city is pretty clearly divided between like a all white or then part of town them in the Hispanic southern part of town [noise] um\nSo this move or the polling location is is really just taking a ... bad situation and making it worse because ah it's moved the polling location outside of town a sort of convenient for no one um\nAnd when you when you combine that with a historic turn out of Seventeen percent for the un has a Hispanic population has sixty one percent turnout for the white population a and then you look at uh our elected officials ah every seat we have except for the kind of conditions that large\nSo our city commission our I'm a school board or are we the College Board of trustees uh every one of those\nThe this move is is just like I said it's just one more um one more thing in a in an ongoing a problem\nAnd a giant dial up I'd like to ask you because most people are not aware that replace a comic place like dodge city of fame than the and the westward movement of Americans uh is uh is has such a high ... Latino population but it's not the only place in the Midwest throughout\nA Iowa and Kansas and Nebraska are there's been a huge surge in the last Twenty years or so of Latino population is mostly as a result of\nThe importation of Mexican labor for the meatpacking industry could you talk about that\nAssure a so in in ... specifically that influx began in the late seventies early Nineteen eighties um there are now um\nTo a large beef packing plants in a dodge city it's it's one of the uh cornerstones of our economy around here and uh those be packing plants have historically recruited folks from\nA um a points south to ah to come here and live and work and instead what we have now is a second third generation Americans who have only ever voted one polling place and don't know that it could be better\nAnd what's and what's the reason that the city clerk gifts for the long polling place forget about the fact that it's already over burden given the a devoted population but they're moving it outside of the city limits to a place where you can't even get there by public transportation\n[noise] well so uh it's it's a county clerk to the county clerk I'm I met with her and me I'm I'm a late may uh to uh you know ask her to increase the number of polling places and this is not the first time I've met with uh our county clerks\nAnd the excuses that she gives for only having one polling place frankly don't hold water I mean one of them as she said well it's a the it would increase costs to have more going places and it's just not in my budget [laughter] well\nThe thing is she writes her own budget\nUm so if something is not in our budget is because she didn't put it in her budget [noise] um and you know and then she complains about the member of a voting machines that she has and um the thing is she has enough machines to cover a the polling place\nWith a Thirteen thousand voter burden um you could take some of those machines and slip them out to other sites and you'd still have enough voting machines\nWith secretary of state as Chris come back and now he's running for governor in her ... a so called voter integrity connection for Trump to and even at at the end the Trump Administration I had to get right at that now Chris called\nBack running for governor against Democrat Laura\n[noise]\nAh well so yeah the thing is the secretary of state has to our our ... has the power to stop something like this and are approved so\nThe last eight years of Kris Kobach has signed off on one polling place in the city Kansas and really this is part of a larger narrative for him I mean he ah passed a or we we passed in in Kansas or bills as the champion you wrote\nUm that have since been declared unconstitutional because it disenfranchise voters I'm In on the ground and dodge city uh\nThat's made things difficult uh like we've we've attempted to have voting drives and things are I mean she's a voter registration drives\n\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter]\n\nNo no\n\nSuddenly na\n\nFriends [noise]\n\nUh\n\n\nNice\nTo be\nTheir own and you know\nBasically do\nAnd I watch it on and where do you go down and say you know the the yeah the other day and all that ... ...\n... men and\nWomen and men and women and men a year\nAnd a daughter and\nShe had a very well bonded and and if ... you're going to be or\nFingers up in a good you keep in mind but do they still use to\nWhat you know a guy named ... you know\nOne way or that under that you're going to stay that way I\nHave a name you use it in a band and a wrong\n... no\n...
