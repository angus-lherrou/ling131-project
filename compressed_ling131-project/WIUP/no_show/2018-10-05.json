the culture of science and technology we've been hearing about harassment and barriers to women seeking careers and politics in entertainment but what about in scientific fields science is supposed to be uniquely merit based in objective and yet\nThe data say otherwise as an example a new survey reveals widespread harassment of women of color in space\nScience meanwhile it's not Nineteen fifty anymore but apparently someone at Google didn't get the memo an engineer for the tech giant claims that women don't have the right kind of brains to do his job find out what the scientific studies say

that there were doors close to me until I started knocking on them Dr alien was born in Nineteen\nEighteen and knocked on a lot of doors on the way to winning her Nobel Prize in Nineteen eighty eight it's a familiar tale for any woman who was pursued a career in science\nAstronomer Jill Tarter also pounded on a lot of doors on her way to becoming a pioneer in her field as a young girl she had a nonstop curiosity about technology but growing up in the Nineteen fifties she found ... encourage meant for these interests she kept knocking on doors anyway\nThe gender symmetry didn't change much when she went to college Dr Tarter was the only woman in an engineering class of three hundred and went on to become one of the few females working in astronomy and eventually the field of set the the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and all of these pursuits Jill Tarter had to forge her own\nPath if you've seen the movie contact you know something about Dr Carter's single minded efforts to listen for radio signals from alien life signals that she has convinced or raining down on us from distant worlds we're talking about vast distances between the stars\nSo what can we remotely sense that might end\nNever seen the center of our galaxy at optical wavelengths because there's too much dust but we have incredibly good observations of the center of our galaxy at radio wavelengths\nNow the movie contact iconic image of Jodi foster wearing a pair of earphones sitting alone next to an array of radio antennas is a bit of poetic license says Dr Tarter she doesn't actually search for signals by listening with a headset but by monitoring a computer however\nThe scene is a kind of metaphor for a loan female astronomer in the field a city in particular eventually both science and the public caught up with Dr ... early vision astrobiology the study of the potential for life elsewhere is now a hot field and thousands of planets called exoplanets had been discovered orbiting nearby stars\nDr Tarter has devoted more than forty years to looking for extraterrestrial life and is a cofounder of the SETI Institute where we produce this show she reflects on the long arc of her career in a recent biography making contact\nWhen I was in middle school and high school we had guidance councilors who would say things to me like why do you want to take calculus you're just going to grow up and have babies as if the two are incompatible\nSo the mode of giving advice to young women was not exactly supportive of roles that we're beyond being a housewife\nSo when you heard something like that you go to your guidance counselor and you're told 'em why bother with math you're going to get married and have babies what went through your mind in your ...\nI wanted to hear I also didn't want to hear you can't take shop because you're a girl you have to take home economics and so my response to that sort of thing was usually All right I'll take home economics and I did and I learned to sell which has been a fabulous skill\nBut then when I did that you go back and you say okay I've done that now I Want to take shop\nBut I Know from long conversations I've had with Margaret bourbon choose one of my heroes a fantastic woman astronomer\nShe would express it that when you're trying for something and you're denied on merit well that's hard you work harder the next time but when you're denied because of your gender it feels like you've been kicked in the stomach and that's a feeling that I had unfortunately frequently\nWhat's remarkable about your response though is that you didn't say I was discourage you said I was kicked off and it made you want to work harder\nOh absolutely you got to get around it and if you can't go over that well you got to get around it\nThere's a story that is told in the book of your father's supervising you as you took apart a transistor a transistor radio a transistor radio and you put it back together again could you tell that story\nWould do anything to spend time with my dad and he had a shop in the garage and I would go out there and take her with him and one Christmas I was given this fantastic transistor radio which is about the size of a shoe box to me it was just the\nBe all and end all in the in the fifties and I wanted to know\nAnd with tools and so he said well taken apart let's figure it out and so I took it apart and we looked at it and I don't think we were all that enlightened by actually how it worked but he said put it back together\nAnd so I did but you know not quite there were some bits and pieces that were left on the table after I had reassembled it so I'd say\nYou look at me and he'd say do it again\nWhen did the idea of SETI first appeal to you because if we picture you\nTaking apart and putting together that transistor radio it's quite a conceptual leap to go from that and the physicality of that\nAnd the immediacy of that to than listening to radio signals that might be coming from somewhere else in the universe and can you explain to us how that leap was made\nIt certainly wasn't a straight line path in in any sense I ended up working in SETI purely it was just a lucky accident\nMy first year as a graduate student at Berkeley I was supported with a research assistant chip in my job was to program the first computer that was ever small enough to fit on a desktop was called a PD pie eight slash at\nThat piece of fear that old computer totally obsolete was given to stew Boyer um X ray astronomer in order to do SETI searches but he didn't have any money and so he went and begging and someone gave him this old computer and when he said ...\nHe came and he recruited me for his said he project it wasn't anything that was anywhere on my horizons before he walked into my office [noise] fun because I could program that old computer I ended up doing ... for the rest of my life\nBut I'm going to press you on this a bit because that's coming into cities through the interest and the talent of a computer programmer but picturing alien life somewhere else in the universe does take imagination and was there a point where\nYou find yourself thinking about aliens always wondering about it how did you light upon that\nAnd the percentage of women working in computer science has actually down since Nineteen Ninety\nThe Google memo was written in twenty Seventeen but the thinking was borrowed from another era where there were men's jobs and women's jobs\nOr if they don't get ... they can become dress Lakers cut people off at five or shot cake have not done stuff [laughter] all the girls doctors and lawyers to you know they're just going into\nThe memo was significant because it not only publicly revealed a stubborn imbalance of women in tech but because it claimed that there was science supporting it men's brains are more suited than women for tech jobs\nScience journalist Angela ... says this is a persistent myth and people are not looking at current research how science got women wrong writes missing in her book inferior she addresses the software engineers misguided memo so it wasn't as though he acts\nTo men underlying into all the documents that he used to come from various pieces of research but one of them in particular is work done by a researcher here at Cambridge University Simon Baron Cohen\nNow he is a very well respected world famous autism research but watch the parts of the hits were such as more controversial is on sex differences so he claims that there are such things as distinct male female brains\nAnd that they predispose the people who possesses male female brains to slightly different interests and hobbies\nAnd the ... or Google engineer drew his kind of inspiration from this although I have to say that having such this topic in great great detail for a number of is\nThe theory itself ... doesn't really have a great deal of evidence behind it\nWhat let me just follow up on what his point was I mean it may be that there's\nA some tendency that leads to a difference in behavior in a technical environment between men and women I don't know but on the other hand is usually what the cases is that there's so much overlap and these capabilities that it shouldn't really affect the number of female engineers I mean what what was he tried to get out here\n[noise] yes absolutely this is where it gets complicated because there is lots of research on sex differences it is one of the most fashionable fields in science right now and I never such really can tell you whatever you wanted to tell you depending on which study you happened to pick up\nIf you take any group of people and divide it down the middle you will find differences between them and that's a product to the fact that we're all different as individuals and in fact there's far more differences within the sexes and they're all between them you know we're just so different\nAnd this is why the complication comes and now I looked at\nThe story in fact there are very few differences between the sexes now\nHe was sort of hinting at a a very common idea that there are boy jobs in their girl jobs or maybe you can give an overview of the stereotypes here I mean what am I supposed to be good at what a woman's supposed to be good at\nWell there you go I myself studied engineering so I Wish somebody say that you know it's not the case that\nScience jobs or engineering or computer programming I can program compete says unnecessarily specifically for mental specifically for women like you said there is some overlap but we do have these stereotypes that sets and Chris a\nFull set to people what the guy who I met my ... James ... is that software programing used to be a female profession many of the very best computer program as well women including the very festive them old age Lovelace\nSo what was the point I mean I thought that what he was trying to do was addressed the imbalance male female imbalance at Google and Google's efforts to remedy that imbalance and saying you're never going to be able to fix this problem because of this in the difference was that what he's trying to say\nYeah that's exactly what he was trying to say that any number of diversity initiatives and not going to have an impact ultimately you're not going to have absolute parity because even if there are some social factors involved that also had biological factors\nAnd the truth is we don't have the full scientific picture about not yet we don't know to what extent those biological sex differences do impact on men and women's capability although there is such an amendment seems just very little what we do know though is that there are many many social and cultural factors\nThat do impacted so for example the take up off the subject science technology engineering and mathematics at a very young level among schoolchildren we know that\nIt was as they get older now ever since software programming computers became a kind of male dominated subject and this only happened in the late seventies eighties that's the reason Silicon Valley looks the way it does it's got really nothing to do with\nBiology as far as we can tell because we know that software programing used to be a female profession so the biological argument on purely historical grounds doesn't really seem to hold up here and I think this is the problem\nThat many people have with the memo it stopped James day most just seemed so happy to cling to these biological documents very spurious ones and quite selective rather than looking at the historical social cultural picture as a whole that explains difference\nYes then maybe some small differences here and that but they go no way absolutely no way to explaining the big gender differences we see in society\nWell let's get into that then a part of the problem here according to your book is that there is a a bias in the studies and you've already mentioned that this is a subject that the\nThe people of the study of maybe there's a gender difference there who wants to study it in fact maybe there is because a lot of studies seemed to reinforce the stereotypes at least as they applied to males and good that'd be due to the fact that a lot of the studies are conducted by males\nOn I don't know about something I have an edgy look to uh to be on his I'm done breakdown of who tends to do these studies but we have to remember this is a cultural environment so it's not just men who are finding sex differences it's also women and that's because stereotypes affects all of us I also have a copy tend to stereotypes has to you\nAnd we have to remember that these stereotypes can bias research now many scientists still insists that biased isn't a problem in science of course\nAnd this is a particular problem when you're studying humans we have very little data about the human brain we have very little data about variation amongst humans in the gap between the little that we know under a lot that we think we know because of stereotypes and speculation scientific speculation is rife\nAnd this is one of the problems happen one example that I look up in the book is a very high profile study that was done a few years ago looking at a differences in white matter in the brain so this is connectivity between different areas of the brain and it seemed to show that men have\nMore connectivity within the hemisphere is the two houses that brain on women\nHave more connectivity between the two houses that brain\nAnd and even if that was true and there's some controversy about whether it whether the funding so that she reliable or not but even if they oh what does that really tell us we need to know and yet when the papers published\nSpeculation was rife not only on the parts of the scientists who did the study but also by the public who in ... some people said it shows that women have veteran multitasking\nAnd one of the authors of the study told me himself you cannot rule that inference from these brain images so we have to be very careful that we don't kind of extrapolate too much from the little evidence that we have\nIf I were to take a scan of a brain for example I don't know an MRI whatever's appropriate scanning technology of the brain of a you know one month old baby and here's a boy maybe you're a girl babies would I Would I be able to fully they just showed me the scans would I be able to tell which one was which\nNone of us really know there is nothing you're a scientist alive who can tell the difference between a male and female brain of any age\nI can imagine that people like to speak to you at parties and dinners about all this\nJust not you where's the female boats are what are you say\nWell I think we have to remember just how different conditions with women until relatively recently\nWho are incredibly staunch believers that science is a meritocracy that the best people who do science are the ones that stay in science and they're the ones who succeeded in science they're the ones who get the best papers and the best funding\nAnd I just couldn't be further from the truth I mean what really matters in science is your pedigree what matters unfortunately it's often your identity or the number of African American female post stock that I've known over the last five to seven years\nWho um end up on every short list that they go up you know when they go up for jobs and then are always there's always a white man chosen over them and it's always they're always told afterwards oh well you interviewed really well but this other person was just a better fit for our department [noise]\nYou know these are extraordinary scientists and I'm Talking about who aren't getting these jobs so it's not that they're not good enough right they're getting the interviews\nI really think that scientists have to start paying closer attention to issues of implicit bias and interrogating this notion of meritocracy a little bit more and like stop that just really think we need to stop deluding ourselves that every\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr what have you and all these encountering individuals who have no knowledge of ...\nAnd especially their students I get so excited about it because I feel like we have a wealth of opportunity and resources for students we have a conference on National Conference every year that brings about four thousand individuals half of those are undergraduate and graduate students\nAnd we give them an opportunity to present their research and for most of these young people this is the first time that they presented research\nThey can find a first internship they can find a job opportunity and they can find graduate school\nWhat about the ... for example high tech industry representatives at the conference is do you do that\nUm we are slowly moving in that direction I mean it's really hard to articulate too you know other big\nTech companies about what we do and what we have to offer it takes an inability to really take a look at your organization and what is the commitment to diversity and how does that trickle down to recruitment in hiring practices\nSo why not partner with nonprofits like soccer in us and other organizations that can help bring the talent to you that one viable strategy that we're still trying to break into if you will\nAntonio if you talk about conferences that ... has but on the other hand if I were studying geology I might go to the American geophysical union conference I mean there are plenty of conferences about science so you know why should I go to this one\nSo when you look at science we're the largest science diversity organization that is multicultural if you look at our participation we reflect a nation's demographics first of all so when you come to ... and when you come to a conference and your toying around you know I mentioned\nThis helps them to launch into their own scientific societies where they're not going to see the diversity\nDo you have any examples of that have you ever heard any stories where people said you know suddenly realize that this was a job that was it was open to use any one\nWell I Do have an example and it's a much older you know it was a college student but there was a college student who started with sucking us in the nineties and she was just had completed her bachelor's degree and was participating in a conference and in that process she met one of our founders\nAnd do that conversation the founder had shared with her and she's female as well really strong female accomplished scientists and talked about her experience in research and her experience in academia and what have you and that student had such a positive experience with the mentor who was the founder\nShe pursued she had to pass away it was recognizable to her because she was not only sitting next to someone that looked like her and could understand her but who was also identifying how to get there\nWhat's even more mind blowing is to hear about professionals who have been in whether it's academia and their profession for Twenty years\nThey come to our conference and they say for the first time\nThey see a sea of color and that they feel that they are connected and that their home it's something that they don't get in their own scientific societies\nMaybe you could tell me the story of how ... got started because you say it's been around for forty years of such a fairly long long time what was the dealer\nEssentially in the seventies there were a group of scientists that went to a triple A.

USC there has not been\nA USC quarterback to be very successful in the NFL the last\nSomewhat successful successful quarterback\nThat came out of USC is Carson Palmer okay ... okay career just retired after the end of last year and um now I honestly\nLike right from the moment I saw Sam during his senior year I knew that he was not going to be\nA franchise quarterback in my opinion um of course he was the big hype coming into the draft yeah everyone high on them should have been drafted first overall by the browns in some cases in some people's cases um\nBut I just I just haven't been impressed at all the season apps I haven't been oppressed whatsoever I'm the first game first pass interception after that ... salt game wasn't too bad um\nBut then after that just completely went downhill\nThe dolphins Seventy one percent completion its average it's average three hundred and thirty four yards a touchdown but two interceptions shoe interceptions is not going to win you a football game and\nDidn't win in ... so long and seeing it seems I don't even know the exact amount of days off the top of my head but let's just look at stuff that he had that game forty eight percent completion rate forty eight\nThis is the browns okay not of course they got then the war really ah they've been ... they have been high on him throughout the entire year a hundred and sixty nine yards zero touchdowns and two interceptions\nAnother two interceptions how can you possibly win a game when you throw two interceptions it's inferior eight I was watching the game I saw nothing ... nothing but bad bad stuff from them\nAnd then last week the jaguars fifty percent completion a hundred and sixty seven yards one touchdown did have an interception but still a tough jags team I'm not going to are not going to argue with that but fifty percent completion\nFifty percent completion once you get a stat that you're not going to win as a quarterback\nNow they're run game has been solid job as a crow al and their defense has been it's been okay there are differences been quite average\nBut just overall looking at us that this year only fifty seven completion\nEight hundred sixty Yard's not too bad not terrible he had a big first two games of the season after that kind of fell off the face of the earth but for touchdowns and five interceptions now as a jets fan I Know exactly how it feels\nTo know that you're a quarterback is going to throw the other team we dealt with\nMark Sanchez the buck fumble\nWe'd jet dealt with Gina ... Smith\nNow I don't know if the quarterbacks are just colorblind or what and can't see what color dirt dirt wearing that day but they have just looked\nThe throws are just absolutely terrible and I just don't see it now he had the most turnovers in college football last year\nAnd he's a turnover machine I haven't been impressed with him whatsoever the only game I've been impressed with them was the Penn State ... the Penn State Rose Bowl game\nYou had a solid game then and then completely just dropped off the face of the earth after that it seems\nAnd people are calling them the ... next best thing\nI I just I just don't see I haven't been oppressed whatsoever with him throughout his senior year and throughout his first four games as even in the pre season even in the pre season I wasn't impressed whatsoever I thought they should start McCown for at least the first half of season\nGive the kid you know some time to develop but no you're thrown right into the fire just like they did with Mark Sanchez and look what it's turned out to be a one of three start with for touchdowns in five interceptions\nIt just it makes me mad every time I watch the jets game and um\nYeah I I don't know when I'm at but that that's going to be my rent for the uh\nFirst segment that perfect you have like six seconds left actually and but I Want to do something I just want to show our viewers are nice little alert system\nHow neat with that but yeah that's how we're gonna control time but yeah All right good topics definitely for sure I agree with you on a lot of those points to have to just oh my God you know that France has soared around the corner as a fan of a team and the team that struggle with quarterbacks\nAnd within the last Twenty years you got Vinnie testing dirty but he was at the end of his career about that point but Chad Pennington he had a ... magic\nOne one of the magic wasn't okay one one I thought he's always been fits magic everyone's been right on that train all the way of arrive in Tampa Bay way by by the way I feel the need to add that real quick at the end of this ran a who who sits magical would run out like two weeks ago and every once and I was crazy\nHuh feel like I said that but not not you guys just everyone around the studio was like this magic he's ... he's not even starting this week just saw that in there\nEven though James Watson is not doing any better and he's starting his place I don't okay that's not my raptor [noise] yeah that's a that's that was in Iran Iraq something completely\n... but different um my ... minutes starts now let me on bell sir I have a few problems with you\nWhy you are probably your the star running back for ... all of the biggest franchises NFL history and yet you're the most greedy and self centered person ever\nI mean last week I think we did wonders we complained about how he wouldn't accept anything from the Steelers and that we think he's a big a big loss to say the least and then he says he's going to return on week seven guys we did we started a movement we started levy on bell you know the day's coming back but\nThe thing is that really gets me is that the other one is welcoming him with open arms even though they were the ones bashing him in the pre season hating him through all that and they were like oh and they were celebrating with corner and the browns game okay they need to pick their side because this is stupid I don't like\nI I don't like how bell can go from trashing Steelers to saying well I'm Sorry I'm coming back and you know here's this here's the thing the Steelers offered bell a three year forty seven million ... million dollar contract\nHe turn that down\nAnd so now what's he doing he's holding out for all these games losing money day by day when he could be making bank and probably adding to his his ACL each category with the Steelers ... know here they're very self centered person and for him to come back and weeks seven or so he claims\nAnd I don't know whether he's following ... advice by you know faking ... injury on the first play when it comes back it's the Steelers aside to play um\nWhich obviously I feel like they will because they haven't really produce much on off ants\nUm if he falls James Harrison device he's actually chicken I'm saying that right now if you put money before the sport you train your entire life for\nThen you're obviously brainwashed by your own personal greed and\nBell coming back and week seven\nIt's actually gonna know anymore and I don't I really don't wanna watch that game because\nIf everyone ... James Garner like he was nothing to the team than that I wouldn't want ... counter to be like I'm gonna get up and leave because ... has been through so much and he's been putting his\nHis asking the line for the team for so long and\nAll of a sudden he's gonna get out ... by someone who's just a big money ... a he's a cash cow he just wants the money he he doesn't even care about playing he's wants the money and the fact that he held true was word on holding out for so long because of your won't pay him\nIt's annoying you know we look at all this and he's trying to find different ways to beat the system and try to get a new a new contract no one got no one's going to want to give it and Jeff said that a few weeks ago how if\nIf they wanted the trade bell\nThey should have done in a long time ago because not only it's his fantasy stuck down his overall stock is down because he's waited so long he he's not in good shape he's been out partying\nHere I thought that was a big pickup I I honestly thought he was best ... second best player in the draft behind sequel on 'em but and that it takes time to develop it takes time to develop even as an officer Lyman um\nBut that that's about the only thing I can think of that they really have gone out there and try to help Andrew Luck I'm\nAn overall they're often says shifts\nDeplorable deplorable I I yeah no there's no other way where they're just rather a ways away scribe it I'm Jake did you have anything to add to last night's game it was just typical\nIt was normally how we see a New England go they go up by a lot then they will they relax a little bit what they'll posing team come back and in the fourth quarter they bring pressure and stop 'em it's typical it's what you see in every patriots game I don't know it's the same old same old for me\nWell and I think I think people can everyone was overlooking the patriots pour start\nGuys just what I think Julian Edelman back\nGuess what Jeff Gordon is now playing there they're going to get back and according to pretty well he had a great ... I think that's a great song start for him with the patriots now\nHopefully I wished nothing for the best for him I mean honestly I I think as a football player he's an amazing player when he is in the right mindset and hopefully the ... maybe being on a winning team all help that and help them fix those problems but I think the patriots are on the right track again\nUm they showed a graphic I I've very very much telling of how the patriots play yesterday they showed all their ... every year that they won the Superbowl and they showed what their record was through the first four games and two or three times they were too and to\nJust start off the air so much thought let's pump the brakes on New England being old and you know and one is ready to hit the cliff like that yeah on keeps talking about that every every one's been saying that last seven years I'm really happy you're brought up the record thing because this is off topic but\nFor now and every single year they've gone undefeated within the first five weeks they lost first games in the playoffs they haven't produced in the playoffs so they're all behind them saying oh this is our year okay look the history it's since back in Nineteen Ninety three where they start off undefeated and then they don't produce in in the playoffs\nAnd I have a rough game this week to their their at home but they have to play the Jacksonville Jaguars and they've been asleep or team all season I don't think I I wouldn't consider them as the preteen\nI consider them just because of ... a lot now under eights him a lot of people under ... honestly I'm not saying that the I don't think they're I don't think they are underrated I actually think they're one of the better but I'm saying by the general population they all a lot of them\nSay you're shaking your head I don't know I I I Can't say any team that ... that went to the AFC Championship game the year before is not asleep or to eat okay they went to pick you realize why they want the championship game right\nTo the Steelers absolutely sucked that game they were not protect so you're saying that the reason why they made it to that game is because the Steelers sucked in as the reason yeah well not the only reason but it was a main the main player and that now plague portals hadn't a fantastic game and that game and\nObviously the jaguars are not\nThey weren't secret team last year\nThey weren't ... they have a great young defense great young often\nI mean they're they're just overall they you can't sleep on you can't sleep on just flat out All right\nWhen it comes to the jaguars I'm ... I'm Sorry you can't just blame the Steelers for that I was just no way in the ceiling you but I Know so many Steelers fans I always say all was our fault like we just we messed it up for this sometimes you have to take into account\nTeam which is better than a better day\nI've seen a lot of improvement from Blake poodles a season and I hate to say 'cause I was not sold on him I mean I'm Still not but with the exception of a very poor we week or two against the titans with zero touchdowns and keep your reading of Seventy two and a half\nHe looked really good the season eastern for over three hundred yards and two of his games I mean he looks great and averaging acutely our score of Ninety four and seven touchdowns on the season I mean\nHe's he's doing a lot better for him I mean I think it's about proficient average maybe a little bit above middle of the quarterback right there I mean but if when you have a great defense that has great players like ... Ramsey collapse gambling all those that are that great defense you don't need\nTo have this you know stellar amazing ... and plus you got Leonard for not coming back eventually so people are forgetting about that too learned from that was a force on that office last year I mean he is probably one of the best running backs and this lady right now\nI'll be ... I wasn't a very high on Leonard for not coming into the NFL I thought he was going to be a Eddie Lacey type running back because he has that size and you don't really see a lot of power backs are in the league you see a lot of you know\n... threat backs and a lot of feedback and he's really developed I think senator you've got to the NFL into that ... threat back and I think he's done a ... a solid job since being drafted um but\nI guess we'll do picks will do picks on Jacksonville and Kansas City\nJake Kansas City by field goal or is it that it's at arrowhead we're going to go Jacksonville\nNot not not this fight but simply because I think eventually that you have to lose and [noise]\nAnd they collapse I mean look at the Panthers a few years back that they went\nAt fourteen games without losing and eventually you just you lose 'cause there's more and more pressure put on your shoulders and team that like you you're expected to produce at a certain level and just when you're gonna up against a great defense like the jaguars I mean if there's anything that can do it they would definitely be one of them in my opinion\nYou know this is arguably the toughest defense I still play all year they played Denver San Francisco Pittsburgh and Los Angeles\nUh the chargers and army much of a defense yeah exactly so I'm I'm going to go to the jaguars or I I think that it's their time to shine honestly I think that the jaguars I I Do like like for us I think he's\nI think he's a saw a solid\nQuarterback for the for the er jaguars I've changed my pick because I just remembered something Kent city almost lost to Denver last week in Denver as a young team I I I don't know I think they are you now see what you guys are saying you're coming down finally so I I Will change my pick\nA I'm going to go to Jacksonville alright\nWell not only that people will say well Patrick ... I'm not denying I think Patrick ... homes right now is a top five quarterback in the NFL right now right now right now right now I mean doesn't mean he's going to say that way but when you look at a team and is not just a quarterback yes in the game of football the quarterback ... probably as the most control of the sway of the game\nBy I'm Sorry he's going up against that great defense and\nWe're going to see who owns really is I think this week I think we're going to see if he's going to be that started the quarterback or if he's going to be you know just just your average typical quarterback but so far this year he has been that dominant quarterback\nI think I I think he's more than average 'cause I think that can just be showcased in his raw talent but that doesn't mean cause people forget he is he still has to develop that knowledge of the game and get that experience but as far as raw talent goes I haven't seen a quarterback with this much talent\nPlay last week I mean that was ridiculous you just switched arm like that because the news media and chase down I mean\nYou don't teach stuff like that that is just raw God given talent and I mean it doesn't mean he's going to be great for ever produced at this level forever it just I think he is definitely above average and will continue to be that way specially when you have the threats and Travis Kelsey tie retail\nAnd create going I think the weapons really make them when you are able to just bomb a down the hill he'll he'll can run fifty yards no problem I think that's been a real key weapon and then you have traveled coffee or\nA ... he's he's at above average tried and I ... I don't mean to the top five I think it's top five ... ... and just Sonia weapons around them Karim ... is just a force to reckon with yeah I'm Samy walking yeah having a a fantastic here I think um since\nUh the probably as best year since he's been with buffalo honestly um but yeah so um\nWe talked a lot about Pittsburgh already are but they are playing Atlanta this week so you're takes on\nThe game just to get out of this one [noise]\nHonestly I don't know anymore\nAnd I'm not saying not just because they don't want to what I thought what happened this week as we play the ravens and we've come close and I thought I thought we'd come back I didn't see it\nWe looked so ... on our team there was no fight we didn't show anything and that's the ravens that's our rival team that we're supposed to be on par with and struggled to for position and our division every year I didn't see any fight\nI ever wants to concern with the off the field garbage we just had camera neighbor speak out just I think today or yesterday about how the defense needs to get on the same age needs to go out there and play and believe in it all the players are too concerned with\nUh Atlanta I think wasn't or are they\nGame against okay so they had the Washington Nationals which I was at home so they had to travel from Colorado to LA to Chicago and then\nTo Milwaukee Milwaukee no none of these were at home except the national game but the tie breaker was at Los Angeles yeah the ... in Chicago and now they're at Milwaukee then the next game they should play is that Colorado in that\nI think that's when we start to see the Colorado Rockies finally bounce back from all of this jet lag they've been going through and put up some substantial numbers and I said it in my article on the pen and I'm only ... Emily marathon dot com\nThe Rockies are going to get past this team they're going to make some extra knocking to go past the next round but they're gonna make for the next round by some sort of thing that gets\nYou had the brewers have yellowish who has been an absolute bargain form this season he's been absolutely fantastic I think um but like you said the Rockies bullpen they're struggling out there they have hit that they've gone through their entire bullpen and at this point\nThings out amount of you know they look at him as the late ... guy you know the guy who can get the job done he almost blew the lead to the cubs in the wild card game ... ... you can't throw that when you're in the the dependent depending factor for your team you can't just\nYou can almost let them down and get everyone hopes have you just don't do that and\nThe yeah the Rockies does need to work on their bullpen and honestly I think their starting pitching\nI think they're starting to just fantastic I think the reason why I like the brewers and the season is because of people like yellow she as you've adding he bad at three twenty six thirty six homeruns and one hundred and ten RBI with all ... based percentage of four oh too that didn't see\nIt if I'm going to decide who the MVP is I'm going to go ... I wouldn't go\nI think he has been an absolute started a coming from Miami a and\nMiami ... really didn't get an insane amount for them and to put out\nThese kinds of numbers will have to see as years go on of course this is just one season you know it's not it's not jump on the or seen a lot of players who always have a great season and then they go downhill\nGo downhill um but I think I think personality is here to stay I really think he is I think a new Environment Forum was the big thing um Miami was a very they weren't the best team at all and\nThey were they were rebuilding for years and years and years and terrible say\nBut since uh\nFernandez passed away and it really hasn't been the same team\nWhich are beyond search eater there isn't a terrible job man all member he treated all their top players within like what the first week yeah it was like Donald Trump the sunny ... executive orders in his first week his presidency\nGranted so much going on and yeah give up the coast and I understand why they would give up John Carlos than cook a lot more in return ... absolutely especially with that strong Yankees organization which brings us to the game the game of the day\nThe game in a day that's happening start time is seven thirty to we've got New York who travels to Boston\nNew York fans have been wanting the series since two thousand and for the last time they play each other in the playoffs they were fighting it was it was it was a it was more than baseball it was\nRuthless aggression you think are rivals you think you think are you hearing slippery rock arrivals you have not seen New York and Boston the Yankees and the red Sox play at each other as a bloodbath oh not even that it's just a lot of good stories all together was it Curt Schilling back into seven he ... he saw the other buddies saw\nThe play is either hit them the Yankees but the Boston right\nSac all those guys played because that was the heat of the moment that was the ... yes ... throwing done Don Zimmer valleys and everyone blames paid for doing that okay look as ever took a swing Adam\nOkay that was retaliation but I'm\nFantastic match up as well we got a ... half against Chris outcry sale known for blowing it in the playoffs or Jay ... is very experienced\nI around thirty seven thirty eight right now um but I think it's salt match up uh it's gonna be at Boston as well so that is going to be a very hostile crowd for the Yankees play and as I think the Yankees are still very young team they still got judge shoes in my opinion still developing\nA solid player in his own right you got ... uh John Carlos than meal and do her and her\nHow 'bout loop voice Lucas voice the as I put a coat hero for the Yankees they're still the rookie first baseman no one really thought he would come out of the season and put up some big numbers he has been one of the most productive forces on the Yankees off the side and just ... and on the defensive side he keeps them all in front of him no he barely anything\nGo by um I really think people\nDon't give him too much credit because they use the ... names like John Carlos Stanton I'm Aaron Aaron Judge ...\nGary you mean how do you think air your Gabby Gabby\nGabby ... very heritable firms they are very Gary sense yeah Garry fishes\nBut like ... or he's going to be one of those\nPeople that\nI think they're going to be here for a while and Yankees be stupid to give them up honestly yeah\nI remember since I live or where there are ... the Yankees AAA team is a very rare writers are ... I'm Sorry\nThe on that team and I saw judge play I saw Sanchez play interplay and you knew just watching them that these guys are ... I mean I I look at judge and judges six seven and he just looks like a freak of nature\nStay of just looking at him his his biceps are probably just even as far as they're probably by the size of my thigh that's how big they are they're just ... it's just in human\n[laughter] so you can and Jeff is is human error judges\nJust I don't even know how to describe he's just a freak of nature um but I I don't know who you who you guys have in the series but I I have to say I like Boston\nPersonally I like Boston I just think that they have all my ...\nSee it's just looking at two teams are the most evenly matched teams and I I don't know they're just\nUp and down the line up there I think they are the two best teams in baseball I think\nYeah I think Boston as your courage ... or the upper hand I don't know I'm living living train of thought there I really think they're gonna take the serious gone the shape of serious and [noise] ... the way it's playing out Houston is going to overtake Boston for World Series or dance or World Series repeat\nAll right a sense for running low on time or just going to decide or on the Atlanta Los Angeles he's gonna win serious\nAtlanta\nI think LA um but\nThat ... will be taught how to not only that exciting yeah we'll be talking about playoff baseball for ah the entire month of October or Jeff I see you are holding up a picture on your laptop what'd you have for\nUs All right so in the news of the NBA preseason obviously got a lot going on a lot of great games with a bunch of young guys out there\nQuote if you guys will have me back I plan on resigning your next summer words of Kyrie Irving towards the Boston Celtics well [noise] or goes any of my hopes are free agency the season because I Do not foresee Kevin Durant coming to the next in the future and a\n... I'm I'm just saddened by the whole thing I think it makes sense Kerry has to do what's best for him because Boston obviously has the best chance at winning right now I mean a power as nice when you've got young players like Tatum and Jay Lynn brown and a bunch of those guys and you got 'em veterans in Hartford in a more is but\nI'm just personally sat in my um especially as the next ... he couldn't go anywhere worse than Boston I'm so as far as the NBA right now um things are looking good breezes especially the Lakers I Am very\nVery [laughter] very promising what they're showing the season ... definitely showed out in\nThe last game um anger him drop thirty one on the ... which is just\nSomething else to me and rockets may I also add Carmelo Anthony and see three their connection is looking very solid I'm very\nVery promising to see what's coming from the future for them because I criminal Anthony hasn't had a real point guard since Jason Kidd and I'm very curious to see how he produces when you have a guy whose main ability is his passing and for general ability of crystal I'm In my opinion the best point guard in the NBA a lot of people would disagree with me but\nVery\nThey\n[noise]\nThe one on\nIn the\nAnd the\nA new\nAnd they\nIt on the line I don't\nLa\n\n\n... and ... and ... and ... and he\nWill be will be many many people yet my God\nYou\nKnow when you show\nShift a shift a shift fish fish\nAnd game and fish and\nYou see the world\n\nI mean [noise]\n[noise] she she she she [laughter]\n\n[noise] [laughter]\n\nYeah I'm a nurse and she\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise] she sheesh\n\n\n\nAnd he sees [laughter]\n\nThe ... been\nOrange trees in way\nI'm\nI'm\nGoing to talk about lower bird dog and a dog\nThe doors there we go there and\nLater I'll read anything that I\nKnow maybe they\nTime\nMe a new thing that\nLeast so many of these pain\nThe blood and the Los Angeles\nNa\nNa na\n\nNa na\nNa na na na\nNa na na ...\nThose are your garner yeah [noise] yeah well I'm a\nYou know\nWhere to go to\nJerry na\nNa na na na she did a\nUm\n[noise]\nWhich are [noise]\n\n[laughter]\n\n[noise]\n[laughter] ...
