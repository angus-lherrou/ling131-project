I'm Molly badly welcome to the big picture science produced at the SETI Institute\nFear them are annoyed by them use them and sometimes eat them but how well do we really know animals our views of them are often simplistic the appealing panda the cuddly kitten but also the lazy slot or the dirty rat\nSo we may not fully appreciate how extraordinary animals are and it's a case of positive feedback or aversion to some animals keeps us from getting to know them better in this episode research that corrects a menagerie of misunderstandings about our fellow for feathered and scaly friends\nThe co director of the recent documentary rodents of unusual size and how termites might just help save the planet but before any of that we might just have to get over ourselves first\nIt's creature discomfort\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\n\nDogs cats my breath for years that look in the quantum rats chimpanzees antelope sharks spiders toads I mean they're all animals\nWe conveniently forget that humans are in that list too we are also animals however we observe the amusing the terrifying the occasionally odd behavior of other creatures\nAs if they inhabit a biosphere that is separate from our civilized own\nAs a result some of our observations about animals how ever well intentioned a superficial and then you don't have to be clever as a Fox to recite a few popular tropes like quiet as a mouse dumb as an ox and that sneaky result\nRight that's right if I had an elephant memory I could do better than say blood\nAnimals based on their appearance or some aspect of their\nBehavior and as humans who conveniently forget their animals we want to be accepted and appreciated for who we really are this means taking time to understand the context of what seems like bizarre behavior for example let's say we hear a guy screen\nIs you're freaking very strongly sandwich and then he throws a deli sandwich at someone for health too casual observer that guy's nuts but then you find out that he works for ... deli thanks for choosing Reagan\nFor all you do indeed\nWhen it comes to other animals we don't always take the time to understand the context of their behavior or the behavior itself it's easier to go with our quick impressions says zoologist loosely cook and that's not because we don't love our furry and feathered pals it's that we look at them through a human centric lens\nThings change when we consider animals in the context of their own existence\nThe truth about animals is Lucy cook's book stones lost love Lauren ... and other tales from the wild side of wildlife although she admits that some animals do seem to go out of their way to put us off\nConsider the thermal regulation habits of the vulture an animal already at a disadvantage some would say for it's less than appealing beak and physique\n[laughter] who is the phone she's all wonderful extraordinary peaceful fantastic creatures they are much maligned because of that Robin unsavory habits one of which is dining on the dead\nI'm which has won them few favors particularly given the fact that they look like the grim reaper themselves hasn't really help but they have another round of unsavory habit up that are um slave I said well what she's um you're a high ... which is basically\nOne of the issues you have is an animal is trying to keep your temperature down so well they do is they will definitely Kate on their legs and that's a very liquid form of death vacation\nAnd so that will then evaporates and well actually cool but man the same way to sweat would do for us it's just you know perhaps even more unseemly and sweaty um pets\nAll right so the way it keeps his cool is the same way that will as you say sweating or or ... Brits things some water on your face it's the evaporation that goals him down precisely you make the case in your book that we have biases against some animals because we misunderstand them\nBut I understand what you describe perfectly understand why we have an aversion to vultures given this kind of hygiene habits because you know if humans did this or the cocktail party a that would be considered a real social blunder whereas the animals seem to be able to get away with it they don't offend other animals or other vultures in this case\nAbsolutely not know that that just getting by surviving the best way that they can and I mean you know I I sort of a pulled them for their ingenuity I think evolution has done a splendid job and the case of the vote ...\nAnd you know vote just as I say the much maligned people don't like them they ... they eat dead things and it's natural off stomach would be fun because obviously if we were to dine on caucuses\nWe'd be very very ill ourselves so that revulsion that we feel about ... natural unfortunately ... that translates into is that we\nCertainly with animals like vote ... we find on appealing we don't tend to want to put as much money into trying to conserve them and in the case of the phone and that's a very big mistake indeed because ... shows off base any forensic\nCleanup units with that it's infected faith in that who bring up caucuses are filled with bacteria they doing\nHuge dramatic decline of votes numbers in India by as much as Ninety nine percent in some cases estimates it costs the government billions of dollars because of this subsequent rising stray dogs and rabies as a result of the last ... just doing that cleanup job so\nWe can be very um judgmental about what we like what we can see those judgments are emotionally based and not always you know necessary the wisest\nWhy is that what's driving our misunderstanding of animals is is there is some common denominator in that\nSo there's there's various different types of mistake we might but the first and foremost thing that we sort of compelled to do it seems that the species is to look for our reflection in the animal kingdom so\nI think you know as a species that were quite insecure and we're constantly looking for reflection in the animal kingdom and it's not always appropriate just because something looks like our behavior or looks familiar to us does it mean to say that that animals are behaving like us a tool you know a classic would be\nThere was a show the other day they went completely viral of two penguins and they look like that flip the switch touching and and everything oh look how cute these penguins or so in love\nYou know they once they were just walking out of the city at the same time that slip is just managed to touch but we all ... to ... about animals and that has got us into a lot of trouble and continues to I think\nWe all think the penguins are are really cute\nAnd that is because they will cut right so they're like little humans and then they won't be around\nBecause they like salt really engineered for use online that brilliant unable to work as a rather but they really worked very well lines they stumble around helplessly and that triggers are innate need to know just so you know that's very hard wide enough so so we we are compelled to love penguins and we think the best of them\nRodents of unusual size\nAs the film describes there's more to the store\nThirties to supply the for industry\nBut then like the fictional hormone disrupted sleep is they escaped now twenty million nutrient which is more than four times the human population of Louisiana are swimming scurrying and eating the way to the fragile coastal wetland so the Mississippi Delta\nAnd there are a problem not just in the pelican state but also Oregon Washington in Maryland\nAnd didn't like the killer bunnies inside by they're being hunted but unlike the night of the leap is the stakes are very real involving the livelihood of Louisiana and the health of the disappearing wetlands and the killing of millions of animals that arrived by no choice of their own\nI wanted to go to the craziest into [noise]\nBack in the Nineteen thirties [noise]\nDuring the great depression [noise]\nAnd a few folks do you are you making any\nSteady in Britain baskets\nDecided to do every one of\nThe sort of reading these exotic twenty pounds wrote that have been brought all the way from Argentina up here to Louisiana [noise]\nYounger than me twenty pounds [noise] these things\nIt animal came out in Nineteen fifty eight like an invasion autograph that the ... the clean like a baseball field now it's all water [noise]\nIf they don't go deep at all I Want to hit to the dishwasher that away they've raised so much every three months she's having a little\nAll my family is from over here\nBut if the lands on then [noise] me and my family don't have a few [noise] so if I help wipe out the neutral and that set up for me and medical generations from now [noise]\nThat's why we went out on the body has to do that\n[noise] I'll tell you that some of the things that are very distinct about nutrients there rat front legs but then they have ... ... feet so like they're like a duck\nThey don't smell so good and they smell like a ... dog they do make some unusual noises it goes but they very kind of nervous about humans and so while there are a lot of them and their invasive to Louisiana they'll kind of scatter off when you get nearby\nMy goodness I write a nutrient is a rodent right so what are its closest relatives I mean it's also known as a swamp rat so I presume it's related to rats or tell me about you know closely related critters so new\nTree or rodents they're closer to things like copy bears and beavers than the kind of normal rats that we think about a lot of people confused ... bars in nutrients ... bars are the largest rodent in the world but they are much cuter in coffee bars actually have kind of for regular legs where as nutrient looks more like a rat\nThey're semi aquatic animals there are ... in the sense that they only vegetation particularly roots\nMost new tree or maybe about Fifteen to twenty pounds but one of the big problems that they have to be an invasive species that the breed really quickly so like within three months four months you know baby can start reproducing and they have litters of six to eight babies and so you can imagine that they're more prolific than rabbits\nAnd what about their teeth I read that they have read the kind of reminds me of a I don't know a vampire\nMe [laughter] [noise] well while we consider nutri kinda cute once you get up close and personal from far away they kind of have this kind of horror movie look in the sense that they're you know like the super size giant rat but they do have these giant front orange teeth\nThe teeth or orange because they feast on routes and the roots are rich and iron and so the iron basically manifests themselves an orange teeth that you see some people are actually making jewelry out of them in Louisiana\nOkay so ...\nYou said twenty pounds that's pretty heavy yeah pretty big and they can get up to thirty or thirty five pounds but most of about twenty okay that's how we are the most of the squirrels in my backyard are now in your movie new to show up in Louisiana swamps also\nIn urban canals on golf courses just how invasive are these creatures and how are they destructive I mean what do they eat that makes them so destructive\nNutri are brought to the United states or its Pacific leave Louisiana in the Nineteen thirties to\nBasically help with the for industry of the thought was was that a lot of people harvested ... and new tree or four or five times or ... Malik well\nThis is just a lot more effort so they started these for farms during the great depression and of course like a lot of great human ideas they didn't think about the consequences in the new shirt either quickly escaped or let loose end of the swamps that wasn't a problem at first because they just kind of late in weight\nAnd they reproduce and reproduced and they quickly took over the area and a displaced the mosque rat and so from the Nineteen fifties the Nineteen seventies many Louisiana's harvested wild nutrient for her\nBut of course once for became less invoke there was no incentive to wind up harvesting the for and they basically sat in the swamp multiplied and multiplied until the late Nineteen nineties when they are about twenty or twenty five million new tree\nAnd the reason why nutrient problem Louisiana's that their um vegetarians they like to eat the roots of the plants in the wetlands to keep the soil together this soil in the wetlands help protect Louisiana from storm surge and hurricanes in when you lose that soil inland it doesn't come back and so there are many acres of\nLand there last each year to erosion that's accelerated by the nutrients\nAre these guys are brought up from South America but it turns out that there are good match to the environment of southern Louisiana\n[noise] no natural predators and Louisiana steps human beings and Louisiana's just natural climate works out very well for the nutrient Argentina and South America where the nutrient urgently brought from don't have these problems because the natural cycles of the seasons keeps them in check and then also some of the predators\nMany people ask why don't alligators in Louisiana eat them and like\nAlligators eaten nutrient the problem is is that once they won nutrient that's a pretty good meal for them for a week or two and so there's so many new tree of that it's impossible for the alligators in check and heck it's hard enough for the humans to keep them in check\nAll right well I mean keeping them in check that presumes there's a problem and you can't it at a major environmental problem in the Mississippi Delta it tell me how severe this problem is I mean is it something that if I were living there I Would notice\nSo if you lived in Louisiana are particularly southern Louisiana you've seen the nutrients and you've probably seen a very up close and personal you probably haven't eaten in Korea just given the way that things were there\nWith that said during the eighties and nineties nobody was out there hunting and harvesting nutrients in the late Nineteen nineties the state realize that they had a problem millions of a giant rodents that we're eating up the wetlands and this was causing increasing damaged from hurricanes and other storms\nSo they needed to figure out a way to incentivize people to go out and hunting trap these animals like it's been done in the past and so they came up with some different creative ideas one was maybe we could get encourage people to eat them maybe we could encourage the fashion industry to start using for again and then the more kind of recent and most successful program is a bounty program\nWhere they pay people five dollars a tale so for every new tree you kill you cut the tail off you bring it in and you turn it in\nAnd with some of the folks that we spent time with is that they might go out for half a day and catch anywhere between three hundred four hundred nutrients I can imagine doesn't pay too bad if you're a good shot\nAt it you know per hour depending on\nSkills to do it it works out very well I mean if you put me out there with a gun and give me all day I don't know if I could hit one new tree I even though there's so many of around you say there is a five dollar bounty for the tail why detail and what happens to the rest of the nutrient\nThat's always the conundrum with a killing the new tree innocence that they need to wipe out these animals because they're causing such havoc environmentally but there isn't real no market for their for right now and so the reason why the state pays for the tail is basically proof of life in the sense that you kill the nutrient you found it and\nThese animals are fairly large there twenty pounds so imagine if you killed three hundred and the day that's a lot of animals to bring in so what they do is they have rules and regulations that kind of ensure proper disposal and the swamps but it causes problems in the sense of you're throwing a lot of organic material into the waters at ... blooms et cetera and so\nThey're different kinds of independent minded people there and try and encourage people to bring the for an and figure out some kind of sustainable ways to create clothing that people might find it attractive\nAnd even recently there's a dog food company that's going to meet that they harvest I Wonder what the flavor will be described to be [laughter] I don't know their taste of the swamp [laughter]\nI mean I have to confess I've eaten nutri a couple of different ways so if you'd like to know how it tastes I'm I'm happy to share I Would like to know well as you can imagine in Louisiana there kind of legendary for their cooking and I can tell you\nBoy or girl young or old everybody knows how to cook in cooks really good so we've had it cooked in kind of an Asian stir fry by James Beard award winning\nChef students Spicer and that kind of tasted like pork tenderloin but we also had a jazz musician or current refunds barbecued up for it and I can tell you that that was just as good as pulled pork and so\nI often think it tastes a lot like different very ideas of pork um but it's a very lean meat so you don't have the kind of ... that you might have some pork okay well that would be the difference\nFor an environment so the termites that I watch for the longest time we're macro term is Madeleine says and they were in Namibia and they build with little balls of mud which they making their mouth and the mud is somewhat cemented with some kind of special termites saliva\nAnd we don't know exactly how they built but a basic description of it is that one tour might will put down one dirt ball and\nAnother term might will put down another dirt ball on top of that and then they keep piling up the dirt ball until they have like little peaks and then those little peaks kind of connect to make frilly little walls\nAnd then those walls some of them have arches in them they begin to build up and one of the things that we know drives them is the smell of fresh air inside their mound it smells really intensely of termites smells really intensely a fungus\nAnd of course there's all this feces and they're constantly transferring microbial\nSort of starter culture to each other\nBy mouth to mouth to mouth but [noise] so there's this intense smell in there and when any fresh air comes through some termites run from the fresh air into the mound and set off alarm a sort of us that they make a sound\nAnd then other termites grab a dirt ball they build and build until they've cut off the fresh air smell\nSo just to be clear the fresh air is not something they're drawn to the way that we are when we want to step out of our buildings and get some fresh air the fresh air suggests that there may be holes are vulnerabilities in their defense system\nYes if you're termite you're constantly being attacked by aunts and aunt eaters aren't barks an art wolves and anything else that can\nYou know how to patrol your parameter and the way that they do that is that when they smell fresh air they know they need to go do something\nWhat what is the reason for these complex structures though I mean they could probably just make a very simple mound maybe I I Would say maybe like an ... mountain but perhaps that's not simple either so I shouldn't say that\nThe lie so a lab or it almost like a like a palace and insects version of a beautiful palace\nWell it's always an interesting question of why something that's evolutionarily drive to like a bug\nIs building something so elaborate like amount or the particularly these a macro attorneys mountain Namibia I'm we know that the mound itself has several functions one of them is that it works kind of like a long it manages to both protect them from wind and cold\nYou know keeps moisture in it keeps too much rain out when it's really wet it makes the air fresh it also keeps too much fresh air from coming in and it also regulates the temperature\nI was going to have you describe the ways in which these structures inspire robot is is that your description that you just have suggested that they would also be of interest architects\nThere are of interest to both robotics this and architects [noise]\nUm and there are several architects around the world one in Zimbabwe won in England and another one in Australia that I Know of who have gone to turn my mounds\nAnd look for ways to use passive ventilation or passive cooling more efficient ways of cooling human structures [noise]\nUm but the robot is is a really studying what drives the termites\nAn dirt balls and the environment create a large amount I mean one of the huge mysteries of the mind is how do these little creatures\nWith only you know maybe two hundred thousand neurons each how did they build these huge complex structures without a master plan so\nThe assumption is is that they have sort of a term might rule book or what would we would call sort of an algorithm and that somehow they're following a set of rules which results in the building of a large amounts\nTo the ideas could you build maybe small autonomous robots put them in motion and they could build it on their own is that the idea\n[noise] absolutely so you could make autonomous construction robots that you could send to Mars or Afghanistan or the Fukushima nuclear plant and they could build and put in barriers or build a house I'm without\nAny kind of on the ground guidance from humans um and that eventually we would have our our homes built by you know robots instead of working people\nYou write that termites or the poster bugs for the twenty first century a little guide to big ideas isn't linking it to our technologies future an overreach\nI don't think so at all ah everything that termites do we want to do [noise]\nAnd while we have spent the last hundred years harnessing the big forces of nature\nWhat we want to do in the future is be much lighter on the earth much more like a termite um we want to have autonomous robots we want to be able to eat would the way they do I'm In a laboratory setting or in an industrial setting we want to be able to genetically alter microbes\nAnd have them have the microbes break them down and be able to create biofuels out of them\nUm and finally we want to be able to somehow harness the termites ability to keep especially the dry parts of the planet fertile even as the climate changes\nTermites or are fascinating in their own right um and as we adjust our attitude toward seeing them just as pass you remind us that only a few of them are actual test that the majority of termites are not considered pass isn't that right\nYes there's solid ecological citizens and you know they also Dr fertility in some other sketches areas on earth\nTo guess most termites or good some termites or about the termites that are bad tend to be the ones that really have adapted to humans or where humans are somehow encouraging them\nLand that has been disturbed is very attractive to certain kinds of termites and those are the pastor much\nOne of the earliest stories of termite migration is that when the Spanish ships went to Peru back in the uh fourteen and Fifteen hundreds they picked up a kind of dry wood termite that they've been carried around the world\nThe invasive termites that you find in the south east of the United states traveled over here on pallets of for munitions and and other things um right after World War two\nWe should get at the notion of what a pest is and even the idea that an insect or any kind of animal is bad because that's not a biological category\nIt's really kind of a human category it's something that we call animal\nFor my to our past are eating my house but it it causes us to kind of ignore all the other termites who are off you know doing good things\nWe look at a lot of animals do an anthropomorphic lens and we judge of their behavior by our our own standards but conversely even people who are trying to defend animals explain why they're important to us well draw on the argument of what they can do for us and I'm Wondering if identifying how animals can help us\nIf it has problems itself of it's kind of validation cop out\nWhy can't we just admire animals simply on their own terms see the world the way that they see it and not the ways in which they're useful to us\n... well this is a really interesting question so but it happens at all different levels I mean on the one hand you've got really highly trained robot is going out\nAnd staring into term like mountains for a month and\nUm they wouldn't be there if they hadn't been able to convince somebody to give them money\nAnd on the other hand uh one of these were bought us is designed to a tracker that allowed us for the first time to see termites as individuals to realize that they have memories to realize that there are turned my leaders in termites slackers and so you know there there's an interdependence between\nOur seeing certain animals as useful and our ability to kind of deploy\nScientists out to look at them\nIf we just said well termites or beautiful we could send poets to look at the ... mountains but they're going to come up with something different\nThan when you send a robot assist or geneticists to look at the turn my mom\nHas anyone ever written that you know of that you could quote from a poem about a term I\nI have no ... to ... I'm Sorry\nPaul I'm about termites certainly send it to us well will\nFinally Lisa I'm I understand that termites or the evolutionary cousins of cockroaches [noise] so does that mean that your sympathies and appreciation for the termites and the termites find qualities extend to its greasy shelled cousin the cockroach [noise]\n[noise] ah\n[noise] I\n\n\n\n\nYou are locked onto your alternative source Ninety point one W.

[noise]\nWelcome instead our friday edition of sports talk live Happy Friday everyone I'm stealing a drawing by Jake football Nick and Jeff art how we feel in\nDoing that\nIs fantastic so a liquid there last week we are going to continue the trend of doing a five minute rant a we describe what it was last week no one is allowed to talk during that time except the person that is ranting on our\nHandy dandy buzzer yeah handy dandy butter\nThough\nYeah so uh I don't know who wants to start out here first\nGood job you start alright whenever you're ready to\n\nStart All right so from Iran\nBeyond just\nWithin the rules organization right now you are listening to I've not heard situation going on in Minnesota right now just this week with the team for ... years and then we're hoping generals yeah not a concern\nHowever I disagree with that when you see the whole situation of how I just off the hall\nWith the ownership and management right now with the turtles live in a nation because after\nJimmy Butler beats the stars there was word that the sort of are laughing about the situation you just got humiliated by your search teams and you find that funny to me that shows a lack of commitment to success to the organization\nAnd do your fellow teammates around you and when you have problems like that going on in our success organization the rent Vince Lombardi once said individual commitment to a group effort natural needs to work and I really do not feel that they're committed to the scene there only committed to their\nOwn individual success I'm dismayed at the state\nOf the generals I feel bad for any timber wolves fan out there anyone in Minnesota I Would be a shame to be a fan this poor team right now you have to probe talented you we bonded with average twenty two points last year has been a leader on that team that minutes I have to work his whole career you had to be in Chicago with a great Derrick Rose and had to work as well\nStarted out as it offensive talent and now as a top Templar lead in my opinion may disagree but we're a Denver quite\nRequested a trade a couple of weeks ago a visor do who is the head coach and president cause December rolls\nAnd that hasn't quite happened yet because typical refuses to treat him\nI think it's ridiculous because what would have wanted a contract extension and and they gave it to Henry weekends who has been on the record by many female as being a player who cares about the money they gave him a hundred and forty eight million dollars I think about a hundred and forty million but they won't give it to Jimmy Butler you know the twenty two points became shore I mean\nI think that's the hundred inches Williams played was not developed since his rookie year here's an athletic talent I'll give them that but he hasn't really developed his game and the time and he's\nPlayed 'em on top of it\n[noise] were given that and they were\nSaying oh I Want to know how much they're um everybody to be that when\nYou are a generational talent like butler I think it's beyond ridiculous to be treated the way he has been treated I think as a team yet is your duty to treat the players with the respect they deserve Butler's done nothing but good for that team\n\n[laughter] I mean I just I Can't even begin to say how\nIt appalls me as an NBA fan here the treatment of a star ... light Jimmy Butler because of what he has done for that team and they've under achieved I think it's ridiculous because you guys like Carl Anthony towns in June and Andrew weekends laughing about it which clearly shows or commitment you were considered a contender team because you have\nAll star pros like ... pounds of Jimmy ... we were always the problem then you've got Andrew Lih into you know\nHas room to improve however you know what a decent player All right thank you are and you have other role players like Derrick Rose Jeff tea in other guys on the team who are good and I think you could compete in the west and they haven't done that so I think it is beyond ridiculous that that organization is treated in all started lecturing me about the way they have it's appalling I abhor everything that that\nGroup is done because\nIs your responsibility and duty to the players to make sure that you're committed to their happiness\nAnd if you have guys aren't committed that is going to be a problem for other players on the team who are hard workers like butler bottlers a different kind of guy in the NBA he had to work his game up from day one he was never considered the best and the team but he had to work his way there he just started out defensively and now he's an offensive threat as well\nSo as an NBA fan I'm appalled and discuss it and I I sincerely hope maybe the next ... you know what I mean they won't [noise] but [noise] I'm going to end on that note there\n[noise] okay so the government treating argument um I Do want to say I'm Sorry to all the listeners out there we got some out there we are experiencing some technical difficulties we got it all figured out\nJeff I'm you know I'm not really thinking about like professional basketball 'cause honestly I think it's just turn into the Torah Bronx show but um I agree that the next thing you need to make a move or like do or die or pretty much I'm On the other\nThing too is that the tumor was when they got Jimmy ... was supposed to be really one of the teams to be and now they have all this dysfunction and everything and it's really bringing the team that I think ah you have your three main guys are essentially fighting with each other and you never want that for a your team but\nIt's going to be a storyline to watch out for especially with Jimmy Butler his antics this week\nUm but yeah so so I guess you can go and all that sweet and time starts now [noise] first I\nWant to make a public service announcement blocks in our public service announcement up public police manning you need to retire\nSeriously you are your brain is not in the game\nYou are absolutely killing your team you guys are now at a one in five record all dude all because of your hands you had no touchdown passes last night I guess the eagles\nUm granted they are tough team you had twenty four forty three and completion versus attempts terrible you didn't break three hundred yards which is okay because you know some four bucks can't do that even the most starts at one time\nCarrie the entire team last night I don't understand it he had one hundred and thirty yards Thirteen carries one touched down absolutely decimate and the fantasy stock or fantasy column\nUm you're making all of your receivers and all kinds of wind turned on you because of how terrible your play calling is how you how you run your off since this are you one wants to rule congratulations that was eleven years ago get over it because\nNo matter what you need to change and whether that means you're retiring or not ... because so far if you stay the longer you stay in this league the longer you're wide receivers are not going to want to play for you and you're going to have more Adele back ... back in cases on your hands where they go into this go into the locker room\nWith time still on the clock at halftime just because they just they don't trust you you're losing your offensive\nOr your ... offensive player trust you can't let sake one Barclay\nAnd your defense carry the team for you granted I thought the eagles are going to put up a lot more points than they usually do they held him at least under two touchdowns per quarter and the for the only held him to a field goal however you can't rely on everyone else to do your dirty work for you you are the captain for the team for a reason\nUm you shouldn't have to use that to your advantage where I get you where you have to be lazy captain and say All right everyone else do the work I'm going to sit here for the ride and hopefully benefit off you guys again because that's how selfish I Am\nYou know you have the eagles who utilize anything they possibly can Carson once as an absolute juggernaut Wendell small would fill the void for I'm Jay a giant now that he's out for probably the season in my right you know that he's out for a long time is up for the season are a good one to small would you know only fifty one yard\n[laughter] fifty one years on Eighteen carried court comment forty three yards and eleven carries for one touched down and then you also have Zach or it's one of the best walking and receiving titans and the league um Nelson Aguilar who can\n[noise] then um we go over to Robertson who is from ... he's still rather young he's going to reach he's only Twenty one right now but he'll be twenty four when the next World Cup happens so just adds to the young defense\nThen you've got some experience you've got ... who has been a regular main stay in the United states national team or the very very quick\nA right wing or right back he's gonna be twenty eight\nSo we're looking at fairly fairly young defense but still at the same time very experienced defense they've been most of these players have been throughout the national team camp so I'm looking I'm looking at a success go for for them then\nWe move into the midfield we've got Julie ingrained who is\nLet's be honest it he's been a complete boss for the United states but it's starting to come around again\nA scored his first ever goal in the last World Cup in Brazil I think he was only Eighteen at the time Nineteen but ah one of the world cup comes around twenty seven so still young he's so I'm Still going to give them enough time to develop into maybe the star that he has meant to be\nBut then this is this is where I really I really love this team and I the reason why I think that are most promising team in the world we got McKinney who is from who plays for ... a ... place more of a center defensive midfielder he's only twenty\nThree she just scored his first ... his first goal first club\nIn the regular league play and also scored into champions like all the same week sober looking at success and him uh as long as he continues to dominate and worked his way up into\nHowever that we got Christian people sick the Hershey born\nNative and he has looked absolutely fantastic since joining doormen are still extremely young but he is probably the most promising United States national player\nEver\nI mean he's he's probably the most shorter thing that the United states has had in a long time\n\n[noise] and how are you [noise]\n\n[noise] yeah I didn't [laughter]\nCome with the motion overcome with emotion 'cause I [laughter] I think\nWhat we're bashing it here on the are identical to WIP sports or anything I can get to finish but I'm just name the last two Jeff sergeant who still young twenty two and George ... a similar way a son of former men's player of the year George way a\nPresident of a Liberia but uh yeah yeah yeah he's got to be twenty two so the average age that I predict that the United states will enter the next World Cup is going to be twenty five\nHard to believe are considering everything that's been going on but I think that the United states is the\nIs the best team going for cough what's so funny to me\nJust stop my conversation was boring because of soccer\nBut I Do not on on how to invest the empty me thank you that's not to use our fellows sailors\nI have some great news for a week six picks if we do NFL picks I have an ex ... oh okay wow\nI didn't like being in my computer literacy classes all over again with some renting\nAs are the people in the booth now um but yeah I I think that the United states I'm not going\nTo say that you're going to win the world cup of course this coming next cycle but as far as the following cycle that the games are going to be split between Mexico Canada and the U.S I think that they have a solid chance if the United states is not get to the quarter finals each of the next world cops that it will be a national tragedy\nFor the for any soccer fan in the United states I agree [noise] absolute tragic\nBut yeah [noise] um anyway that was my rent a great job every one I think that's right I'm Robert ... oh yeah I'm looking forward to next week's already I'm suppose knowing rented about R U P\nThan I Do that every day for that ... yeah I get that previous I Do that\nEvery day already anyway I can ... I don't ...\nI Need more than a show to rant about IU pie but the way I might the last two weeks from Sam so yeah I mean or commentary okay now we provide some ... we're going to pick up the best games that the NFL I'm starting with everyone's favorite team\nOr the Pittsburgh Steelers and the ...\nOh boy was perfect for friends this week right ooh hey let's try and\nMaine let's try and keep this under ten minutes this a little ... short\nAnd simple Cincinnati for the win just the parents are perfect perfect is coming back in any dolphins on fire and I know that's not a gender joke that is true he's been on fire right rifle red rifle [noise]\nSo I as a Steelers fan I think we'll do what the Steelers do best will put ourselves in a very interesting situation to where we'll do enough to where we are still in the playoffs talk but we need a lot of other people to screw up before we can get in the playoffs I think 'cause if you if you notice we play Cincinnati\nTo find our season if we do not go to in three or three answering these nice games we are not making the playoffs so what do you say I say my pick will be we will beat the Cincinnati Bengals okay they tie breaker\nI personally like Pittsburgh and this game or just because [noise] Cincinnati played well in the fourth quarter but didn't show up the first three quarters that's for sure\nUh Cincinnati is defenses okay I like the addition of perfect coming back if that's that's true I'm pretty sure you know somebody dies and hurting guys I mean yeah and if he is not spending yeah if he's knock any fines or this year so I don't get fined ...\nAnyway uh yeah but I I just like Pittsburgh they did a finally played\nAll three phases of the game last week\nI think we can blame part of that on the poor play of the falcons though I mean we've said that yeah we say OK I tried to ... I Try to give this drug dealers the bones but we'll see the thing that I'm I'm a I'm a realistic fan here I Will call I think is a fan you need to be able to call out your team and point out 'cause I Know some people that are delusional\nFor their teams that are like oh we're finally cowboys fans the most delusional fans in any sport any cowboys listeners out there don't care changed my mind do what you have them you will never change my mind is Steven\nCrocker All right I'm next another find it interesting game in Chicago at Miami\n[noise] I personally like the bears are no real reason but [noise] I don't know I just feel like Miami wait is it in Chicago or Miami it's in Miami who hard rock\nStadium [noise] beautiful stadium I ... I think ... ... ... I think he's\nDoing well I'm going in\n\nJordan hours that's right or the ... answer yet Mm\n... you're thinking of the [laughter] All right I'm even though I think it'll be a close game simply because it's in Miami and you have a cold weather team like the Chicago Bears however I think the bears will when\nI'm I think is mainly because it's predicated on their great defensive play this year they were already a top ten team last year in their defense and I think ... just elevated their play to the next level um\n[noise] the Miami Dolphins just having performed or the way I think they should not because Ryan tannahill isn't\nI mean there are only the twenty seventh and points right now which is quite sad honestly when you have players like democracy Parker Matt Ryan and a Kenyan Jake and you're not performing at the level that you should be at least offensively I could understand eventually taken a step back because you lost players like ... too\nBut I my ... disappointed me last lot sooner I mean I'll give them the patriots because they got Edelman backing combined with Josh Gordon I think the patriots are going to be quite the force the rest of the season but I'm going to go with Chicago\nOkay I'm\nThink I'm going to be a lone wolf here I'm going to go at Miami always got to go at Chicago venue to Chicago so I wanted on or off a little bit about my I mean I think things Miami's a solid team this year Tanenhaus looked\nHe's look better he uh after coming off injuries like there's no tomorrow last several years or ... facts or he is ... finally has come back and has done\nA pretty good job I led by amateur three no record of course they have been very successful as of late but I think that the last the bangles in the fourth quarter will really propelled them\nTo a victory can where else\nAre you looking at me like that Jeff I'm just curious to see how this matchup is going to turn up\nIt's going to be a good time if you're a neutral baseball fan it's gonna be a great great championship series absolutely you look at these but you have to you got to Los Angeles Dodgers against the Milwaukee Brewers\nThey're expected side of the field [noise] quite honestly I really think I I I doubt Los Angeles coming into this playoff bracket but have shown me something different um clerk or shall we all know is he was terrible when it came to postseason but\nHe has been putting on a clinic out there and the fact that he's going up against the brewers are that in the Dodgers have a chip on the shoulder they lost last year to the Astros honestly I think it's all going to plan out where the Astros and Dodgers rematch in the world series despite Red Sox are the red Sox goods or recent success\nIt's all going to end somewhere and unfortunately the Yankees can do it but I think we all knew that going into the to the uh\nDivisional series um but then again brewers they have a great offensive stack however I don't think yell at you'll be able to catch up to ... Clinton herself hook I really don't um so in my opinion I think\nLos Angeles are going to walk out of it it's going to be a tough contests obviously either too serious that can go game seven and no one would be surprised I think\nIt's going to end up like that game seven um that's where the scale as I said I made my production Houston is going to come out on top um you look at who ... it's just an overall pitching show in my opinion\nUm Saturday we got Justin ... versus Chris Sale Chris Sale not known again he's like ... not really known for his a post season stats but he defied the odds and even in a\n... even game too for that series is going to be a great match ... Cole the former Bach versus David Price\nNow this is something that I'm going to say this right now with a full heart this is something that everyone's gonna wanna tune in for\nUm you know it\nIt's October baseball and I know you said last week October baseball's the best time of year um but\n... has to be the best month and sports I was going to Iran about it last week\nNFL you've got college you got any John NBA preseason exact exactly four days\nExactly um but for baseball I'm\nAbsolutely great weekend the baseball coming up I'm ... and you look at the second game and the Dodgers in ... and I'm going back to the NFL but\nYou're from the engine rye you versus Wade Miley these are two underrated pitchers that no one really talks about and the only time they did of never they were terrible with well he's obviously been with the Dodgers a lot but he's proven himself this year\n... has been a he hasn't been this like a really known dominant pitcher since what the diamond back\nDays yeah but I Will not even the fact is I thought he was a lot of he was getting a lot of scrutiny because of him being with um Arizona and that's fair because Arizona wasn't the best team ever and and it's it's like go back in the NFL you got a great person you got a great player on the team\nBut if your team came back you up and you have to carry them\nThen it obviously makes you it brings you down with them um and a single quick look at where Molly stats um if I can pull 'em up here you know he's only thirty thirty one years old so he's getting out there but so far I'm\nThis season he's five and two with a two point five seven ... exactly I don't look at other organs postseason he's he he only pitched one game but that's because they swept the competition\nUm he only won four and two thirds innings only giving up three hits one walk to strike out um here's a whip of point eight six which is great um opponents are hitting one Seventy six against them so we definitely keeping them off the bases um during the season it's two thirty seven which is absolutely great\nAnd then he hasn't given up a run yet in the postseason um but here here we also have the Dodgers line up with the OSCE Yelp wig Justin Turner you got all these people out there who can\nThink he he can still he could still crank went out when he needs to absolutely he's more of a college player and then we also ... he he's another ... name he used to be a huge name and the unhealthy but I'm a recent events called a slump a [laughter]\nReally causes them to not be talked about much um but honestly as I said before\nHouston and Dodgers are going to the world series Boston I don't think has what it takes to make a World Series push granted they are a hundred hundred plus when team um\nI think Houston overall has a better pitching rotation better a defensive game and overall heading matchup Dodgers they have a chip on the shoulder Milwaukee they're surprising everyone here this year ... you know just barely being the cubs and the ... and then\nGoing on to reach the ... the championship series which no one predicted um\nI I just think daughters have an upper hand in this one All right um [noise]\nYeah like you said the these are probably\nA ... to harvest match ups to pick a not not many people like you said expected Milwaukee to have a good great season\nAre coming into the season they rated them or just maybe outside of the playoff raised I Would say yeah probably like matching up with like the fires maybe maybe a little higher yeah not really are not really a team that would be I think it'd be competing for a playoff spot of course but not really um\nChance at winning the world series in most certainly not at all I think I think a lot of people actually predicted the cubs to go back this year or the cardinals but ... what are they turned out yeah [laughter]\nUm but I think she um I think\nI'm going to go with the I'm going to go the Dodgers in Boston go into the world series I like what the Dodgers have done maintaining the a majority of their team if not all their team is especially adding a mini Machado\nThere are several teams are talking specially the Phillies um so I'm not sure how much money they're gonna dish to him um but Boston has just they've proven time and time out that they have been the best team this uh and I will be the season ah the Houston is\nDefinitely going to be a very difficult match up especially with out to say and players like Garrett called dressed in Berlin and they got playoff experience they won the world is course last year but Boston I just think that Boston is going to be the better team and this one I like that the advantage of them having four games\nOr if it goes game seven uh in Boston\nBut I'm going to say that the Dodgers Milwaukee goes six and she's the boss and go seven\nBut I'm\nDrifted you have anything to add to the baseball conversation actually yes uh being that\nA few of my friends or Yankees fans I thought it was absolutely humiliating the way they got embarrassed in that game three sixteen to one I think that was larger is ridiculous largest loss in franchise history especially considering when you have a franchise and has the most titles and then we'll be history you should have put up with better fight than that I'm Sorry sixteen to one is pathetic\nI bash the Yankees on ah my ... our podcasts court for power cast this uh this weekend it's coming out on Monday I'm but I was saying how if you're a Yankees fan that was the worst possible thing to happen especially the rent so if you if you\nPut up a series and he said that you were going to play the red Sox and it was going to be the Yankees that was the worst possible way that you could have played in a series sixteen and one is a joke it really is I feel bad for the Yankees fans shame on to the Yankees legacy\nReally ... the rivalry between the two because they did it at Fenway so obviously Yankee fans that they weren't there they're not going to be as supportive and if anything it's it gives the rats\nHe's sixteen to one ... one of their best pitchers in the rotation going I think less than four innings come on there that really damp or the rivalry um grabs the Boston though I mean seriously ... I think a lot of people thought that New York was going to come out on top of that series\nWell and I would like to give my ex uh I think the shows 'cause in baseball I think ... most anyone will agree with you that pitching determines the winter and Justin Berliner Garrett cool you got a lot of pictures on the team that are just doing his splendid John I mean honestly I I think they will go all the way this year\nNot to break you up but it was in New York the sixth one loss\nEven worse yeah now now that's what I thought I just didn't I just wanted to ah well I'm Glad you've actually because now I can like sort of overly redeem myself you lose sixteen one at home to your most hated rival\nHow does that make you look strong and the funny thing now is Red Sox fans are going to say well we can do at home or away so now that gives them more of a fire to think they're going to win the world series which they they can say that I I honestly I'm not taking away from the red Sox but definitely do hinder the rivalry definitely karma definitely harm I think\nFor the New York Yankees fans and wanting Boston days were screaming at all a game on during that while they wanted\nThey want to Boston but they got it they got it and they got it and it was too ... they're one of the most arrogant fan bases and we put painful rightfully try for when he was a little areas yeah and I will say rightfully so they have reason to be however I don't feel that sympathetic towards their fan base\nNo no no compensation\nAnd counting sorry we wasn't asking how did you feel about the
