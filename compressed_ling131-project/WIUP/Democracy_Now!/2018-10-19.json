and I think uh we really need to concentrate on the context of all this and how the United states is two\nAnd not wanting to make or break or maybe acknowledge that the Saudi regime whether it's somehow had been set amount or his so called rogue elements within the regime are responsible for this\nBut I Can't imagine how a a janitors entering the ... the state disappears and this is we have the video that\nWithout actually the finger pointing to the involvement of the Saudi regime and possibly that talk person in the Saudi regime and that is crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nSuch a

that are wealthy that are capable of transferring to a hundred million dollars to the U.S on the day off the visit of it's a a secretary of state\nAnd uh it is that's money that actually meat sauce to stagnate in the relationship with the Saudi regime that continues to attack\nA basic human rights inside this country but this act if it actually happened uh inside the consulate in Istanbul which is a new phase that we are seeing a and and Saudi Arabia\nBut it's the Saudi regime is allowed to find\nA scapegoat or a cover story that with a low with from any responsibility for the murder of Jim I

be confused with the U.S not supporting Saudi Arabia for\nAh you had President Obama visited Saudi Arabia I Believe something like four times President Trump's first foreign visit was to Saudi Arabia where he did the famous or I I a vent and I did the shore dance et cetera\n\nWell this is the history of this relationship goes back to the ... after the second World War and the discovery of oil and Saudi Arabia the United states did not have any interest in a ... a beer at that time as it was called\nOn to our oil was discovered by a an American company\nAnd it is the oil company that brought the U.S government into Saudi Arabia rather than the other way round\nSo we have the oil we have the money that needed to be protected officer to be a a signing off a contract for a third of exploration off the possibility of or a on the floor of Arabia\nSo the ... the United states government was brought in to protect the interests of the corporation the oil company that discovered the oil and started pumping it\nAnd the United states found in Saudi Arabia as strategic ally it's had initially the ministry base in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia where oil was found and the military base was used by the United states\nIn the Nineteen fifties so they ... it was extremely important and at that time a child you or it was important for the United states and the rest of the world because at at the moment we find that the U.S is less dependent on ...\nAnd the justification for this close partnership between Saudi Arabia and the United states from the U.S perspective has always been that we need Saudi Arabia because Saudi Arabia is a force of stability in the middle east\nAnd they use Saudi Arabia in the Cold War to launch that jihad in Afghanistan with the U.S approvals and support and Saudi Arabia was actually conveying\nAdds a actively participating in that at a jihad in the Nineteen eighties\nBut also that is a district in addition to the economic importance of Saudi Arabia the strategic location of Saudi Arabia\nThe importance of Saudi Arabia to the rest of the Muslim world and the Cold War or Saudi Arabia and specifically it's religious tradition that is known to everybody as though we're happy tradition was a very convenient ... ideology to counter for example\nAnti imperialist to a a a\nIdeology in the Nineteen sixties uh\nArab nationalism and also socialism so as Islamic fundamentalism was promoted by Saudi Arabia in cooperation with the United states as a counter strategies to all the threatening forces in the world at the time from the perspective of both the U.S and Saudi Arabia\nHowever at when we come to the present and we come to the election of Mr Donald Trump Saudi Arabia ed at as you said of course it did to receive that President Obama a in Saudi Arabia and\nDeeply enmeshed in the Washington establishment not to mention the Saudi establishment um there is now worried that a group of right wing U.S Congress members are I've been to\nAs a matter of ... is not a a usual order typical dissidents or opposition figure\nHe started his career as Saudi Arabia as a journalist and he was a very close to the Saudi Government\nSo let's just explain what it means to be a journalist and Saudi Arabia it's nothing like being a journalist in any other country in the west for example so all the newspapers are either owned by the government or by individual princess\nAnd therefore he was an employee of the states in his capacity as a journalist and he developed his started writing in Arabic and uh several Saudi newspapers some of them are pan Arab they are directed towards the Arab world\nBut he continued to be very very close to the Saudi regime\nAs a writer but also as a defender off a policy is that's where introduced over the years so to ... he had probably his best days where during the day rule of King Abdullah\nSo he he was promoting not democracy because if he did that at the time he would have ended up in prison\nAnd but he was almost like the praising King Abdullah and praising his so called reforms I mean the the the word reforms comes up every time we have a new king but we we we don't go far in that reform so\nAll so that was a ... he was close to al ... who is probably a known to western or just says as the ... the businessman who ah\nOwns and means yeah empire that he started in in Saudi Arabia and uh he wanted to ... to be the director offend you\nYou're right this I'm a news channel but it is very very interesting that that news channel last is two hours and it's worth shutting down by on orders from the Saudi regime\nAnd therefore how should he returned to Saudi Arabia I continue to arise and until king settlement unemployment been sending mine came to power and that's when he and began to and\nHave a difficult relationship at all so let's not forget that one of his main jobs at was as an advisor and spokesperson to prince Turki al ... who was the ex director of intelligence in Saudi Arabia\nNature he became the ambassador of Saudi Arabia in Washington\nAnd London so he he was very close to that person then ... at the time when ... came to power\nHe ... he almost like we had no patron anymore because he wasn't close to the new\nGuards that came with ... and therefore he was banned from writing he was suspended and until suddenly he appears in Washington and started writing for the Washington Post so my ass in July ... should not be regarded as\nAn opposition figure as a dissident he is a defector from one and then the court orders of power of the Saudi regime\nAnd he moved to Washington which really\nThe Saudis I think simply because he's close to the patrons who the protectors of the Saudi regime that's not forget that Saudi Arabia defense for security on the U.S and and therefore ... he began\nDo they have a job on how she was you know it was too much perhaps and they did not want this to go further\nSo that was the story of him attending conferences in London and going all sorts of stumbled onto a we saw that video of entering they sowed they called ...\nAnd looking for a document that's the story that we got from his fiance who was waiting for him outside the confidence\nThat he needed a document to say that his divorce his wife in Saudi Arabia and therefore he wouldn't be able to be married in Turkey\nAnd so this is the story that we have this isn't the machine and\nI appear to a gym about how she was on television and Andrea Jew or when he was the spokesperson of ... I saw that in ... in London we disagreed\nSo many things but I must say that he was very polite person who wasn't defending that he was defending that came the policies of backing them at that time in his role as the spokesperson for them buses\nAre interestingly the middle east I is reporting Saudi authorities band has shrunk chief from writing and newspapers appearing on TV and attending conferences after his remarks during a presentation he made it a Washington think tank on November tense\nI'm In which he which critical of Donald Trump's ascension to the presidency was right after Trump's election in the last\nMinute that we have viewer peace in the New York times why king Solomon must replace NBS talk about what you think has\nTo happen now\nI mean I think we should leave the investigation of the possible murder of july's too is that right the people who are actually who knows what they're doing what what is that\nGave them orders and is it is proven that must have been sending money is responsible that are two things that could save Saudi Arabia at this moment\nWon a king sound mind must sack his sons and find an alternative crown prince he should go into a sink into oblivion because his name associate is associated with the smarter and if that if there is evidence to prove that\nThe second thing I I Believe that just replacing them ... mind with another prince is not enough that has to be a political change in Saudi Arabia to mitigate against the mergers often you MBBS and an\nAbsolute monarchy we can't just simply wait and hope that then future king would be better than the previous one that is no mechanism in Saudi Arabia to mitigate against the merchants of somebody like the\nPrevious kings I mean we focus on MPs as if Saudi Arabia had like enjoyed a certain kind of openness or democracy or that they added amounts of free speech it's never been a free country\nAnd therefore and kinks out of mind if he wants to save Saudi Arabia from future upheaval civil wars et cetera he needs to start thinking and making a pledge that Saudi Arabia would become a constitutional monarchy in which the U.S our will become a\nSymbolic figures in order to and now a transition to more democratic system and we haven't even mentioned I Do not support any monarchy whether it's a\nAbsolute monarchy or echoes the tuition monarchy like the ones that we have in the Arab world and even in that constitutional arrangement we still have that the king interferes in everything and we have examples\nAs it appears to prepare Saudi Arabia for a better future then that can must act now however I have my doubts because kinks out of mind is very old and he may not be aware\nOf the severity of what his son may\nHave done and and and that's for to focus the mind off of the the world ... on this change is extremely important\nBecause Saudi Arabia is locked in a country with the resources for its own people it's a country that is relevant to the world economy and if we have a situation in Syria in Saudi Arabia\nOr along the lines off for Syria Yemen or Iraq then the whole world with field the shock\nAnd we haven't even talked about Yemen as a\nCrown prince is being accused of orchestrating the I'm a killing of a Jamal ... him um piece by piece or you have the children of Yemen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "city": "Indiana", "day": "19"}
