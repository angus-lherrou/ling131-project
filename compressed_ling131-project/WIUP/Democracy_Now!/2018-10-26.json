don't have it structurally tired of the house so it doesn't do damage to the house so whatever's down there is going to be wiped away what I mean my big promote grill is gone and the big monster real

I went my roof they're one of the things that I can show you in the house that that we did last\nFor forty five ... chocolate at the meaning of that you know um\nIt was just a slight difference\nCouple of thousand dollars it seems like to go a little bit deeper on the pilings for that many different ... I don't know thirty may have been just fan\nSo explain the first floor\nIs not a house sits will handle water congestion we talk\nOur cars that's Raj and there was a storage room back there and best Georgia was gone it's just walk twenty like he was never there because the ocean just went through the first floor and it took it\nTook it out and the building behind you there where the where the workmen are um water was on that second floor Eighteen Inches they told me Eighteen Inches in that second floor [noise]\nAnd we don't have any signs of water in on the ground floor to see where it was because they said it came in clean and then further you get in on the more the more you see the\nMarks on the walls so we don't know ... you know where we work so we know we lost around floor and and it was probably right up to the to the ceiling down there and\nThen of course there the water just came in and then it receded and you had nothing there to\nGo in and took out other people though\nAnd and then my debris can cause trouble downstream so that's why we're looking at right now is how do we do things where we survive\nWe have the minimum amount of damage and we don't damage to the people\nYou want to show me what you have inside the only thing that I\nThat I didn't follow the engineers advice on was this area here\nSo we had our little camera a fair they watched the whole storm coming Monday I couldn't watch it but if you kept calling me and I kept hanging up owning a\nBecause you are too upset if I could I couldn't but it's just a compelling\nBecause they don't come in for people who watch the fear go out to us\nEverything you see probably [noise]\nThere's been torn down this was the road to the pier and the recount houses on both sides of the road all build ...\nSo all or most of them they're all destroyed and that's true everywhere on both sides of highway not hear the way you mentioned that you talk to her don't do well there you know or don't go to go here\nWas do you think people should build so close to the ocean\n...
