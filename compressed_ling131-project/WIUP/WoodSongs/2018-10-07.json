H. O. R. L. yes okay and has them as a meaning so\nFor me to really invokes the natural world you know you find world and your fingertips implants formation sea shells and something about this process for us was really getting into intuition and trying to let go of preconceived notions so some of the music came out in these kinds of\nGuys playing fiddle a violin or a classically trained uh since uh since a kid\nYeah look classical music I mean if it's all like to me I think the older I get is all just like music really the people I Love my some of my favorite classical musicians they just grew up in it just like\nAny style of folk music or you know maybe you grow up in in a plane rock whatever it is it's it's similar so I Love the different styles that the violent travels through the world and through cultures plane and that's really been a joy to explore\nThe journey going from classically trained playing by the note in in ... one of those notes is a really an art form but going from the that\nLeap that cliff dive going from the notes to playing what's in your heart with no notes in front of you tell me about that\nFor me it was a little more simultaneous growing up and and ah maybe never focusing quite enough I was doing a lot of these different things and tried to dig in but I think that can be a\nSomething that can can feel like an impasse for people a lot of time but I you know when I'm teaching I Try to just help people get into the sand boxes play around it's okay it's okay you have to start somewhere so uh I think it's the same process where the starting out or whether you're playing in a professional group\nWell you uh were rightfully praising the musicians the that are playing with the standing next to you on mandolin Josh pink amongst you come over here let's say Hi to Josh Shenk among [noise] soda Nineteen seventies\nThis writer a named John land that went to see a Bonnie rate concert in Cambridge, Massachusetts\nAnd onstage that night he saw a a kid named Bruce Springsteen and he said I have seen the future of rock and roll and it launched the Bruce Springsteen a career mandolin magazine I came across\nFree scene of the mandolin over here so that may be that must have been a very big on or when you realize that they thought that highly of your\nYour plane yeah it really was man it was um it was kind of surreal but super kind I'm yeah I'm very appreciative\nAnd how did you uh connect with the with the German and then formed a scrape Germany and I met at\nA this really great workshop I'm at Carnegie Hall that uh\nEdgar Meyer and Mike Marshall were hosting and um they had a bunch of years of ours come in and and listen to is the weakest we're working on a concert of music of our own a\nBunch of young musicians around the country I'm getting prepared for a concert that we would then do at Carnegie\nCool well let's let's hear what the future of the mandolin sounds like I'm going to get you to come up to the to the microphone but the mandolin magazine was extremely high with their praise you give us get us twenty thirty seconds or something on your mandolin mandolin yeah\n\n[noise]\nUnless they are kind\nA ... Jeremy in a nice way for you to connect with Josh on the mandolin 'cause the the two incidents are centrally tune the same yeah fingering as close and so you get to follow each other pretty closely right\nAbsolutely and it's funny you mentioned that because our next tune here I heard just playing the violin peas and it's really an old time tune it's and really old time like Eighteen century early ... century Germany um but we uh I heard Josh ...\nBull judgment to add notes to competition by genius bar which is what it was\nA perfect competition it didn't eat anything but a played in the group there are some other possibilities perhaps so we\nHave this piece called ...\nWell let's go ahead and check it out from their CD cold world's W.
