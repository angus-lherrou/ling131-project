you here and thank you for having I Would love it I I grew up near a Little Rock Arkansas\nOh excellent that's where I was born\nAnd yeah and you are made your way to national went to college out there to learn how to be an artist in a songwriter so that must have been a brave move for you to go from Arkansas to Nashville in that kind of community were\nJust overflowing with skill and talent and you go to college to learn how to do it\nWell luckily I don't think I knew any better at the time so scared as I could have been with\nThe the odd thing is that you actually accomplish did you super seated all the expectations you became a big\nSuccess [noise]\nSo you're driving as let's talk about the the Allen Jackson cut because a lot of times a lot of times um you write a song an artist likes it and they kind of put a hold on it for a while yeah and it's sort of precludes another artist from recording it so you had an artist\nTechnically put a hold on on a song that came to Ellen Jackson's detention\nTell them tell me how that happened that time was actually on hold for two other artists for the year proceeding when Alan hurt it added a publisher at the time who played it for Allen's producer and he put it on hold his for another artist at first but it turned out they weren't sure about the timeline for that album and what was going to go on that one\nSo you know what I don't know exactly when it's going to be cutting and so I don't want her to miss that\nWhen I was a song Monday morning church was beautiful beautifully written\nToo [noise] so [noise]\nWaiting for something that you knew that there were art is interested in the song and you're waiting and you're waiting and you it was\nKilling 'em know again I didn't really know anything at that point in time Alan actually ended up hanging out on spring break my senior year in college\nAnd and what tell me about the first time you've heard it you're you're probably in your car like everybody else and listening to the radio\nActually uh Gary Overton Eddie and mine was kind enough he got a copy of it because he's worked with Allen for years\nAnd he has kind of stand by me and to hear that cut and you know it's really it's a strange thing it's almost like you're watching a TV show or maybe somebody hooked up a computer and ran your song through it and\nMade it sound like somebody else it was it was really amazing what about the first time you heard it on the radio you heard Allen singing your song on the radio well I I don't know if he's seen a movie called a thing called love but it was about like that drive down music row and heard it and\nWe're actually on music growing here yeah wow the talk of the serendipity those stars were lining up for you that\nSaid another claim to fame that you had and this is kind of important in Kentucky and all because he was the voice of Kentucky tourism now but you were a Chris Stapleton upstairs neighbor I was yeah so so what was that like he must have been an interesting uh fill a downstairs probably singing and working all the time really helped me carrying a wardrobe upstairs nice guy\nSo what let's talk about the changes in the music business because I mean the last ten years has\nReally affected the not the music and the musician so much because they're still there and they're still passionate and they're still working and trying but the music\nTechnology is changing so fast um\nYou know I think about my granny growing up she didn't even have the radio when she was born and uh what all we can do today and it's really amazing to think about all the innovation that's happened and I to me I think it's a good thing because I think there's a lot of possibilities for independent artists that maybe weren't there before\nAnd you you have a lot of independent nature in your career and so I mean you're getting major cuts with with important artist but but you are a singer songwriter that also views yourself as an artist\nAs as one of those performers that's what I moved to Nashville for I I really I started writing songs to have things to saying and I'm I think I was lucky in that way because maybe I didn't over thinking when I was trying to ride I just tried to write something I Love and\nI'm kind of fell into it\nSo now you have a you you have this series of\nOf singles that you sort of releasing on your own one of the time told me about that don't tell me what you're doing there\nWell I put out an album last fall called with the town crier that I'm really proud of Jimmy Johnson and Jim is brown ... I say that I was a kid in the country music candy store get to do that has got to have all my favorite players into play got some friends of mine ah Chris came in and saying on a couple of songs and rainy Hauser and Ricky Skaggs\nWas just a really special experience and then since then I've been recording some\nKind of one off more clues to base song uh just because you know as an artist it takes a long time to do an album that you want to have something new and fresh she wasn't fresh baked cookies out their share with your audience\nWill Allen Jackson even said it in one of the songs lordy don't the wheels turn slow and it sort of it is true and it takes a lot of ah\nThere's a lot of work being patient through the through the process but speaking of whiskey town crier which is a great great titles 'cause that's that's what they used to call\nThe news or on a state of a community yeah it's actually it's a famed record and so it's basically supposed to be an auditory newspaper for a small town and I'm really big into characters in stories on so each one of these songs could be\nA little a article\nIn the local paper well a lot of places that we can recommend living things like really sad it's like well a heartache\nSo pretty good these days so now you've got this beautiful album is called whiskey town cry or going to dip into that album for this particular song is called ... just like her cowboys Aaron enderlin on the ... song sold for\nUm\nThey were they didn't\nI Love you know\nThat my knees redone um\nFood's one of the kids in this\nBusiness then\nDo they then ... and then he ... many times these ...\n... ...\n...\nYou are huh\nMm\nSay all those pretty big you know I ...\nUm\nI'm\nLucky that day\n...\nYou know\n... ...\n... ... ... ... ...\n... probably go to the man who snow ... and\n...\nThen in those ... ...\n... ... ... ... new\nBook with drinking and he then then thanking them\nHe didn't do ...\n\nRolled in her ...
