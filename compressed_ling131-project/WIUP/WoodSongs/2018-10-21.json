Burgess back there [noise]\nAnd of course the artist is a grandma voice Smith granted nice to have you here filing oh glad to be your mind\nWhat an amazing project that uh that in this this era of America's history someone would turn their attention back to this incredibly dramatic time in its history so what where did your interest in the depression era and the dust bowl I'm situation in America\nWas actually kind of an accident I was running a song one day and you know I'm sure you're a songwriter much of his own writers and you just throw out ideas and I just had this idea for a song that\nEventually turned it into a ... a song that sounded like it was about a drought and I thought well that's I got to change that because no one wants to hear a song on drones but uh no matter what I tried I could not change it I had to have those words and so I thought well that was a big drought one time what was that\nI went on the Internet and I sat there for seven hours ... burst into ... minutes refreshing whatever I learned in school which wasn't much and then I expanded my knowledge I open the next two three years it took me to write the album and I think I could run a ...\nRecorded on film in the Nineteen seventies I was just amazed\nWell it it it is truly one of the most dramatic moments in American history especially what happened to its own its own people I mean you know and Woody Guthrie which you know he made his name is supporting the poor people of the dust bowl era but he was from there he was from Oklahoma\nYou were born in Jacksonville and you kind of moved up north to Rhode Island and he'd been like all over the place having you having you interpret this is really kind of a neat thing because you're you're really opening your first\nAnd you took your time on this album he spent almost three years ago I made it twice\nI recorded at once and threw it all away and start all over again so what why why wouldn't you throw it away you know there wasn't good enough\nWell that would be a good reason and I didn't have that song I just played just now I didn't have that one yet or the other one another one that will still I'm caught him I said my prayer pronouncing that right you can't pronounce it right because the the Choctaw people by the way they taught me how to say how do you say how do you say it's ... but they use L H A T H like\nThey use our alphabet because they never did have a written ... let's give them ... to properly\nAstronomical means have strengthened the Choctaw language\nAnd I actually I knew a friend of mine said you got to write a song about the Native Americans during the dust bowl\nThis was after I got through with the first version of the record and I said oh man you're exactly right but I don't know how to write such a song because I'm not a Native American idol\nI think if I wrote one that just wouldn't be true enough so I contacted after I realized the Choctaw were the first of the five tribes marched and the trail of tears a hundred years before the dust bowl I contacted the Choctaw tribe and they helped me so much right the song I have to give them a giant thank you and\nThey deserve a lot of credit well it's nice that you were\nYou are you do this and you put the put the album\nBe really aware of the dust bowl or what was happening in America at that time so this is like a whole education\nThing going is actually created a one man show or to have a twelve foot video screen behind me and I've got hundreds of the pictures that were taken back then\nAnd I did it for the high school in Bakersfield, California about seven months ago and I couldn't believe I had some some kids now they're just kids understand they haven't learned about it yet but they live in ...\nTheir whole lives and they came up to me a couple of them and said how come you're how come you mentioned Bakersfield a few times in these songs we don't get it so there there's a lot that needs to be I think informed you're\nWelcome bankers field was the site of a lot of the grows that supposedly advertise for workers and and your hands up ... of people from Oklahoma and Kansas went to areas like Baker she'll end there were no jobs\nThere was like ... one job for every thousand people that can you get one\nYeah I mean it's uh it it it truly and it really moved a Woody Guthrie in his heart I mean these were his people yes this was his family these were his neighbors these this was people of the cloth he was cut from\nAnd some of his songs you know absolutely brilliant really stand up even even to this day but you know congratulations you to you on your effort dust bowl American stories is name a CD let's get into another song this is a tune called the boy who built the moon great title grant Lloyd Smith on the would solve\n[noise]\nThey need her and so do\nI'm going to take the hand\nThe ... name the by\nWell Shane and\nOn the ball and new ... ...\n\n\nHave erode away this week

their\nGreat see deep dig in the dirt is the former hands on our broadcast dawn hill is the banjo player and he has won the state banjo champion Alabama Kentucky and Tennessee fine musicians\nBeen on network television and everything I mean a lot of art is a lot of folks in the audience want to become a songwriter and it's kinda tough out there right now\nYou know I suppose it is I got encouraged to ride as a teenager and and it continues to be a a\nLearning process and work in progress and the great thing about our enemies bluegrass music in our industry has most of the artist or very approachable and and lots of bands don't have we're blessed we have lots of songwriters in our bedroom with a lot of bands down and so they're always looking for material that's a lot easier to get it to those people\nAnd in bluegrass especially is very family and kid conscious and they they really the doors in bluegrass music are wide open welcoming just about everybody reason I Love bluegrass festival is because the best music is not necessarily played on stage in the camp grounds and the parking lot right\nIn the name artist go down into the camp grounds and parking lots to play with sure folks\nSo is this something that you've been around since we were kids\nNot really I actually got my first professional singing job as a teenager singing that little rental ends ranch out in a very
