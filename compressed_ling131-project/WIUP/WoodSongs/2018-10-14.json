city in this whole record\nYou know my whole life um I've always felt like I had something to play 'em and with this record it's because I had something to say\nWell let's start or you you grew up in Vermont and because of your mom you got to sing in a lot of clubs and stuff even though you weren't technically allowed inside\nYeah you know when you're in the early seventies you could get in the glove get away with them yeah I got to hear so much live music I mean I bet that song has a lot of my trip and we did we went barter barn to clubs and festivals and we were in every you know smoking country bar you could imagine you know a around our our area and I got to hear a lot of music\nSo you're from Vermont to the Ryman Auditorium that's pretty big spread of culture which you absorbed at all in in in the writing of the songs for southern gothic I mean originally you weren't planning on doing the ... album with these songs no none of these ...\nI mean you write songs hoping that someone will you know cut your songs but um I found myself for the first time in my life I'd written a couple of songs I was driving home and I was jealous form I I really wanted them for myself\nAnd uh you know I I prayed about it I let them go I said I Know I just I Hope they find a good home and somehow they found their way back to me so I was a I was thrilled when I when I found out I had a chance to\nDo that is a ... that that is in the current music world being the artist out front\nIs is more difficult it's a one hand it's easy to get the music out there on another hand it's more difficult to make a living getting the music out there because the music business has changed\nSo much sure it's it's hard you know and and for myself I have always loved all the aspects of it so when\nI'm On the road I Want to be recording when I'm recording I Want to be on the road you know if I'm neither one of you know I Want to be writing when I'm not\nDoing that so it's it's nice to be able to to to be a part of all the different sides of it\nAnd what's nice about your careers that you were you been able to reach into many different projects that have been a very successful and congratulations to you because that's such a difficult", "show_name": "WoodSongs", "year": "2018", "city": "Indiana", "day": "14"}
