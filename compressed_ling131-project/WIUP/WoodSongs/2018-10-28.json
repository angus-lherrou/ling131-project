truck driver when he approached a\nA son records and stuff that you come from a truck drivers family I Do so the spirit of of all of that is certainly part of your own DNA and tell me about the the the songs on the record the songs on red hot there are all part of the sun original catalog correct\nAre um uh the producers are cameras in a looser Dickinson\nPut together a house band in our in the house band and a loser himself guitar and his brother Cody north Mississippi all stars they put like drums\nAnd Rick step of loose zero like a piano and that was the house band we backed up various sort of Memphis related artists like ... and uh I'm a young boy at heart Valerie June and uh uh bought her a shot showing camp is on the lam and uh really\nTemporary a kind of tackling that material and I I thought it was a cool selection of material there's some really well known stuff but there's also some pretty obscure stuff on there too which I thought was cool to sort of represent\nAnd giving props were props or do of course we know who Luther is a camera is a a\nIs a true patriot of of many artists she's supporting guy Clark working heavily with Chris christopherson right now and she's really supported the legacy of many artist so the idea of her working on the tribute to sun records is certainly appropriate for her we'll have\nNice and I see him around\nAnd so you're you're Tom tell me about your interest in the Memphis Sound and you as an artist your interest in the Memphis Sound your interest in the music that Sam Philips brought forward or through the vehicle of sun records is this something you were interested in this little kid or does come out well\nI mean I wasn't fully aware of what's on records was when I was a kid I was familiar with some of the music but it wasn't until I was\nYou know a teenager that I was playing music already that I've sort of study to Doug in and started realizing this was all under one sort of umbrella you know the stuff that I heard was vaguely aware of as a child a became obsessed with us and then when I realized it was all one thing I was like oh wow I Am\nCompletely completely changed my whole way of saying about music like it does for anybody that really delves into that catalog but um that was a before I ever moved in Memphis and then I moved here about twelve Thirteen Years ago and uh\nI'm just really got to be a full time student Memphis music and get to be immersed in it and around some of the people that made it and it's just been a real uh\nUh it's been an amazing sort of experience as a musician living there and soaking up the Memphis thing kind of being an outsider but now can totally considering you know\nThe one thing the Memphis did um risk stacks records are records are to you know there's the the there there is not a Memphis down there are Memphis Sounds you know\nWell and here we are celebrating one of those sounds as as delivered by Sam Philips and has a record label son record Amy you worked at sun records as as a tour guide was talking about the recording studio room where all of this magic happened Roy ... Johnny Cash\nJerry Lee Lewis a course Elvis recorded his stuff there's not a big room\nNotice this stage might need bigger than the actual tracking\nRound one car garage really was a radio show it was a radiation and\nAll it has these uh white acoustic tiles on the walls and a four with his best is best is tiles on foot and the ceiling was real odd it had this little battles peaks and valleys all along the top of the ceiling which\nHelped to sound in there and then one big glass window and family perched up looking through the window with the band\nAnd the way was the way the room was portrayed in and walk the line which you were part of the motion picture in one of the actresses and in that that movie that was a very accurate portrayal of of the room and the way Sam Phillips work with the artists\nIt was they actually um I actually knew some of the set\nBuilders and they built it\nPretty they build a whole nother studio down main street meant they were the storefront to look just like it inside there because they the owner assign was respectful to the people that come from all over the world to see signs studio that he didn't want to close it to the public\nSelling said they had to build that uh\nThey had to build their own\nYou know what we had to record the sensations at night\nYeah but only at night do they do they have to do they have the same\nRecording board that they had the old the old so there's a whole new stuff yeah yeah oh that's new will\nHave the actual the actual yeah they do actually have one of the portable recording devices that seem used to go around and make field recordings of Bruce ... that's in the museum and that's really cool things in the studio\nNeedle the actual console that same ad is at the rock and roll museum\nOr that they actually still exists is just just not they're not operators amazing I give props were props is due again I mean it's amazing how good those records sound even today on the modern sound systems with the gear that they had to record back then so it's a\nCombination of really great songs really great musicians and Sam's ears and the engineers that he\nHe worked with well it's a it's an album that does a fitting tribute to that legacy it's called red hot it's a tribute to Sam Philips and the music of sun records and we're going to turn our attention to John Paul kid this was a tune called red Cadillac and black moustache right here on the wood songs old time\n\nYou know\nAlone to get rid of a\nGood maybe\nA\nLittle you know the uh [noise]\nAround ... news ...\nWho's been a little annoying REM lose you\n... do you at the regular day\nTo die in the gathering\n\nAnd I want the radio audience to know that the upright bass is taller than you are\nReally that those are some really flattering word\nAt how the Trump told me about wanting to play the upright bass and that's something that started a young family ban how to do all that what was the inspiration for that\nWhy not the harmonica somewhat easier I Know\nI really I\nKept records and writing songs and I still right on the guitar quite a bit um but I\nI never really got very good at it and one afternoon I picked up a friend that bite base and I discovered that it was one note at a time\nAnd it was a lot easier for me and I just said I could dance with it and I took to it and I\nI just started home with the base\nWell let's listen to some of the magic that you can do one noted of time on an upright bass from or CD hallelujah I'm a dream or this is a tune called cricket it is Amy ... here on the wood song\n... way up to you then\nSomething woman goes into\nThe man later in the\nSometimes he smokes ... terms he\nThat he always raises radio and gives you the\n[noise]\nOn ...\nMm\nThe creek in trying to get\nGood\nAmy Lou here the brilliant guitar playing or a husband will Sexton over there and Mr John Paul Keith was as we're well on John you're gonna you're and you're going to do a song now from a a project that you and Amy do together\nYeah we have a band called motel mirrors or I mean I started a a few years ago a to do do it together with our friendship ... drums just a little trio doing it's kind of old classic country and rock and roll do at kind of stuff and then a\nA a kind of grew into a real band I started writing songs I've never written do it before and it was like a new challenge and\nAnd a new new experiment and you need to do and how we uh we you know here we are a few years later still doing it we have a new record caught in the meantime that's coming out in a few months and or will it into ban now and a\nFull time so uh it's a it's a big family ban\nAnd again in the subject of what the hours about Sam Philips and son records of people are going to hear you performed a song do it with Amy and it's it's pretty much in the same DNA realm of what Sam Philips and son records are produced as part of the American musical\nCannon yeah yeah I've I've it's very much of a consciously based on that\nAnd I think it's I think it shows the influence an inspiration that sun records catalog had on a whole a gender several generations of artist let's get into\nThe self titled ... seat is called a motel mirror this is a tune called meet me on the corner it is John Paul Keith and Amy live here together on the wood\nWe lay on the phone\nMade me on the phone\nSorrow laughing now I\nYou love your down our street some made me to come\nMillion maybe on the border\nI can get you off by mining can't wait to see you again or\nDo you will or not to weigh up\nGoing out with some friends\nAnd mean me I look\nWithin the last nine\nMade me not to\n[noise]\nKnowing me\nMe me\nMe me\nMe me\nMe me\nBorrow it\nOn the\nMeet me at the corner and let's welcome back Mr O'Brien have to the state [noise]\nAgain [noise]\nAs as a independent artist in your own right you one to the best of Memphis songwriter award so you uh [noise]\nVested interests of the sound of Memphis\nAnd course and you're the associate producer of this a recording project red hot so we had it all that come about so\nAs you mentioned earlier we were um we were meeting with cameras solving yawn oh about a a different completely different project and we were having lunch in Nashville\nAnd all over the course of that lunch we found out what a huge fan of Memphis music she was and what an important role\nA son and that whole catalog had played in her life and so we got to talking and uh\nI'm over the course of a few weeks we throughout the idea of hey what if what if we did one of those tribute album ... albums that that she had done so well I you know a Grammy for a soldier Stephen Foster and of course though this one's for him got car tribute 'em\nYou guys decided to give the proceeds to a very
