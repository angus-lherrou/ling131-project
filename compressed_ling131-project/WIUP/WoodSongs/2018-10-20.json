label that introduced\nSo much incredible music to the world back in the early Nineteen fifties about uh\nAbout Nineteen fifty one young Nineteen year old kid named I\nTurn this was before and Tina\nCame to the Memphis recording studio to record a record and it was called a rocket eighty eight [noise]\nAnd the studio put it out under the name of its own record label\nAnd it became a huge number one hit and this is rocket ADA\nKnow and they may\n\nAnd that wasn't the only Nineteen year old kid that came across the attention of Sam Philips the owner of the Memphis recording studio you know this one\n\n\nOf the world and this became a massive massive record for them\nThey introduced artists like Johnny Cash and Roy Arbesman and and Carl Perkins in so many others and that is what this show is about there is a new album out called the red hot it is uh\nTheir own right here to help us or commemorate not just sun records but the release of this album it's an important now them

truck driver when he approached a\nA son records and stuff that you come from a truck driver family I Do so the spirit of ... of all of that is certainly part of your own DNA and tell me about the the the songs on the record and it's the songs on red hot there are all part of the sun original catalog correct they\nAre um uh the producers are cameras in a looser Dickinson\nPut together a house band Amy and I were in the house band and a loser himself guitar and his brother Cody north Mississippi all stars they put a play drums\nAnd Rick staff of loose zero played a piano and that was the house band and we backed up various sort of Memphis related artists like jumbo masses and uh I'm a young boy at heart and Valerie June and a\nA ... show on campus on lamb and a really cool to a\nA sort of as a selection of artists all kinds of related to Memphis the current in contemporary a kind of tackling that material and I I thought it was a cool selection of material there's some really well known stuff but there's also some pretty obscure stuff on there too which I thought was cool to sort of represent\nAnd giving props were props or do of course we know who lose there is a camera is a a is a true a patriot of of many artist she is supportive guy Clark\nOr working heavily with Chris christopherson right now and she's really a supported the legacy of many artist so the idea of her working on the tribute to sun records of certainly appropriate for her\nWe'll have [noise] nice nice\nYou're interested in the Memphis Sound your interest in the music that Sam Philips brought forward or through the vehicle of sun records or is this something you were interested in this little kid or does come out\nWell yeah I mean I I wasn't fully aware of what's on records was when I was a kid I was familiar with some of the music but it wasn't until I was\nYou know a teenager that I and I was playing music already that I've sort of study to Doug in and started realizing this was all under one sort of umbrella you know the stuff that I heard was vaguely aware of as a child\nA became obsessed with and then when I realized it was all one thing I was like oh wow I Am\nCompletely completely changed my whole way of saying about me that like it does for anybody that really delves into that catalog but um that was a before I ever moved enough us and then I moved there about twelve Thirteen Years ago and uh\nI'm just really got to be a full time student Memphis music and get to be immersed in it and around some of the people that made it and it's just been a real uh\nUh it's been an amazing sort of experience as a musician living there and soaking up the Memphis thing kind of being an outsider but now can totally considering at home you know but ah yeah it's a and and then the Memphis Sound is so broad you know you talk about another sound but there's more than one son records is one thing and it's just it I mean right stacks records Hi Records are to\nYou know there's the the there there's not a Memphis down there in Memphis Sounds you know\nWell and here we are celebrating one of those sounds as as delivered by Sam Philips and has a record label son records Amy you worked at sun records as as a tour guide let's talk about the recording studio room where all of this magic happened Roy ... Johnny Cash\nJerry Lee Lewis a course Elvis recorded his stuff there's not a big room\nStage might be bigger than actual\nWhite acoustic tiles on the walls and for what was his best is best is tiles on the floor\nAnd the ceiling was real odd it had this little metal peaks and valleys all along the top of the ceiling which helped to sound in there and then one big glass window and family perched up looking through the window with the band\nAnd the way was the way the room was portrayed in and walk along which you were part of the motion picture in one of the actresses and in that that movie that was a very accurate portrayal of of the room and the way Sam Phillips work with the artist\nIt was they actually um I actually knew some of the set a builders and they built it pretty they built a whole nother studio down main street Memphis with a storefront to look just like it inside there because they the owner assign was so respectful to the people that come from all over the world\nTo see signs studio that he didn't want to close it to the public for the filming so they had to build the of they had to build their own\nYou know we had to record the sun sessions at night after seven after the initial tours for all we did the daytime social Switzerland operating studio here and I see\nThe but only at night do they do they have ... do they have the same\nRecording board that they had the old the old so this whole new stuff yeah yeah oh stuff new all\nThey don't have the actual the actual here they do actually have one\nOf the portable a recording devices that Sam used to go around and make field recordings of blues artists that's in the museum and it's really cool to see that in the studio at\nAll the actual console that same ad is at the rock and sold museum or that they actually still exist is just not they're not operate is amazing\nOn the modern sound systems with the gear that they had to record back then\nSo it's a combination of really great songs really great musicians and Sam's ears and the engineers that he\nHe worked with well it's a it's an album does a fitting tribute to that legacy it's called red hot it's a tribute to Sam Philips and the music of sun records and we're going to turn our attention to John Paul Keim is a tune called red Cadillac and black moustache right here on the wood songs old time\n\nWho you just said I didn't know\nAlone

to hear you performed the song do it with Amy and it's it's pretty much in the same DNA realm of what Sam Philips and son records are produced as part of the American musical cannon\nYeah yeah I've
