Burgess back there [noise] and of course the artist is a grandma voice Smith Grannis nice to have you here filing overload the ...\nWhat an amazing project that uh that in a ... this this era of America's history someone would turn their attention back to this incredibly dramatic time in American history so what where did your interest in the depression era and the dust bowl a situation in America\nActually kind of an accident I was running a song one day and you know I'm sure you're a songwriter much of a song writers and you just throw out ideas and I just had this idea for a song that eventually turned it into a song that sounded like it was about a drought and I thought well that's I got changed that because no one wants to hear a song on a drunk but\nNo matter what I tried I could not change that I had to have those words and so I thought well that was a big\nIt's refreshing whatever I learned in school which wasn't much and then I expanded my knowledge I over the next two three years it took me to write the album and I think I could write a book about the dust pull now but it it really opened my eyes when I read and listen to interviews of survivors that they tape the recorded on film in the Nineteen seventies I was just amazed\nWell it it it it is truly one of the most dramatic moments in America's history especially what happened to its own\nIts own people I mean you know Woody Guthrie which you know he made his name is supporting the poor people of the ... era but he was from there he was from Oklahoma eat at home you're born in Jacksonville any kind of moved up north to Rhode Island and he'd been like all over the place\nHaving you having you interpret this is really kind of a neat thing because you're really opening\nYour heart as\nAs [noise]\nYou took your time on the south east they're almost three years ago I made it twice I recorded it wants to through it all away and start all over again so why why why wouldn't you throw it away it wasn't good enough\nWell that would be a good reason and I didn't have that song I just played just now I didn't have that one yet or the other one another one that will still I'm told him I said my prime pronouncing it right you can't pronounce it right because the the Choctaw people by the way they taught me how to say how do you say how do you say it's ...\nBut they use L age like AT T H like they use our alphabet because they never did have a written for let's give them ... to properly astronomical means have strengthened the Choctaw\nLanguage and I actually I knew a friend of mine said you've got to write a song about the Native Americans during the dust bowl\nThis was after I threw in the first version of the record and I said oh man you're exactly right but I don't know how to write such a song because I'm not a Native American idol I think if I wrote one that just wouldn't be true enough so I contacted after I realize the Choctaw were the first of the five tribes marched and the trail of tears a hundred years before the dust bowl eye contact\n[noise]\nSo you are you do this and you put the put the album out I mean\nHow was it trying to get audiences especially young kids today are not there may not be really aware of the dust bowl or what was happening in America at that time so this is like a whole education thing going is\nActually created a one man show or to have a twelve foot video screen behind me and I've got hundreds of the pictures that were taken back then\nAnd I did it for the high school in Bakersfield, California about seven months ago\nAnd I couldn't believe I had some some kids now they're just kids understand they haven't learned about it yet but they live in banks their whole lives and they came up to me a couple of them and said how come you're how come you mentioned Bakersfield ... times in these songs we don't get it and so there there's a lot that needs to be I think informed hearing welcome Bakersfield\nWas the site of a lot of the grows that supposedly advertise for workers and and your hands of thousands of people from Oklahoma and Kansas went to areas like Bakersfield and there were no jobs\nThere was like ... one job for every thousand people that\nCan get one yeah I mean it's uh it it it ... and it really moved a Woody Guthrie in his heart I mean these were his people yes this was his family these were his neighbors these this was people of the cloth he was cut from\nAnd some of his songs you know absolutely brilliant really stand up even even to this day but you know congratulations you to you on your effort ...
