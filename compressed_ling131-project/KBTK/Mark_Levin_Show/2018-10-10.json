Minnesota in Ohio and Kentucky and Alabama and Texas and Florida there aren't too many mobs pulling people out of pickup trucks because that\nAin't gonna work maybe in Portland it works and what is so despicable the video tonight on Fox there is a Portland police officer in uniform on a motorcycle watching these individuals' shutdown intersections in downtown Portland and doing nothing about

don't know\nTen we have now I you know I think tops of the greatest people ... cops to me like soldiers and I have great respect for police\nBut they're hired by the city of Portland and mayor Ted Wheeler\nIs the political mayor of Portland, Oregon and he allows this activity to happen how about for a month hundreds of in T find black lives matter protesters lay down on the city streets in and around the federal building this top ice individuals from me going to work\nAnd they like incarcerated\nFederal employees in a federal building until the federal police units showed up to escort them out\nCould that ever happen anywhere on the right side of the offensive some right extremist started lay down in front of federal buildings and refused to let law enforcement or out\nThe mayors of the cities or a left wing socialist Democrats would never put up with this behavior from anybody who's a Republican but they allow it on the left side of the fence and why do they do that Craig because it's ...\nTed Wheeler the mere Portland, Oregon knows he stays in power because of individuals like this\nThat that's true and of course the other side of that is if the right if any of us on the right to that you're not hearing about it in the news media\nWe went on if somehow a Republican had shot a Democrat at a baseball practice a year and four months later it still would be big news every night\nBut bought one Hodgkinson ... almost killed Stevens Kelly's and shot him with a rifle and tried to killed dozens of other Republicans it was a one day story the media quickly dropped it because

let's go to Lynn in Traverse City Michigan have been there once or twice it's a beautiful city and Lynn welcome to the market living in show Mark I'm sorry Lynn please go ahead\nYeah on that it's going to say two things one is um being pro life I Am for women's rights because I'm trying to save the lives the female baby and there's no greater than together save a life\nSo there's no argument there\nYou know Lynn I'm pro life too but it's in a developing baby\nIsn't a developing baby a month or two from birth in title do some property rights to live much like much less the day a day after conception to me that's so that's an expression of God's love but can we agree the last three months\nOf pregnancy when a child who wants to live and feels pain and the hard speeding in his brain

notice that almost everything starts out on the microscopic level and for it to advance to the next stage it half half feeling because it's a living thing\nSo that's what I've observed going to two hundred and natural state and provincial park and photographing nature\nAnd the other thing I'd like to say is I think President Trump needs to get some sort of legislation going from laws that are very strict against the harm being done to people based on their political party or their careers\nBecause you know uh the Republican phobia or whatever you want to call it and the hate tort law enforcement it's horrible I mean police officers for example\nIt whenever you see something on TV that uh you know a bad car accident or whatever they're out there and they have those additional and and watching people die or suffer or whatever with them every single day and they don't give these people the credit for what they have to tolerate\nOn a emotional level let alone you know knowing that people just automatically for no reason at all are going to have hate toward them\nAnd I just think that President Trump to have some laws\nThat protect people so you can go into a restaurant and not get harassed\nAnd look at it this way can you imagine the president for rock Hussein Obama ... numerous times except thing in the White House groups of individuals from black lives matter that

and we're just very grounded in the final report card who stand in judgment of and so that's all it goes on your history\nAnd if you want to surround yourself with something that's going to be positive and productive and successful you don't do with people who caused harm\nAnd no one is called in sick of the harm caused by your teeth my black lives matter there there was for Dallas cops every murdered during a black lives matter protests for them\nIt was ... the media didn't cover at like Mr President how do you invite to the White House the organizers of black lives matter when during one of their so called protests against cops for cops were murdered because of the color is a uniform Mr President how can you do that in the media never even asked the question\nWhy do why
