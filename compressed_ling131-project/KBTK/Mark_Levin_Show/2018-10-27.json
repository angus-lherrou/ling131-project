automatically return to the voting list you're not allowed to vote unless you go specifically the Florida clemency board did he do that did he get approval\nI mean this guy in two thousand two in two thousand two he made a bomb threat [noise] he made a bomb threat in two thousand two\nHe's not a clean slate\nThe way he was right the perpetrator before he was caught was portrayed\nThe insinuation from Schumer and Pelosi the insinuation from CNN and MSNBC was there was a direct line between Trump and his rhetoric and whoever was doing this\nThat was the insinuation that if pushed him over the edge and that\nThis is what causes it sort of know it doesn't but has multiple felonies in his past the guy threatened to use a bomb in two thousand two\n\nThat's pretty uh long before Donald Trump even flirted with the idea of running for president United States\nHe was arrested in two thousand two according to the Associated Press on charges of threatening to throw place projector discharge

of the facts\n\nAnd I'm sure now that the New York slime so Washington compost the constipated news network MSL honesty and all the rest of them are working feverishly to figure out how he became a registered Republican or retain that than I think the New York times is obligated since it was the first reported\nThe tell us how was because Florida\nIs not allowed to clear up it's a voter rolls because of all the left wing are suing is it because um [noise] people on the ah Florida clemency board game as registration out what exactly are we going to rethink this idea that that one should be

guy but was that\nUm you know it's the first time where supporters of a particular candidate have been directly account of attacked and attacked regularly for a long term and you know and that's a thought things that people when they when they pick the five and then they're attacked by that\nAnd that that's my point is you know they're going back and forth that if the if the rhetoric between what Donald Trump that and and what the media and the Democrats say it's it's really directed to I don't ever remember Donald Trump I'm doing something to the supporters of the Democrats the way that the Democrat\nI think I think you're giving this not way too much credit CERN two thousand two he threatened to bomb a or a public utility because he was angry with a worker\nSo I'd be very very careful about playing into the less hands that this is uh some guy who who's angry about what the left is doing and so forth and so we're all angry about what the left is doing but we don't send real are fake bombs to a bunch of people\nNo I don't support that at all I was more the case of you know you're you're asking why do we push the button wackos our anyway why ever fact order in the right way to say wait a\nWhile the media like to do this they attack or all the time because you see Mr Zucker overt CNN and uh the clown that runs MSL us they they've decided that they are political

right I ... for math on an\nAlly let let let's let on you say there is a moral issue here I don't think people should be able to pay their way out of the illegal behavior\n\nAnd and watch all also sees\nBecause many of them are in very little in terms of wages and many of them get paid under the table or because the employer doesn't want to be revealed as a crook\nWhat I'm saying is I don't think this would work because it's already lawless and so you're saying okay let's tax that well if that's already lawless and they're not paying any taxes to begin with the employer and so forth then how ... how do you push them into that system\nOr something even for legal immigration coming to this\nCountry we gotta have something going in for the\nPhone while we need is to limit the number of people coming into the country legally and illegally that's it\nIs not Nineteen Eighteen twenty Eighteen it's a new ball game\nI don't know what that means I mean it's the new economy we can't way of bite the tanks\nDuring the Nineteen twenties ... presidency we had a during that period before and slightly after we had like a twenty year respite on immigration you aware of that\nI Wish it was to some extent or a matter of us being able to just slow things down assimilate people within our system to take a look at how it's shaking out in terms of our school systems terms of law enforcement terms a local health care in terms of jobs and so forth but\nWhat's happening is the left is flooding the field more and more and more we've never had a fifty year period of immigration like we have right now never in American history we actually have a political party that cheering illegality\nCheering so I I I don't but I appreciate your call people come up with tax schemes and everything else it's beyond tax games\nCheering\nSo I I I don't but I appreciate your call people come up with tax schemes and everything else it's beyond tax games it's beyond well let's have them pay three times
