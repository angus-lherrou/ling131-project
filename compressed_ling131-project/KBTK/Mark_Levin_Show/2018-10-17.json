N. A. L. go\nHey how you doing a good time caller longtime listener I'm twenty two I'm a biology student I Know a little bit ... addict I'm as you said you know it's\nSo ... and you know it's a thousand twenty fours a bit of Native American and were conservative she's like one two hundred fifty six [noise]\nNative American I mean I'm probably one thousand twenty fourth\nOf like every race that there is I like the the thing that really frustrates me as a as a young young thinking person is white cat or these politicians make their careers based on their own merit on their own talent on their own wears them or their connection with the people and how to solve issues and stuff it\nIt's pretty annoying\nGod Bless you that this is the first time you've gone through a main amen brother [laughter]\nThis is one of my my all time favorite calls quite honestly a Twenty one years of doing radio this is a moment that makes my heart saying you're twenty two you were in science and you're in Washington DC and you're making political sense how did that happen in and do you have any friends\nI have plenty of friends or where there is a small revolution uh but uh uh I have to get a lot of credit and my parents are more invested a lot of knee and not just to frustrate you need more ah the word pedigree\nIs actually like a technical term that we use\nIn genetics on it because the people don't really see the difference between our animal than people that I think so there were you pedigree for people an animal\nReminds me of a sad song you and me baby in nothing but anyway uh that amazing Josh I mean really\nA long view and spread your wisdom to as many people as possible board knows we could use it they're a great call critical All right let's go to a Peter and Illinois All right Peter I uh I it's a tough act to follow so you've got to up your game that was a pretty impressive called there\nWell when you were talking about the brain dead voters in Massachusetts you have to remember that these are the same people who after a Teddy Kennedy left a woman to drown and the bottom of Chappaquiddick reelected him six times back to the United States Senate\n[laughter] you raise a very important and interesting point in fact the only thing that he did get caught disqualified problem was a well ultimately his presidential bid at that point to add to your right if you could also going to get away with Chappaquiddick and you still get reelected in Massachusetts\nAh you know what I defer to the vet is uh that that is an excellent point which by the way that that whole thing and the and it's fascinating by the way every now and then uh because of the last name people will think that\nUh because I'm In broadcasting I Am directly related to the person who helped break that story one Roger Mudd back then and I'm not I'm not a somewhere in the very ah outer lying to a bar or a genetic silver pedigree you might say there would be a some overlap but actually\nI Am a more aligned with them for me a ... there is one\nInfamous member of the the family than I Am directly related to and that would be Dr Samuel but\nWho may be familiar was one of the uh co conspirators in the assassination of Lincoln he was a doctor actually fix the flag and ended up having a whole kind of interesting deal where you went to the door to goes and\n... that's the story for a different day but anyway that is my relation not Roger Mudd who broke Chappaquiddick which by the way it's kind of interesting people thought after that\nOh Roger must be does this Republican guys ... now\n... both signed up to this day he's still a Democrat it's just that he was doing his job and magic mad by thing actually had some people in the news business that did their job\nAnd it kind of like you know yeah yeah the Kennedy was running against a quarter of their\nCats and peanut good old friendships that was my nickname for him or in in Georgia by the way from suburban Atlanta so a nickname was always kept in being in fact one of my uh favorite parodies from many years ago was I remember the ... and ... enjoy commercials\nYou know sometimes you feel like an egg I kind of had some ... like you know sometimes you feel like and that sometimes you are one you know in the plenty of Jimmy Carter is um so you could throw in there are so anyway it's just a as an aside but yeah so that cleared the path for Jimmy Carter\nTo do win the nomination again for the Democrats and get his ... by one Ronald Reagan so that story at least was happily ever after for the country not so heavily out ever after for Massachusetts or for the United States Senate or because to your point he continued to win time after time after time\nAll right so a couple of things here\nWhen we are taking only three weeks away from election day\nThere's a lot to keep in perspective and one of the things that I Will frequently pointed out you um have hurt me anywhere along the way you you've probably heard me say things like there are two sides to stories the one side to facts tend to be pretty a\nParticular about the facts you know you don't get it's kinda like you know ... we're really not having a conversation about you being a Native American Elizabeth Warren's because while you're not\nRight so you can't you would that that would embrace a false premise which then takes me to the premise that the premise if anything is false than anything built upon it is as well\nLast friday I introduce the sliding scale of morality which means that people always wonder how is it you don't have somebody who under best day seems like a pretty good person and then several underway wow they really are awful and they're stabbing you in the back in their line\nAnd and that's because you have some people that have a moral compass that is stronger than others you know let's say that on our best day we're in eight out of a one through ten ten being perfect which none of us are well if you're an eight even on a bad day you're probably not going to be worse than the five therefore when you're at your weakest your words not going to go out of your way to hurt somebody else for your own personal benefit\nWell then you bring it to somebody like a oh I don't know\nElizabeth Warren clearly clearly under sliding scale morality one that lives with Warren\nPretty a moral person because she is willing to hurt somebody that's just that she's willing to commit fraud is that she is willing to hurt somebody for personal gain and once again not a victimless crime because somewhere\nMany times over all throughout her academic career throughout her professional career leading up to the time that she was the United states senator she took the thought of that actual Native American\nSo somebody did get hurt it's pretty moral on the sliding scale of morality that is the willingness to hurt somebody for your own personal benefit or so [noise]\nYou can justify that not bringing I Will have that conversation and we'll also talk to the Cherokee Nation as well because they have a few things to say about it\nWe'll give you the conversation on by mud in for the great one month\nHim

and sounding egotistical you should have somebody called me back and let you let me tell you my entire story but in order to cut it short\nI'm very quickly I didn't vote for Obama I uh I'm I'm totally

my\nKids I don't care who come about fifty here with my kids have to sit on a table and get into a you know a book to job abortion or God Forbid you have to round up and starting to get it again and

movie we hear everything we can go to get everything I guess bad\nBecause they knew they were coming from Burma crowded party and what they haven't even really have no family knew me\nWho they're fine and making her ... the um well I mean I'm In my eyes the as my idea is that I Believe that\nThen you are you raise a number of interesting points and it sounds like you have been very much politically and balls and they've ... over a long window of time\nYou are not a typical from a lot of likely Trump voters and even is typical because I'm not sure if they don't let the Asian between conservatives versus Republicans versus moderate it's really hard anymore with labels\nBut what I Will say and I see this a lot with especially younger Republican ask voters\nWe're basically describing is that you are a social liberal but fiscally conservative and ultimately it's how do you want your government to be run\nNow and the grand scheme of things if we're talking about the values that you just represented as Donald Trump likely to strip any of those potential rights\n... from any of the the aforementioned no ... is Donald Trump going to be the guy to to try to to push for the elimination of of gay marriage no he's not\nOr for that matter he's even told justice to stand down when it comes to marijuana enforcement you know there's he's not the most conservative guy I mean take a look at his own personal life it tells you as much so you do have a lot of fiscal conservatism I'll give you an idea you know I'm I'm a little bit of a quandary\nPolitically myself I you know don't generally talk about it quite this way but I personally am quite conservative and when it comes to social values I live my life as kind of like a half assed Catholic\nAnd I said I was a good Catholic wouldn't be true so I Want to be honest [laughter] so you know yeah I got to have as Catholic but I you know I had here too that that kind of value system for so for example you know personally I'm pro life\nBut I Believe in a libertarian form of government so when it comes to social issues I Am more inclined to get the government the way for example I don't think the government should be involved at all in marriage why is it that the government dictates marriage why is it that the tax code has ever delineated\nBased upon one marital status we've created so many issues so many issues that way\nThey didn't have to be created because we've put government into the mix\nSo I Am inclined or you know it's like with marijuana a lot of people think that uh you know because I I Will rail against it like we have you know medical marijuana legalized in Florida which a lot of states do and you have the recreational use in several more states all rail against it and and people say oh you're just hands on marijuana what no one not\nI don't care about your crap as long as you keep it away from me and don't hurt anybody my issue is that is not legal you know I I Believe again and the premise and so in the case of something like marijuana well\nIt needs to be either legalize rather minimum decriminalized by the federal government otherwise all we're doing and all these states\nLike mine is some in our nose at the United States Constitution it doesn't work that way and that's the reason that we got all this kind of horse craft stuff going on where you can use the financial system and it creates a whole host of problems under that and you have doctors that will go\nYou know given like a wink and a not because you can't actually issue of prescription because by the way you're trying to issue guidance on a schedule one drunk\nSo again that is I I think where you're coming from more of a position that is prevalent within a Trump supporter but even maybe\nEven a young younger or just the Republican ask again voters for the lack of a better label and certainly I think people who are constitutional is so anyway ah my my heart goes out to you for having been the victim best to you and your family a and may God Bless and by the way for a high camp in North Dakota\nI mean come on the high camp in North Dakota ... you're you're talking about a state that Trump won by thirty six points and her she's voted with Donald Trump approximately forty percent of the time I I mean ... doesn't exactly line up with\nThe north Dakota and values I mean I I don't know what Taylor Swift\nI'm Renee mud and for the great one month\nNo\nHave you ever thought about the word education will it means to lead for the word fourth raises another question which way is fourth how do you
