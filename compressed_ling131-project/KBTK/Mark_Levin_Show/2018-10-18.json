piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair or we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing Eucharist because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not ever call me back but\nI'm going to give you one more chance and in ... that's okay I'm going to tax the cars at twenty five percent

to you that means it's a Trump phone record of that's good or bad but that's what I mean it's a we have to\nDo well I Will say I think we're going to do very well on the Senate and a lot of things have happened since justice now justice Kevin are Fifteen jobs that are Fifteen to judge many many judges\nAnd we're going to have a hundred and forty five judges fairly soon when you think about it I mean a hundred and forty five it will be close to fifty percent of the whole judiciary not only to Supreme Court justices so\nBut that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with justice Kevin are because\nI've rarely seen a person treated so badly the man of great distinction a great life and the way they treated him was horrible and since that happened Republicans are looking so is everybody they see what's going\nOn under the law of unintended consequences because I've had many women in western Meyer Nobel I with Kevin they don't want to say publicly but if you send in a in a weird sense Kevin all as motivated the Republican face when otherwise it wouldn't have happened\nBeen a great friend of mine and I appreciate it give it a very terrific guy and so
