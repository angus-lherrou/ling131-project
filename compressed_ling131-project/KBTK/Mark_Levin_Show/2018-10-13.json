Bush doesn't like black people if we can take a look at prosperity and the unemployment rate rock above a hated black people that go with Donald Trump Donald Trump loves black people\nI mean human county that man\nHe loves them you know who else Donald Trump loves Donald Trump gloves women you know George Bush I liked woman\nWe take a look at unemployment right to go to the economy I think he liked woman rocket bomber well sure I I think I I don't they brought to Obama like women but Donald Trump Donald Trump blobs women\nI'm Still talking about the economy and unemployment rates have Brian mud or infer Margot then\nTalk about the things real quick uh this is kind of important in the context of these conversations while the media wants to make it all about how much the profanity of Kanye West what is costing you pointed out just pointed out\nThat hey you know from an economic standpoint what's most important important that people are lifted up and they have opportunity oh okay so where have we have the most opportunity for black adults\nWill shoot that Donald Trump here or all of the demographics\nThat are experiencing record low unemployment rates this year\nYes black adults women Hispanics born born adults and even Native Americans\nIn fact if we weren't going to find a girl\nThat Donald Trump doesn't like the Donald Trump doesn't love apparently Donald Trump doesn't like why people George Bush doesn't like black people but Donald Trump he doesn't like why people think about the only place will have regular what I Want to blame the rates\nRight now huh oh that happened now\nBeing that you are probably more students than the average person out there you know how the game has always been played Democrat politics or what their identity politics they're meant to divide they're meant to cause friction division their men also importantly to do what key people down\nWhat we've seen every time people get an opportunity\nWell that is an opportunity to open their mind remember was talking about just a few minutes ago sliding scale morality but also finding people who are open minded now historically we've seen well over Ninety percent\nOf black adults both for Democrats\nIt with any group of people we ever agree Ninety percent of the time but why is it that for decades how we'd had black adults that were breaking Ninety percent plus it's time for a Democrat no open mindedness no division of thought\nBuying into the identity politics\nBut nothing ever changed\nAnd we see that we're still the country where a man\nFrom the poor neighborhood in the country can go on to become the most renowned neurosurgeon in the world and by the way be part of the Trump Administration and a Republican and now we see that one of the top entertainers in the world self made near billionaire\nCan also like Donald Trump and be a Republican and that is the problem because that is where the Democrats get exposed as soon as there's an opportunity for diversity of thought and that comes through opportunity\nAnd the one thing if we take a look at George W. Bush\nAdministration at the politics of use as usual at that\nTime we didn't see the inner cities being lifted up\nWhat Donald Trump run on what did he campaigned on the inner cities weren't going to let them up\nMinority unemployment rate it's real it's happening George Bush might not have like five people but Donald Trump\nLike people telling us was Donald Trump mud ever the gray one more little bit\nHave you ever thought about the word education will it means to lead forth the word fourth raises another question which way is fourth\nThat's why it took a sea change that's why it took a catalyst it at a gang James like Donald Trump in so many different respects to break through how many good economies have we had we had a great economy in the eighties into the nineties\nWhy didn't we have record low black unemployment back then\nThe economy was good and the early part of the two thousands why didn't we have a record low black unemployment then\nBronco bomb I mean come on now well I of course open change when it was a bunch of bull crap but I mean he he cares about white people right I mean come on look at them well\nYeah he he cares about having their vote which means you need to keep 'em on government assistance keeping the economy that's mediocre keeping the economy that will not allow people to have upward mobility boom you're gone right where you need them okay so now we have Donald Trump we have record low minority unemployment rates across\nThe board and what do you see you see somebody like John Yang who obviously is not an ideologue ... not a Republican\nItaly's not traditionally somebody who thinks that George Bush doesn't like black people but somebody who loves Donald Trump you see what goes on there and you see why the media and the leftist are so scared of this man because he did what couldn't be done\nHe made a difference in acting policy they gave people a chance and that means that you create open minds that means that when you hear that wow Donald Trump's approval rating among black adults is in double digits all the sudden\nThat could be enough that could be enough let's go to Nancy in Indiana Nancy go\nHi this is Nancy from Evansville, Indiana or and I am so happy to talk to you but you talk about a moral sliding moral compass ...

wish you well I'm ... and decided to scale morality I I think you're dealing with some very amoral individuals I Would say that if we're talking on the scale of one to tend the folks that you are dealing with\nProbably starting out around the U.S away and so I don't like your chances of ever getting very far with those folks but uh hey uh you know if for now\nWe're going to try to find those folks who are at least at least you know five six is on our overall sliding scale morality which by the way if you missed it at the onset of the show kinda my theme that I'm tiny things into today\nI like to say there are two sides to stories one side the facts and you have the premise of the premise of anything is false thing the built upon it will fail to but they're also was a sliding scale of morality in similar on it\nWe exist and we'll read or best maybe we're good people when we're at our worst maybe we're not quite as good but the differences are we've somebody who will end up hurting others what we see in today's world we got a lot of folks that are willing to hurt others and we have a whole political party right now that is willing to do that as well\nYou see in today's world we got a lot of folks that are willing to hurt others and we have a whole political party right now that is willing to do that as well and a lot of that happen through misinformation don't let's talk about the employment situation again for a second record low unemployment for minorities\nBlack unemployment rate adult timeless\nAnd somewhere along the way you have Donald Trump that brings out the best and many of these minority communities you have somebody who actually sat down with Kim ... which many of us were skeptical about at the onset and something constructive came out of it\nNow you have gone yet west who goes into the oval office and\nSomething constructive might come out of it\nBut more to the point the more open minds we have in this country the better the employment picture or minorities the more opportunity not only politically that comes with it\nBut the better the opportunity for the entire country open minds\nEqual better opportunities and a better chance for a more moral nation because if we adhered to pull politics and the people that start out on that sliding scale of morality from a really negative place\nWhere are we going to be taken for the people who wanted to believe for example Christine Ford and Chuck Schumer who said he believes her Dianne Feinstein who believes her people believe them\nSo you have people that started out and that fighting scale morality and an amoral place and have taken their politics and those folks left with them\nThat's not good Donald Trump taking hold minority communities including black adult women Hispanics\nEven Native Americans to new heights economically that they had never seen before that's the jade and change it and that's the difference and that's the irony of Donald Trump who in his own personal life maybe not the most moral man fine and the grand scheme of that sliding scale morality\nOne politician has kept more promises inside of two years then that man that always told me that there are two kinds of people you got people who will tell you something and you can't believe it and you got people who will tell you something and you can take it to the bank\nWhen Donald Trump says

[laughter]\nOh there you go I mean guy coming soon\nSarah Huckabee Sanders meets Kanye West\nTalking about the entertaining exchanges have you heard the\nPresident he said he could talk for many time what do you want the bad but there is a certain amount of empowerment the gun you feels I mean like ... as the president said he is smart cookie [laughter] [laughter]\nYou can also see him going you know what the president said I can speak for 'em any time\nThat that could be entertaining and has a ... we'll see where that story is now a a story that I\nCan't believe it is still being discussed one that has been long perpetuated as a fraud not as significant as the Medicare fraud the Medicare for all idea that we were just talking about but the minimum wage\nThe the greatest fraud perpetuated over decades of time has been the need for the minimum wage to be maintained by your federal government now recently we had the Amazon dot com increase to Fifteen dollars per hour which in it of itself and don't get me wrong\nAmazon they built a better mouse trap but I mean the ... so you want to talk about the Packers the on the left and it was no bounds remember a while it's about a time\nWal Mart was the greatest have pool in the country because they were coming to your neighborhood and and killing ... they were taking them out there taking their businesses and then they were putting a bunch of people on yes minimum wage right a plus\nA Walmart here from uh from\nRepublican place aren't they yeah there are those people so I mean for all those reasons I mean Walmart which is a evil\nBut here you go you've got a you've got Amazon dot com they happen to be greater than three times the size of Wal Mart yes yes the Amazon is three hundred percent the size and market capitalization of Walmart and loved by the left\nBut again you know I I think a big rush them nothing to happen to be a capitalist they built the better mouse trap but anyway I digress whoever's on goes to Fifteen dollars per hour and then you hear the the post go\nEverybody should take Amazon model now I Will point out some of the obvious here\nFor people to understand economics there are many other businesses that operate in retail which happens to be a little more to business there were getting crushed by Amazon ironically enough are going to have a harder time increasing wages because Amazon at their size scale and an ability to deliver the way they're delivering\n[laughter] they they are killing the profits or take a look at any number of you'll retail companies that you grew up with that are dead and dying as we speak now\nThan I was standing\nThe number of people that actually earned minimum wage I went back and actually check my research on this and\nIronically enough to last time it was a really big issue it kinda like coming off the Occupy crowd in the twenty fourteen mid term elections I happen to be about four years ago that we had the the big minimum wage conversation and hey you know what\nA lot of folks in the country had a point because they did kind of ... you know for eight years of Obama we average one point eight percent economic growth we never even got close to an average US Economy so yeah okay but\nEven then what percentage of people earned\nMinimum wage got number in your head\nHow many people back in twenty fourteen you'd think earned minimum wage ready one point eight percent even ... Obama's economy it was only one point eight percent what's more as the average age of somebody who earned minimum wage happened to be twenty two and a half but it'd be working part time\nJob I mean you know that the people that were heads of households that were you know trying to raise a family and uh you know they needed a living wage right\nBut that was that and we've got the best economy in a generation we've got the lowest unemployment rate in forty nine years weve got record low unemployment rates for everybody but pretty much why the white people\nAnd how many people actually earned the minimum wage you're ready according to the bureau of Labor Statistics\nPoint six percent point six percent that zero zero point six percent now what's more is that Ninety nine percent\nOf those people be point six percent are under the age of twenty five and what happened\nAs soon as Amazon raise those wages we got the\nConversation come up again oh one of the great rods perpetuated that's out there the living wage is funny what actually happened a good economy economics Amazon dot com props prospering and they had the financial wherewithal to be able to increase wages\nJust like what we're seeing because here's another little factoid oh by the way\nWhen you take a look at the average amount of money that a person's banking not only are we finally\nJust about a three percent towards a wage growth by the time you add in bonuses goes over that by the time you add in your tax cut churns out to be about another Eighteen hundred bucks for the average person working this year is what\nThe average net take home pay now a six point seven percent year over year you have to go back thirty two years to find the last time your income growth\nThat good so the living wage\nFunny what happens when you actually have a good economy weights and the minimum wage\nAnd I was just a bunch of BS killing Medicare for all\nTwo sides to stories one set of facts will continue to do a lot more of the factual stuff right here I Am ... and for the great one mark a little bit [noise]\nEvery time you go on line your Internet provider an advertising\nTax cuts savings has gone to a combination of bonuses and employee raises thirty five percent twenty percent has gone to a debt reduction which makes sense we've seen interest rates rise companies that have dead they should paid off that helps the company become more stable essence their debt burden with rates rising\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrading software five percent upgrading ... uh upgrading equipment and five percent have increased evidence so all in the combination of share about buybacks in dividend payouts twenty percent at that\nAnd even then you probably benefit because once again something that is not perpetuated information only by our friends and media generally\nFifty two percent of Americans own socks and by the way despite the volatility of the past few days way with the greatest wealth creation machine the history of the world is your United States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the biggest beneficiary\nIs you employ but [noise] you know\nI I guess conveniently that that message has just been missed you know I Am sure that any day now it's going to be a big story that will be recorded on\nAnd again CNBC they're the ones with that story interesting how even NBC when other news outlets hasn't decided to actually run with their own story from their own CFO council\nOne of these days I'm sure it's just over say All right let's go to Ross in South Dakota Russ go\nProbably doing all good well\nI see it as kind of a two court problem really I mean you get a single payer healthcare system and you're going to basically just keep these big hospitals in ... the smaller ones they're not going to survive you know they're not going to make the money that these bigger wants to make it I'll be because they can't cut the cost\nThe government wants to cut them down to for a lot of this stuff that's the first part I see the second part I see is we need to adjust something in the hospitals you know what it costs to manufacture up one thousand cc bag of IV fluids\nI Would think not much I'm guessing you know\nA dollar I I did the research for my call just to make sure I had the numbers right and you know what they charge you for it in the hospital and a lot more memory hundred dollars\nAnd and so Ross and I appreciate the call and you have a ... a good point but a couple of things in it that we should discuss when we're talking about insurance generally\nThe biggest problem and affordability and health care is health insurance\nThe problem is we have been raised the idea that health insurance equals healthcare\nThat's not the case one of the more remarkable statistics in the wake of Obamacare has been the lack of people that could afford health care with health insurance\nIs was according to the Kaiser Family foundation hardly a conservative organization they still to this day are proponents of Obamacare I mean after all the kind of have a vested interests\nBut here's what they found in their research there are forty two million Americans forty two million that have health insurance they can't afford healthcare you think about that for a moment\nThe average health insurance plan eighty five hundred dollars now if you don't pay all that it might be because your employer sponsoring it but that's the only the average cost of health insurance right now\nSo would you be better off\nIf you had eighty five hundred dollars but you could use on health care\nOr would you be better off if eighty five hundred dollars with for health insurance and then after that you got to see how much you had to pay out of pocket before you hit the deductible which often happens to be a high deductible plans which state and you can't hit which is why people can't afford healthcare\nIt's all part of the financial fraud\nSo the number one way to get to more affordable health care is to break the back of the insurance first model having embrace it was the first thing that we did that was a big time mistake\nOnce you do that you are going to get to the crux of what you were talking about there which is consumer price transparency the most back crap crazy thing I have ever seen in my life\nIs walking into a medical facility being handed a piece of paper that says and so many words that whatever happens in that facility\nWhich you have no clue generally yet what that's going to be in whatever it happens to cost which they generally can't even tell you\nAnd whatever your insurance company doesn't pay for which they also can't tell you you'll pay for how\nIs that you will Magid walking into a store build a car with stuff not having a clue what any of it costs and signing the piece of paper that says some point later we're going to tell you how much you're going to pay us for this and that is bad\nCrazy but that's what we have with our insurance first model right now so you break the ...\nThey are going to tell you how much you're going to pay us for this and that is bad\nCrazy but that's what we have with our insurance first model right now\nSo you break the back of it we get to weigh the way we use the shirts for everything else in her life how was that well what we do if we have no mechanical problem with our car well we we do pay and have it fixed\nIf we get in a big gun accident we found this year it's like we're already at the point with health insurance to where it's essentially catastrophic care for tens of millions of Americans right can't afford to use health care the rest of the time\nOkay so why don't we go to that place to where we use health insurance as a catastrophic plan which by the way is what the president's new plans the ones that are called skinny badlands and but the Democrats are are sitting there you know what I'm saying it's the worst thing that's essentially what they are catastrophic care\nWhich is cheaper and better for people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to use the other more expensive policies anyway\nBut at that point you're able to do what you're able to be a consumer we are incredibly good consumers when we have an opportunity to shop oh we got on the best deal in the world on TV or whatever else it is will sit there and we'll take a look at best deal boom done\nWell with health care we never have a shot we never have a shot at doing it on the things I Do somewhat routinely I'll take like anytime we have research that will show the cost of a procedure from one place to the next\n... I had a I had a minor surgery years ago that had I gone through my insurance would have cost a thousand bucks\nDecided to shop around\nPay cash and it was five hundred dollars to the point there\nWe never know because we signed pieces of paper those ads something's gonna happen here and we'll pay for whatever the insurance company doesn't so they be if you really want to get to the crux of it not only is Medicare for all financial fraud but frankly the\nBiggest lie of Obamacare is not the you know I mean it's gotta be cheaper and you can keep your doctor and all that\nIs that insurance equals healthcare insurance doesn't equal healthcare insurance is the ... of healthcare for tens of millions of Americans well could say the conversation coming up next I'm Brian mud and for the great one month\n\nAsk any a Mac remember what they like most about belonging to the conservative alternative to A.
