really is a privilege and I say that and I truly mean if they have Rhonda scientists\nThe Republican running for governor of Florida on this program I've been a fan of his since the day was elected I watched him work in the house of representatives he is solid he has enormous integrity he's a he's an Iraq vet is a very smart guy graduated from Harvard and he's so smart and um\nAnd he's taken the lead on so many issues that are important to this country Rhonda scientists how are you my friend\nI'm doing great mark how're you doing\nI'm doing fine you know I watched this debate last night with your opponent Gillum and I got to say this before we get into substance\nRick how're you doing I'm doing fine you know I watched the debate last night with your opponent Gillum and I got to say this\nBefore we get into substance he is a very nasty guy I mean the he he turns to you and he must have called you a liar twenty times uh he uh he just said some incredibly snarky things and I thought to myself\nThis guy's cocky he thinks that he has it in the bag and I suspect he does not mean and what did you make of the debate\n... book I think I think that whole performance was really beneficial for me I mean you know when you're running for governor mark obviously\nYou know voters are going to look to see you know do they agree with it or not and so I'm somebody who is running on keeping Florida low tax aid he wants to massive tax\n... he's running saying that we should abolish ice and so there are different obviously a huge policy differences but\nAnd the governor's race of instead of like a Senate or house race it's more than just about your position because about leadership and who could actually do the job and I think his antics\nJust showed that he's not somebody that would be a good governor even apart from his radical left wing ideology so I think his whole performance backfired I think a lot of people that didn't work that may or may obviously now get a sense of my biography my service of the country um and I just think that they\nAre the easy decisions that I'm just a better leader than go on\nOne of the things and it's very very troubling to me knowing you now for several years\nYou lead the fight in the house of representatives to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nWhen nobody thought it would go anywhere you lead the fight in the house of representatives pressing for moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem you succeeded along with the president along with are are wonderful ambassador Freeman and so forth\nAnd then for him and his party to suggest that you're supported by neo Nazis when in fact you are the biggest voice for the state of Israel in the United States House of representatives my jaw hit the floor\nWhile I I think it was so ridiculous that I didn't vote or just just\nAbout all I mean give me a break and this was from a guy who actually opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and he's been endorsed by\nThis radical left wing group dream defenders but he actually signed a pledge to the group\nSaying he would support this radical manifesto they um and this group dream defenders wanted there remains a things\nIs boycotting Israel vps they say Israel's a genocidal apartheid state so that's the group stance with he will not just of Elvis group that is who he is\nAnd I'm actually just today there was a group of we have thirty eight sheriff's\nIn Florida right give them a letter asking him to get some garbage or you can get from ... because ah the pledge that Gillum signed\nA set that police and prisons have no place in justice they want to abolish are basically traditional law enforcement get funded and then spend the money on welfare programs with very radical stuff it's dripping with hatred for men and women are in law enforcement\nAnd it's just totally unacceptable and go I'm he will not budge may be restricted by God and\nAnd that's just unacceptable cross or yeah for him to say that I I think\nIt was um I think it was a total for hours and that's the thing voters are sicker\nPeople on the left or just lashing out like that folks and and I think it really backfired big car [noise]\nYou know when you sign a petition you know you're putting your signature to it so there's no confusion any signs of petition in favor of boycotting Israel he signed a petition in favor of moving police officers out of prison and\nMore than that as you pointed out but I don't think the moderator quite comprehended what you were saying\nYou're talking about he says abolish ice and move it under the Justice Department I don't know how that changes anything moving ice from one a building to another building as somebody who served as chief of staff to the attorney general his problem is he rejects law enforcement\nAnd your point was this once a criminal alien served time in a state prison in Florida\nThe doors open and they are either turned over to the feds who deport them or they come into your neighborhood and he supports that person going into your neighborhood and not being deported isn't that basically his position\nYeah I asked them on Sunday night's debate of CNN will you honor\nA dictator request they're called ... when the federal government wants to take a criminal illegals coming out a program where you want to detain requests from Donald Trump's ice agency he would not say he would do bottom so if he's going to say oh I don't want criminals on the street with a ... moderate keep\nQuiet block to cooperate with ice and this idea of it all he wants to do is move with under the Justice Department\nMark you know about him trying to backtrack office position you know where he was running ads in the primary thing abolish I because they want open borders that's what the far left one\nAnd he was playing to the bay so the idea that all he wants to do with like administrative tweak or he's lying when he says that he wants to abolish the agency because he doesn't want immigration enforcement\n[noise] now when we come back after the bottom of the hour run to scientists by the way what is your website Ron\nRon ... dot com\nOr we're going to put it up on my social sites ladies and gentlemen runs being big time outspent this guy Soros behind them you've got Styron behind them all the left wing billionaires and left wing groups they're targeting Florida they know if they take Florida it's going to be very difficult to win the presidency in the future and again behind a true\nBernie Sanders George Soros people for the American way which is so he works for radical\nWhen we come back I Want to ask Ron to censor certain FBI investigation that's been taking place in Tallahassee where this guy was mayor and Mr Guillen connection to it and there is a connection to it will be right back [noise]\n\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel who owe the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the IRS they didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual her and how much I respect optimal tax relief\nAnd his attorney wrote a cease and desist letter to the station and then the letter of the attorney said a public reports have said that Andrew is not the subject\nOf the investigation but as you know mark some of these bugs words you can be a subject of an investigation you can also be a target of the investigation his own campaign attorney\nDid not put it in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said Andrew is not a subject so that to me is is a is an interesting er mission or because the bottom line is\nWhy would they be investigating corruption in city hall if it had nothing to do with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agents around him on these trips like they run\nAnd run to send to see immediately tried to racialized position that the reason you were bringing it up for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nNow last time I checked it has nothing to do with somebody's race when there's an undercover agent giving somebody I'm a value to try and see if they'll take it any Chuck it has nothing to do with race and I notice he tried to do this over and over and over again in this campaign let me ask you a question your running mate who is your running mate\nOh her name is Jeanette noon yeah she's a state representative from Miami\nShe's a Cuban American\nCuban American and and when we get elected she'll be the highest ranking a female Hispanic and the history of Florida government\nMhm I noticed the media doesn't talk much about that\nNow of course not but I'll tell you with\nAndrew lashing out like this I mean\nWhen you start talking about corruption people understand about black or white it's about right versus wrong and if you're using this off as to whether you're a mess like dams or did they matched the problem it's interesting mark there wasn't just the\nThe illegal stuff that he died when he was on the ... city commission or he did vote to raise property taxes on people but he also\nVoted to increase his own retirement benefits by tens of thousands of dollars basically doubling it's hey\nAll right so he wanted A People's Tallahassee to pay more and he wanted somebody has to go directly into his pocket so he's always been a self dealing politician or whether elite whether it's legal votes like that which are corrupt anyway or illegal activity like accepting the Hamilton ticket and turning around and given these guys the deal they want it\nAnd he worked for this group people for American way is that correct\nYeah and here's the thing about that that's a very ultra liberal groups so if you look at people for the American way filing they say they pay Andrew Gillum this is while he was mayor a hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year to work forty hours a week\nWell the mayor of Tallahassee is a fulltime job so how how was he working forty hours a week for people for the American way so one of\nTwo things are true either he is actually doing that in which case heat than collecting the people of Tallahassee which may explain why they had the highest number of murders and the history of the city last year and have one of the most part they have the highest crime rate in Florida\nOr he ain't working forty hours a week and that's all just a fraud and he basically accepting money without performing services so what are the other uh is problematic no matter which way you\nKnow I'm a little confused when I met the nation is in the Floridians are too you can be mayor and have a side job with a group like people for the American way founded by Norman Lear at a Hollywood entered a hundred and forty thousand dollars on the side\nWell yeah and I think that the question is their\nPeople for the American way said that was in exchange for him working forty hours a week I think he probably wasn't doing forty hours a week I think they were just trying to funnel money to them but if he was working forty hours a week to them\nHow does that make the people tell me feel you know they have the just out of control crime problem he's raising taxes he's doing all these gangs\nAnd yet he's working for the left wing group so it's a problem either right but it's interesting even though the documents are out there um journalists do not pursue got at all I mean if I if I Walk on the wrong side of the sidewalk you know they tried to do a\nDo different stories on me so it's definitely a double standard I mean it's an obvious question that would really that should be investigated by the press\nAnd when they hit to other things before you go and then is health care in Texas\nHe uh has talked about Medicare for all this is the big left wing push Medicare for all and it's been pointed out Medicare for all means everyone on Medicare loses Medicare\nEveryone when they don't employer private employer health care plan loses their private employer health care plan every union member who's union is negotiated a health care plan they will lose their health care plan\nEverybody will lose the health care that they have now\nWith some theories some strength and some concoction they'll create were Washington DC will have the scientists to system whether you like it or not whenever you have today disappears and what does this response to this and he would eliminate all existing health care plans for everybody that's on them including Medicare\nOne little correction market it eliminates I think for about three hundred million people the two things that Bernie has built keeps\nOr the VA in the Indian Health service so now I guess that means that all that Elizabeth Warren has a one one thousand percent her health care if they do this but bottom line is right so\nHis response is when I called them out on this was basically to act like he didn't know what I was talking about he was running commercials saying single payer health Medicare for all two months ago but he realizes that that is toxic and Florida because we have senior citizens\nWho have their arrangements they'd been and then the Medicare Medicare Advantage program we have obviously millions of people who earn their health benefits through their employer\nBeen and then the Medicare Medicare Advantage program we have obviously millions of people who earn their health benefits through their employer through their employment\nAnd he would take all of that way you have no choice you get dumped just as you said dumped on a single payer which we know\nWill cause a tax increase it it will bankrupt or it'll hemorrhage money and so they'll have to ration it so yeah you may have the right to have all this great stuff but you're not going to find a doctor it's got to be able to perform that there'll be waiting lines and we know the drill and all that so that is not popular once people know\nAbout what it is and so basically he just tried to run away from it as much as he can um even on the primary he with gang that got the way to get your when we're in Florida so we're going to keep reminding voters\nThat talk about let me talk about let's hit taxes now I mean one one of the reasons a lot of people come to Florida from these blue states as you don't have an income tax\nAnd that's also one of the reasons you have such a dynamic economy in such a diverse economy in Florida and I have a home in Florida so I've seen I've seen the difference between a no tax income tax state and I have a home and I my primary residence in Virginia and an income tax state\nI cannot believe with all the proposals he's making is I've never supported a state income tax\nThat's what these guys do I saw it in Connecticut years ago and so forth so I'm not an favorite and then they push and push the spending and the debt and then either they push for an income tax or some court orders and income taxes supports an income tax and in truth Disney\nSo there was a study done a nonpartisan study that analyzes all his spending proposals and the conclusion of the study was in order to make it work he would either need to do one or two things have a state wide sales tax\nOf thirty eight percent or impose a state income tax which could reach as high as thirty five percent so those are the only two realistic routes or he would be able to pay for because you know he wants to pay for single payer health care he wants to pay for free college he wants to do all this other stuff\nAnd that's what it would cost so you go down that road a Florida is done economically I mean it would totally critical our economy and critical our state and we obviously can't let that happen um at all\n[noise] Fifteen dollar minimum wage Seattle tried it it's been a complete failure\nAll the cities at try it or what they wind up doing is the the the people who are earning minimum wage or low wages they're the ones who were punished\nBecause what happens is people get fired small restaurants can't afford it even changed can't afford it and so the price of food goes up less people go into these outlets and go into these places and people lose jobs they lose temps\nI mean this doesn't help people actually mandating at Fifteen dollar minimum wage when it has this consequences doesn't\nSo mark I started off blue collar kid I had to work forty hours a week before I got to college I work all these jobs for six bucks an hour through college I wouldn't have been able to get through without that and it killed his policies were in place I Would not have made Fifteen an hour I Would have made zero\nBecause I Would not have had the opportunity for any of those jobs and so what he will do is he will cut hundreds of thousands of people out of work he will cause businesses to shut down businesses to leave the state um but here's the thing markets Seattle thing you mentioned a lot of the people who who who kept their jobs and they get a pay increase the Fifteen\nThey still ended up with less take home pay because their hours got ready to buy the business\nSo it's really been counterproductive and all the evidence points that way but yet he ... he doesn't care and that's what he's running\nParticularly a harmful to young people are trying to get their first job particularly harmful in minority communities people trying to get their first job same with his open borders policies that particularly harms another skilled or low skilled the unskilled or low skilled individuals\nBut uh he claims to represent these people but his policies crush these people run dissent is\nOnce again what is your site America we have all of in search let's give all the support we can to ... in Florida let's increases ground game there and the grassroots there where do people go if they want to help you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city":
