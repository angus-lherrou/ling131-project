thinking of the folks who uh stepped up in a surprise\nVisit wake Lindsey Graham at the Atlantic given in D.C on Wednesday we'll blow yourself after is funny because here you had Cory Booker ... and and he told us he was having his Spartacus moment\nAnd then Lindsey Graham like actually was part of gives up the hearing and he's continued it's kind of like what does he grams like the grandson of difference and you know the Grinch his heart grew three ... three times a day let's say that a Lindsey Graham's intestinal fortitude grew three times\nOver the past three months I Believe and so he's become a new hero in this entire process rock solid Lindsey Graham something else that I don't think many of us necessarily thought would be the case\nA couple of things I Am very much based on information or the arguments the information I provide you my opinions all based on information and one of the things I've been tracking from the word go the day after Brett Kavanaugh was\nNominated to the United States Supreme court\nGallup has always tracked on Supreme Court nominees and you may be a boon whatever about Gallup but regardless of what you think of their polling it's instructive because if they do it every single day ongoing you can use a baseline to get a temperature ... temperature jak of public opinion on any given issue in this case\nOur views the Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat was interesting and the very first polling done\nOn Brett Kavanaugh after his nomination by President Trump we had four percent more Americans\nSay that he should be confirmed an okay so that's the baseline that's where we started now after we had the first hearing\nAnd we had twenty senators on the Senate Judiciary committee and Spartacus do what they did\nComing out of that four percent more Americans thought that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed and not in other words despite the fact that a couple of months went by despite the fact that they uh you know what sport gets on them it didn't change public opinion at all not at all\nNow is interesting because as consistent as that was we did see with Christine for delegations a bit of a shift\nAs a Thursday morning not yesterday but a week ago the morning of the hearing we did see public sentiment according to Gallup shift into negative territory on Brett Kavanaugh\nWe saw what was going to make shift to three percent more people believing that he should not be confirmed then should be getting prior to the testimony alright that's after everything that the media and the politicians did to Brett Kavanaugh\nWhere are we today that's kind of interesting by a forty six forty five margin Americans believe that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed\nNow there too and that seems to be learned in this entire process on this information to first as public opinion despite all the emotions oh the emotions the all the nonsense we're Spartacus across the board to gang raping\nWhatever public opinion only shifted by seven percent seven percent top to bottom that's it in terms of the opinion about that\nNow what's instructive inside of that seven percent we bounce back to pretty much where this country is one of the things I find fascinating is when we actually do have representatives in this country that represent us and in this particular case the United States Senate\nIs doing pretty much what the American people want to have happen near\nBy a slim margin wrecked Kavanaugh\nEnded up receiving the necessary votes to advance the final vote tomorrow and we'll end up becoming the next Supreme Court justice on the narrow vote just as the American people wanted it so that part I think is so I could graphically interesting\nThe next facet of this conversation is where the focus your energy\nBecause how many people are really persuadable politically one of the most common questions I ever receive has to do with persuading people politically how do you do it\nWell the easiest way to tell you how not to do it who is it that you are most likely to engage politically\nProbably the loudest people in your life that oppose you right how's that worked out for you and let me ask you for the angry leftist but you argue politics with you ever get anywhere you just get angry do you think they're one of the\nFolks just pour that seven percent that was ever persuadable in the first place now I Know we wish that we could change their minds especially if they are in our lives and our universe\nBut he wants to be open minded first\nAnd coming up next to talk about that in hell to be persuasive and who can be persuaded and how not to bend your head against the wall and just become really unhappy [noise] I Am Brian mug\nThe great one more global [noise]\nListen to what David ask from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk and how much time and I have throughout the day and I was able to get a lot more work done ... absolutely\nAnd then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get opportunity and so it made sense to them yeah you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change you know Obama probably made sense because hey that was one or teachers told us in here we are and things are working\nThey had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it right now is one of the most important windows of time\nWe have two really good opportunities to reach people\nEspecially younger adults that now do have opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me right they're getting the wage growth the bonuses it's all happening and it's important to tell them how we got here\nAnd then it's also important in this Kevin situation to articulate what's on the line here hey if somebody that you didn't even know came out and accused you of say sexual assault may not be awful right\nYeah it'd be pretty bad right I mean that's what happened here and and go through information only rather than just the emotions of yeah you know having all the anyway just a little food for thought let's go to Archie in Ventura, California Archie go\nRight and it's it's good to hear about your ah your history and and your experience so that tells me why work with a choice you to do is show\nSpeak well of you and I wanted to say that uh I live in very carefully to the who is in a a a colon senator Collins is a [noise] a dissertation about what happened and even though I'm a Democrat and I'm In California I was a quite impressed by it he laid it out very precisely\nHe was a very methodical started out a little weak but it went on from there and build the was diligent or do I get all of the time she had been getting a\nComing to her a conclusion interview he did and all all the meetings he went to and so I found it very it applying and informative and uh her stock went up ... hundred percent with me\nI couldn't agree more I was frankly shocked at just how detailed top to bottom on every single consideration that's part of this process I mean she\nWas on ...\nAnd point by point by point from the nomination process pointing out how many organizations were going to oppose\nRegardless of who the nominee was that one of the organizations hadn't even filled in the name and they put out that they were opposing the nominee mentioned or that even senators got out ahead to one of them even got out ahead of the name being announced when they were saying that they were opposed\nAll the way through\nPoint by point by point\nWind Christine Ford was not credible in terms of the allegations even though she did mention that she believed that ultimately she was likely a sexual assault victims no evidence whatsoever that it was Brett Kavanaugh and her eyes she could have been the top attorney in the country the way that she laid out\nThe details as she found them\nIt was about Fifteen minutes fifty fifty five minutes her speech and I would say that it is a must to view if you missed it uh it is definitely worth catching the entire thing it was captivating and again I have never heard\nA senator deliver a better speech not ever\nI didn't agree with absolutely everything she said but it was principles it was details it was well thought out and almost everything there was inarguable I just absolutely remarkable Susan Collins\nWho goes to ... go to Jim Jim in Charlotte welcome to the show\nBut I think so that's what it at a pretty much echo what the last caller so to go about my respect and admiration for senator callers I mean it's increased by whatever food afterward gr ogre for about ... to that I knew her vote was going to be your your your um ... I was thinking of driving down the road that you know\nThe only other thing bigger than what Susan causes did a today was when the twentieth main author Joshua ... protected the ... your your army Gettysburg little round top costs preserving the union so I really admire her and I'm Glad she did what you did\nWell that's a pretty big moment in history and I I agree that this is one for the history books as well by the way a how are the folks in North Carolina do and you guys are making the back\nOh yeah yeah the skaters are kind of a rapper and big but a a sort of cold weather gets in on her I think er I think they should be like diminishing a little bit\nHow the folks over in Wilmington a Robert Charlotte\nBut uh I was in the car racing for over ... over ... pretty good they're recovering pretty good but Jacksonville you or your real those areas where all the water are seated in the cover of area so I talked to a friend over their running back ... slowly but surely like normal\nAnd appreciate your service thank you for listening to and sharing your thoughts as well may God Bless you know the folks there I Lived in Wilmington for a very short time than when I saw what was going on and heard that it was an island a pretty unimaginable so glad that ah folks starting to get back together after the hurricane in North Carolina All right let's go to\nJake Jake's in California Welcome to the show\nHi hey uh yeah I was a I Would agree with your point about work it up says and Ford and as far as their allegations that concern but I had a little different take on a not so much to go after her but\nTo ah go after anybody in the future that might think that they can pick people up to put a a false allegations and not have to pay a price\nI think that's the single most important\nAre willing to just give a pass even though Kavanaugh is going to clear this thing\nBecause he's always going to have disdain that he's going to have to deal with there's a certain percentage of the population that's not insignificant but it's going to believe the allegation regardless and it's not okay to perjure yourself these are principal\nAnd again you know if we're going to deal with the rule of law for going to deal with the premise that should be addressed and we know because of politics we're not going to the Senate Judiciary committee pursue her for perjury\nConduct the investigation that would be necessary to travel down that path\nBut it doesn't mean that it should go and check what she did was absolutely wrong because again when you say you I'm One hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted me and you have none of your uh none of your witness a\nWhere none of the witnesses period that cooperate any of that information I mean that's a problem that's not acceptable in this country appreciate you are you listening and and checking in coming up we'll continue the conversation and also share some of\nMy final thoughts on Brett Kavanaugh on the situation as we get ready for the vote are now under a day away will be approximately five o'clock\nEastern time tomorrow because at once again this whole process has been much bigger than Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court it's become about all of us will talk about it next time by mud in for the great one month\n... ...\n... we spend most of our time

I. O. D. in Miami and always an honor and a pleasure to be here with you know one of the things about Susan Collins during the course of her dissertation\nYou might have found some moments where you're wondering huh expert cabinet are really the conservative I thought he was the really the constitutional it's I I thought he was not so sure I mean that was held good her depiction of Brett Kavanaugh was health thorough investigation was\nAll the folks she interviewed I mean she laid it all out there just remarkable and uh you know in mind raise some some questions about how he would end up really not things like say\nFor life matters\nAnd there is an important point within the pro life conversation here as well\nBrett Kavanaugh pretty evident being the\nCatholic Boy that he is he's pro life right but does that necessarily mean that he brings that philosophy to the bench and doesn't doesn't necessarily it has it as she pointed out\nWhat he has rolled on and stated previously\nAnd when we're traveling down this process you're learning things that you never would have otherwise known about Brett or about\nThe level of the investigation that took place with Susan but also what obviously was not done by so many other senators and this is where it's instructive\nFor you with the folks that are in your neck of the woods your senators how did they vote on here in Florida Marco Rubio ... voted in favor of ending debate today will vote for Brett Kavanaugh's tomorrow got Bill Nelson he voted no\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you read the book and want to get it published these publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and Brazil on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets\nThey handle all aspects of the publishing process for you bringing ... publicity copyright and editing go eat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine now where you're free author service you get that seat hunger advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author ... should get again eight hundred bonds or one thirty six eighty nine\nOr you or someone you love one of the nearly one million Americans living with Parkinson's disease there is no known cure\nThat you have the power to help change that I've read dissipating in a clinical trial the Michael J.

doesn't want to be a part of that movement is all I'm saying [noise] God [noise] and those are the kind of people\nThat you ought to be spending some quality time with a man what your doubts having a life today that was going on the uh paid protesters there a\nHeckling a and harassing Joe Manchin who is that yes Joe Manchin the Republican and waiting I Wonder if that is going to happen to have no idea but there Joe Manchin of course has been the most moderate Democrat in the Senate mentioned after the twenty sixteen election but he would consider consider the party but\nThe governor the Democratic governor of West Virginia ... so the question is uh is mentioned that maybe he wins reelection ear in any goes at an end of the ... thing but uh so I was mentioning in the previous segment\nThat there's the potential that we could be an inflection point in American history one in which the norms by Donald Trump being president of the United states not your typical president and the movement that he learned twenty sixteen not your typical movement which has happened with Brett Kavanaugh\nThat could certainly aid the argument that we're in this inflection point that things are different this is not your typical midterm election cycle to provide a little more\nFuel for that fire if you want to embrace it so bad I never said and again I'm a student of history and I'm a student of information and uh\nAnd in the Nineteen thirties so we have information about what we've been interested in what we've been into their mid term elections since the late Nineteen thirties right\nNever once not ever has the most important issue to the average voter ... in the United States Supreme court it's come up really high in presidential elections it was the number three issue on election day or three issue and election day twenty sixteen\nHis number one number one right now\nAccording to the Pew Research center Seventy six percent of Americans say that the Supreme Court will be on their mind\nWhen they get a vote however their impassioned do vote now\nWe are still just over a month away from election day\nPeople are fickle things can change Kavanaugh gets confirmed tomorrow maybe the level of priority comes down because it's been taken off the table I guess we can say or maybe people are still that motivated by because hey we got to have other Supreme Court justices that come up your over the next couple of years right\nThat remains to be saying\nBut we are seeing right now and some of the internal data that's available\nWhat's driving us that's different than ever before you have the Supreme Court and mentioned and then it goes to health care OK so after that which by the way does that change the dynamic at all\nSo we're in this window of time that is different and anytime that politics that people are different the outcomes absolutely has the potential to be too so as we are now just over a month away from election day\nYou take a look at how many elections are out there\nThat could have the outcomes changed by seven percent seven percent\nAnd that is the potential for what could happen if there were a red wave that came out of this\nRight now if you had seven percent that moved because of President Trump because of the economy because of the progress or maybe because they are tired of what's going on in this country because of backlash about Brett Kavanaugh eagle wind seven percent\nIn the first hour I mentioned that in this entire Kavanaugh process entire process from the day after he was nominated until today\nSeven percent movement top to bottom in terms of public opinion on whether or not we should confirm Brett Kavanaugh that that is really what we're looking at here those are the people that are persuadable but seven percent\nEncompasses a bunch of elections across this country usually voter enthusiasm is exaggerated because only sixty four percent of eligible adults or even registered to vote in the first place and when you take a mid term elections well I mean typically have around forty percent they actually show up to vote\nSo we do tend to often bake a bit too much into butter enthusiasm this and that\nBut it absolutely has the potential in this type of environment to make the difference which is why it's absolutely critical you want to make a difference you get your butt out there and vote but you find those seven percent\nYou use this potential inflection point in American history and you get out there and you're trying to make a difference because we do have a different landscape it's not all they are in the polling and the end the top level numbers that are discussed yet\nBut it has the potential to be and we're a little more than a month away so that is what you are in store for you get out there make a difference if you're inclined unlike those\nAngry people that were paid and and shouting that Joe Manchin it's going to win the hearts and minds at least I don't think it's going to winning hearts and minds there is this window of opportunity a moment in time potential inflection point issues that matter more that never met her before in mid term election cycles so what are you going to do with it\nAnd the other way want to give you a heads up on something that uh you definitely definitely should go ahead and ... on your\nDVR if you don't already haven't life liberty and lived in ... in eastern Fox News channel Sunday night\nGoing to talk about the media and one of my all time face best in the business my opinion Mollie Hemingway from the federal is just
