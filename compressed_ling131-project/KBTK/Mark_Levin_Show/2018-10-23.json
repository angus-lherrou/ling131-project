California the great cast ... go\nYeah uh yeah I I on the whole ... thing and drop right I'm really disturb the surveys that ah you know Trump throughout it right has a very ... it's an investigation number one number two I have repeatedly defended the Saudi rulers throughout it\nOkay hey buddy and leaning on our on our own intelligence you know it's\nLike a farce of all what you're saying is dishonest he said over\nAnd over again he wants to know the facts this was a moving target that's the way it is he wants to know the information he wants to know the ... you see I'm like you and I'm like these cheap shot reporters and commentators on TV this president has a country to run and he has to figure out as best as he's able to\nWhat's in the best interest of the United states of America and the citizens of the United states of America\nSo he's not just going to call a talk show or or get on a cable show or or pop off about about this that and the other and he's here he's been sort of adjusting his message is more information comes off\nA comes in and as he gets more advice on what to do plus there are things going on in the middle East that he's involved in in his stamps involved in that you and I can't even imagine so what do you want them to do well let's say the royal families guilty I Know they're guilty or cutting off all relations with them but that make you happy\nNow oh I totally agree and a fruit or what you said but that last thing that you just set a second ago you're right it's an investigation my ... my the big point is you know it's not over yet the information number one\nAnd then make some decision right but he keeps defending those guys the Saudis they've got a nice guy the the really bad guy they do a lot of bad stuff and why ... why do you keep the fan and those guys\nWeathers who keep defending those guys despise those guys he did but I don't think he's\nDefending those guys I mean again I I've been sort of observing this from afar over the last the period of time since uh since the Turks put out the information that he was murdered [noise] I don't seem defending those guys if he's defending those guys why did the old man the king step in and take the power back from the sun to try and deal with\nThat situation\nWell you you know he's already come out several times or he came out with that role excuse early on that left so that's all wrong you know you have no evidence yep okay let me thought\nFor all why are we so focused on this\nWell because it's important it's about truth\nAbout honestly it's not that important it's a horrible thing that took place a horrible thing that took place but I I hate to say this 'cause I Know it will be twisted in four thousand different ways but for the United states it's simply not that important\nI mean giving a hundred and fifty billion dollars to the Iranian regime which killed which was involved in killing thousands of American Soldiers that to me it's a big\nDeal but you know the media and the lap supported that deal Obama supported that deal\n\nBut you know the media and the lap supported that deal Obama supported that deal that is a terrorist regime that is an enemy of the United states now I'm not making any excuses this man was Florida than a horrific way great\nHorrible horrible horrible horrible\nBut I don't know why are the coverage [noise] is is is so massive and neither do you\nObject like a patrol area okay and I don't hear a great man no matter what they say All right thank you sir\nThe truth is the Saudis murder that we know\nAnd do I believe the royal family was involved certainly part of it is certainly the crown prince in my view how how would they do this without knowing some of them were his right hand one of them was his right hand ... and I believe one of his intelligence guy since its top forensic guy over there isn't really any doubt about this\nNo there's no doubt about it\nBut we'll wait for the investigation will get all the facts you know but what are you what the president to do\nHe says they're going to be ... ... a severe ramifications but he's not cutting off the military so\nSo what else do you want them to do\nI'm quite serious about this I hear that criticism any suggestions what do you want him to do\n\nAnd uh I understand the Washington Post is all worked up about this and sorrow other media outlets I got I understand and I understand that people are upset about I don't like it at all I think it's outrageous I'm no fan of the Saudi regime and I never happen\nBut I'm not talking about any of that talking about the reporting is over the top in the sense that it is nonstop\n\nAnd there's so many other things going on in this country in the world that at least deserves some attention\n\nI don't

of a kind of we're going to miss him greatly when he's no longer president telling you right now we will he fights back\nHe speaks plainly you don't want to Harry Truman was president United States he would speak in plain terms he would use curse words from time to time he would do all those things right\nAnd the Democrats on the left in the media praised plane talking planes speaking hairy\nSo we have a plane speaking plane talking down doesn't on Twitter he does on a campaign ... and he's trashed\n\nWe're going to miss him after his second term is over we are my dad was right about him\nAnd [laughter] used to crack up my dad as he does make because nobody nobody gets under the skin of a leftist or a media type one in the same like Donald Trump and that's one of the reasons you love them isn't it\n\nHe that he doesn't give as good as he gets he gives better ten times better and it drives them nuts\nAnd it drives him nuts you do not have to agree with everything Donald Trump does\nBut one thing you do know he loves his country\nAnd while you might and I might disagree with them here and there we agree with them the vast majority of the time and we know his heart's in the right place we know that's not true with Joe Scarborough and make ... we know that's not true with Jake Tapper in Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo\nWe know that's not true but the miscreants and mouth contents your work at the New York times in the Washington Post this man loves our country\nAnd you can see it and you can hear it in\nHis nominees to the federal bench had been outstanding had been outstanding the left tries to paint him as mentally deranged and the media\nTakes the lead in this the media really leads the Democrat Party it's not the other way around anymore the Democrat Party is the political wing of the modern media remember I said that some of the ... say say wait a minute I heard that somewhere else it's true\nThe media leave the Democrat Party the Democrat Party actually follows the media talking\nPoints they're not even one of the same anymore\nThe Democrat Party is a lap dog for the American media president knows that you know it and I know\nAnd they get furious when you criticize\nI Want to remind the people in the media that we have freedom of the press know thanks to them thanks to those those men who they denounce all the time\nAnd I did say men those men who they denounce all the time who founded this nation we have freedom of the press they died for freedom of the press but there's also this phrase freedom of speech\nThe rest of us get to speak to we may not have printing presses they may not have\nBlog sites we may not have bays spending billions of dollars to build a soft and so forth and so on but we have the right to speak to and that includes the right to criticize the media\nIt's interesting the media have no problem criticizing their competitors CNN actually has a host whose entire job is to trash Fox Brian stopped her does this come

dangerous were fascist stick or like dictators no we're not we're the ones who believe in the bill of rights were the ones who believe in the constitution\n\nAnd I do think after a second term we are going to miss Trump the great deal because among other things he shaking things up and things need to be shaken up very very badly\nVery very badly\nYou know Trump loves the country can you really say that about all these media people who bring on these guests who trashed the country who use racism to trash the country who called Trump's supporters names\nNo you can't\nWhen we come back and we have a very very important person that I Want to present to you again\nPerson who can help us a great deal should he win his election remember every day this week every day next week at least one candidate

to disguise in camouflage their true hardcore left wing agenda aren't saying\nOh I mean I Can't even begin to describe to you how much are worth seeing that both with congressmen award as well as my opponent and others are the Democrats very purposely went out and recruited leftists who could run because they may have worn a uniform or otherwise good a wrong with the veil of centrism or moderation\nThey know liberalism doesn't sell in Texas and I'll tell you something market I think you'll you'll appreciate as well your listeners you know and I mentioned this to my opponent he never has a response\nWhy would my opponent of why we're better or not want to run in Texas for governor or state rep or senator to do all of the socialist things were at least it's constitutionally reasonable to have the debate but they know that stuff doesn't sell in Texas so the only way to win the only way\nTo go team up when they had the below sea and Chuck Schumer and the rest of the left is on the coast\nWho are trying to buy off Texas with thirty eight million dollars of money and that ain't gonna work they're not going to buy Texas because taxes are going to stand up on the wall\nWhen they figure if they can knock off\nCrews and knock off you and some of the other conservatives in these districts that they'll eventually on Texas and then on the country and that's why it's very very important that certain states like Texas Florida and so forth that we really have to win the states in as many of these seats as we possibly can now\nYou're a solid conservative I assume you would join the Freedom Caucus is that correct\nYes sir I've already a publicly um a said that I joined the Freedom Caucus I've supported Jim Jordan and his race for speaker I fundamentally believe that his campaign\nTo quote do what we said we would do hardly something that should be earth shattering but unfortunately in Washington DC it too often it is\nAnd we all know when we get out here on the campaign trail and you and your listeners know that the failures in Washington stem from their failure to do what they said they would do that is why Trump is successful and why people are a proud to support him is because when he says he's going to do something he endeavors to do it the Republicans in Congress\nFailed to do that they're failed to repeal Obamacare they failed to balance the budget and they run away from border security and the consequences are dire\nOr seeing people with two and three and four times the cost of their health health insurance premiums they can't get the doctors of their choice Twenty one and a half trillion dollars a day and now we're seeing a caravan of ten thousand people coming to our border because our guys won't do the basic job of a sovereign nation to defend the border\nThat needs to stop and we need Congress went up there who are just Republican but are conservatives who are fighting for our constitutional values and that's what I intend to do\n[noise] you know ah Obama is in Las Vegas Nevada this evening\nAnd he's telling the crowd there remember who started the economic recovery meaning him or is this man unbelievable is Obama I mean um first of all these out campaigning the way he is a this violates whole traditions but that's what he does but even more than that\nTo literally lie about his record into literally lie about who's responsible for economic growth\nWe've stalled for over eight years really go back even under the Bush administration right we had a decade of economic growth\nThat was on average and you know this is somewhere in the one percent two percent range depending on the year\nWhich was causing the continued stagnation what's causing the lack of the ability to fail ability to have the jobs that we need a lack of economic growth which obviously harm to the deficit and debt as well\nAnd now what do we say we're seeing four percent economic growth or seeing the United states for the first time at a decade labeled as the most competitive nation on earth right we're seeing a jobless claims the all time lows and not just for everybody but for groups like Hispanics and black business owners other folks\nThat we're seeing incredible successes and that is not rocket science\nYou leave money in the hands of the outdoors in the business ... you know creators\nIf you leave money in the hands of the American people if you do your basic job of governing then the American there's no limit to what we'll do we put man on the moon and Nineteen sixty nine ten years before the department of
