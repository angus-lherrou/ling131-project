DM go\nYeah try market so happy to be able to talk to you I think I've been watching this fiasco with the senator I'm complaining about how it Scott thing and more I find that they are that our president commented on this whole thing\nAnd I I just caught all of their offices actually today just to let that lower remind them that they are not\nThey have not been tasked with monitoring our president opinion orders rallies or anything else they have been tasked with the satellite dish extra FBI bologna that's like forced upon us I'm seeing if there's any additional information\nThat they can get their vote in the right call them or not I'm not monitoring our president's words and for them to come out in an actual war re superior and noxious is just really disgusting\n... to ... point David job to do and they're not doing it and that they're doing the opposite they're destroying the entire institution\nAbsolutely and and I think it's truly on your sale I mean I'm a woman on the fact that I Know well last time I do have some some friends that are most of them are very concerned about\nThe whole fact that I think that's the way that I mean I have ... amazing sound as a matter of fact\nGamble all men come from women and uh most women had men in their lives are boys in their lives who they love sons grand ... children and so forth husbands boyfriends and uh\nHow you see what Mrs Kavanaugh is going through you see what those little girls retooling through and noticed there are no Democrat senators which have shown any compassion for them not\nI haven't heard any of the cell phone calls from it and I I Can't even get that title I lost so much faster than what I have not seen any of them come out ... to ... how to do that and I just cry I cried\nAll I don't I don't even know a cartoon we're talking about to be honest with you All right I appreciate your call my friend excellent Angela Anderson South Carolina ex em satellite go\nThank you for taking my call they're All right ahead I Know I've gone I came\nOver here ... years ago in eighty nine and uh\nWhen I started on than he would feel that they came over here came over here from where\nFrom Ukraine okay\nA communist country and uh when I started going to school and uh that's why that's what I see those kids having a little kid can't remember why you know then a few he'd been used in well they live in to that food I Lived through that are my parents lived through\nYou know and uh and I always got to question why did you call them Democrats are liberal they\nCommented that wasn't folk who isn't a party was coming to fight if what you know who they are that's why did they Hitler didn't win going those people my mom's side or simply ... in my mind not because Christians if I'd have a kid but I'm about to get\nIn mind that will never come back from the from the hospital my brothers and sisters ah I ride my friend and I appreciate your call\n\nLet us go to Robert San Francisco California is a great KF oh go ahead\nMark it's an honor to speak with you I'm a couple of points of one you know the the set of this bill to\nA set of rules and traditions and and the conventions that are broken nothing but Democrats in a number of different ways and come back to haunt them for example or taking away the filibuster and things like that but I think we ought to continue to get rid of some of his legacy archaic rules\nFor example why her Dianne Feinstein or five senator or Hamel or hurt us or other fights because on the privilege of a close up\nIn the future after their behavior in this country\nAre you going to ask me a whole series of questions and you know I have no control over and none of us do over how the Senate functions and so these are good in the abstract but the fact is are they are what they are and I don't see them changing you\nWell\nYeah I'm Talking about the blue slip rule I mean that's an internal Senate tradition I don't much care for it either and you're saying but they should withdraw from are fine\nMaybe they should uh they should give out peanuts during hearings to fine I don't know but uh the point of the matter is this isn't going to get us anywhere yup\nWell are you what I mean my second for my second point is what is going to get us anywhere as I think your show and that's just regular show and into the show that you're essentially the catalyst of a preference get scared that I think is taking place right now and it's going to have the what great deal of preference ... it's\nA very similar to what the man and a from Ukraine experienced probably when people look to the left or right they say you know that person is just that something that I've been thinking for a long time but if I'm afraid to say that and eventually\nPeople start changing their preferences or at least they're stayed at preferences because they finally realized that the way they're thinking is acceptable and I think that you and your efforts have a lot to do with it\nPeople but I Hope you're right some days I really do wonder but I Hope you're right a will keep at it and Robert I Want to thank you for your call appreciate it will
