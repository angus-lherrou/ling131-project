[laughter]\n... I was expecting something British uh but he said exactly the same thing and apparently it's a it's a an English thing it's popular in Australia and so that's one of the recipes in the ...\nIn fact it's on the back cover the darn thing\nBeautiful you've got a lot of very cool recipes and here at ... by you and your wife too which is a which is really something worth a look you know let me ask you a question here if\nYou're a ... times comes up with this long article and I now read most of it really trashing the president trashing his father traction making these these these brought statements about how they're essentially tax cheats going back twenty more than Twenty years\nAnd um\nAnd they and they basically lost the IRS and they said well the Internal Revenue service basically you know look the other way and so for\nNow the Internal Revenue service doesn't look the other way right and this is a huge uh you know family business a privately held business I don't know how they got access to all this stuff I don't know if it was in the\nIn the filings with the state or or whatever it was but they are trashing Trump is he's not a self made man and look at all the money he got when he was a kid and and on and on and on this is really a set up isn't it for the Democrats or keep saying we want Trump's taxes and they're kind of handing love working with each other here in the political way\nBut that's their playbook that only God I mean they're still litigating the twenty sixteen election they cannot believe they lost to this guy\nAnd why did they lose sure because he cheated and he didn't just cheat at you know colluding with the Russians he cheated his entire business career and his family cheated his dad cheated they screwed people in the welfare system so that they would get rich and you know the allegation is you know\nHe had said that he started Donald Trump did with just a million of his father's dollars\nBut you know this story says oh what are they talking about I think I think I read four hundred and Fifteen million dollars is what his dad gave him so he was in a self made guy he was a bold him to his father who was a cheater as well\nCrazy but you know let's let's see what the facts are right now it's just one of these allegations that it's been linked to a major\nBudget that isn't the problem isn't this the problem is a huge article yes\nOne allegation after another and what are we going to spend the next six weeks on this right through the mid term elections it's all time though I don't ever remember anything like this when the Kennedy family or had LBJ became a multi millionaire just a poor man that that got elected to the Senate he dies\nA multi multi millionaire I mean so much and and Trump makes all this money before even enters the\nPresidency and they just can't wait to get their hands around his neck\nHow many times mark have we seen in the last year because it's been very effective that are members of the left and the Democrats in particular have or\nHave worked with politicians you want you want to talk about a collusion look at the link between the press and some are\nLiberal Democrats for instance I I was watching the special report\nProgram on Fox News and a a young correspondent who used to live at my house uh Peter do see that who you were talking about a minute ago you know he's out in Montana and he was covering the story about\nOther reelection campaign of John tester and Jon Tester's got a problem right now because a lot of Montanans are veterans and they don't like what he did to Dr Ronny Jackson who is the president's picked to run the VA because\nIf you remember Jon Tester leaked these are allegations unfounded allegations are I think he first started out on the floor of the Senate or it was in a committee hearing\nHe had these pages of stuff about how Ronny Jackson was drunk and he crashed the car someplace and he did these inappropriate things that he was given people bills and all that stuff\nAnd you know what then it got into the bloodstream at the media and everybody was talking about it and the White House came out uh like within a day and said look we've done to an investigation we can't find anywhere that he crashed the car or\nThese other allegations but the damage was done and he was dead it was a kill shot and it all started with unfounded allegations and that brings us right to where we are today\nHow many times have we seen these things\nAnd it's just that they keep doing it\nBecause it's work well I Want to recommend that people have a little diversion here this is a really wonderful a cookbook and uh it's a wonderful thing to put on your cocktail table to you and your wife are on the cover of that happening cookbook steam and Cassie do see I Want to wish you all the best with is\nThank you great one ...
