more stimulating\n[noise] you know one of my dearest\nFriends one of the smartest floor as I Know one of the nicest\nPeople I Know as David Limbaugh and he writes great books and he's got one out right now called Jesus reason now this isn't exactly my area of expertise but it's become his area of expertise\nHe's written a lot about politics and so forth but he now has written extensively about Christianity David Limbaugh how are you my friend\nMark how are you a thank you so much for having me on\nWell it's a great pleasure in the book as as I say Jesus risen first of all let me ask you this you are more and more a writing you're really you become a bit of a scholar in this area of Christianity and so forth how did you come to this point\nWhen I was a young adult I wasn't really a believer I I was always believed in God but I I didn't quite have branched out of the Bible and so I really\nStarted studying it and and I had to overcome some hospitals ... overcome some doubt\nAnd when I finally became a believer I I thought OK I'm holding in my hand the word of God with the Bible and I was so in all of that so many ways that I wanted to inhale it and gobble it up and read as much as I could learn as much as I could about the Bible and theology and I I wished at that time\nThat there were some short cut that there are some a guide some tremors that would help me get a hold a handle on the Bible more quickly than I did it takes a lot of\nWork if you do it on your own takes a lot of work anyway and and it's worthwhile work but as I\nStudied it I I I wanted to share what I learned because I was so excited about it so I tried to write a book on it and this was before I had any platform and written any columns and written any books and it didn't really go anywhere was premature but then I started writing a column and\n... and probably ten or Fifteen Years later I'd written all those columns two calls a week every week and I got five books under my belt and I thought well and now the platform I've got a little more confidence uh and I might just a try this again so I wrote my first Christian themed book and\nExpress explain my faith journey and why I Believe in Christianity and then from there and I've just gone on to write other books in the last one was a book about the gospel or where I go through the gospels and explain what the text isn't really a kind of paraphrase it in chronological order\nAnd then also interspersed commentary from some of the greatest Christian bankers and some of my own inside and I wanted to continue with the New Testament after that because I ran out of space literally on that book so I started with the book of acts in this\nBook and it has a history of the early church\nAnd six of Paul's Thirteen of pistols his letters to the early church it's\nSo that's what this book is is just a continuation of a my attract through the New Testament and I've got more to go and the next book Greg Greg my publisher agrees to do it so what what the short answer your question is I was on fire for the Bible remain on fire\nThe Bible study that really pretty hard for a lay person or the last Twenty years on and off and I wanted to share that passion you help people where I was they were who were doubters and wanted to learn more\nAnd give them some kind of a primer and in a deep dive if they wanted to go further I\nHope this book is both deep and accessible at the same time and will help people learn about the Bible and most of all inspire them to read the Bible for themselves and learn about it\n[noise] let me ask you this question when you look around the world you\nSee Christianity under attack even in our own country it's under attack in different ways to look in the middle east and same with Judaism you would think that the only religion that ever existed in the middle east was Islam and you're just a certain religion to exist\nAnd Christians had been pushed out of most of the Arab countries obviously there are individuals who want to push the Jews have sort of Jerusalem in Israel but when you look at our own country talk about the Supreme Court and the courts generally there is a growing hostility\nTowards Christianity being think your book will help people better understand that they don't have to be afraid of your face to face\nGood question I I really believe that the Judeo Christian tradition is at the bedrock of our constitutional principles and I realize there in white and that influences and Judeo Christian principles a behind the constitution and our liberties\nAnd what our tradition stance for the day of Christian Church tradition stance or afraid we believe were made in God's image we believe where we have these innate rights ... writes that come from God that comes from our religious tradition and\n... as a result of really believing that from the core of ourselves that we all men are entitled to that freedom we by definition do not want to suppress the freedom and liberty at any one else their religious or political liberty and that includes people whose views are and that and that the U.S\nThere for the last in response to your question has nothing to fear for it for much atheist have nothing to fear from as Islam as long as it doesn't attack us has nothing to fear from us\nAnd yet the the the suppressor the totalitarian the authoritarians a suppressor of free speech and liberty\nCome from the left and we do have something to fear from them and so I don't like this notion that Christians should oranges should sit\nIdly by a while the secular laugh destroys our liberties destroys our way of life destroy sacred values that that underlying undergrad all of our freedoms\nAnd we can't just as some Christian some past a Christian suggests we can't just pray and expect God to do it all of course we pray and we put it under his control but he put us\nHere for a purpose we didn't just we we weren't just placed on earth that he passed a bystander we need to be active and there's nothing\nIncompatible with Christianity and political activism as long as we are acting in accordance\nWith our principles and that's what I think we try to do and I we have to fight the last as hard as they find that we don't have to be as dirty as they are but we do have to be as relentless and isn't chance and that's what we need to do and yes they have nothing to fear from as we have a lot to be concerned about in terms of what they would do to us if they had the power\nThe book is Jesus is risen it's by David Limbaugh or you can get at an Amazon dot com or you can go to my site secure they're already ... show Facebook Mark Sullivan show Twitter we have a link to it it is really a fascinating and um\nAnd went into the er the audience little interesting discussion you and I had when I said I Want you to come on and discuss your book and David is so respectful of other face and other beliefs and other people he said well\nAre you really short because you know I'm I'm Talking about Jesus and you know and you're Jewish and so forth\n[noise] and I said I get it it's okay I Want you to come on my show I Want you to talk about this I'll tell you why David and we're going to come back in thirty seconds\nI say more vibrant some more rigorous people are in the Christian faith\nSit better society is I feel the same way about my own religion Judaism\nAnd so let's discuss that a little bit when we come back I'll be right back [noise]\n[noise] yes pollen dirt we spend most of our time indoors film libraries in the outdoors when you're inside kill with others hundred scientists to choose from plus cost him options we have a solution to make your indoor air cleaner pressure and\nYes and and that's been documented in and a lot of people want to do about that because it has any interest of the secularists to say to rewrite history to revise history insight that the framers were not religious men that they were secularists and that\nUh they they say that as a result of that we should get back to our secular values\nAnd when they they wanna radically transform fundamentally transform our nation or back to secularism and those kind of values that but because they distort what really it really was\nBut we know for a fact what they want to transform us back to something that's on last night to our founding principles and we watched the totalitarian tendency the last\n... as Obama tried to bring on and he wanted to fundamentally transform the nation either nothing like\nIt appeared at the time nothing like it was founded and you've written eloquently about this and you know that his son in mental transformation was not a restoration of where we started about a radical transformation away from it and the completion of the destruction of our founding principles in my view\nNow again not [laughter] I Want to say I'm an expert on this subject won't even say I'm close to that but the way you're dividing your writings on this and you kind of touched on at the beginning is how is how and then where do you go from here\n[noise] okay I Am\nA again wanting to complete my Journey Through the New Testament I'd already written some on the Old Testament and I want to help\nSo these this and I want to give them a historical perspective and so the book of back to the early church the history of the early church really happened in history these are real people\nAnd and I wrote and I and I included the book of acts as I say which is the history of the early church and the sex of the apostle Paul Thirteen of pills he writes each forms the Iraqis letters to the churches after he had planted these churches throughout the Roman empire and they're falling away from the religion they're falling prey\nThe secular influence is just like we said today the secular influences up the pagan shitty of corn which was dominated by a sexual immorality and I'd our trade from the\nMainly feature of the the love God of Africa id\nAnd Paul would write to these churches in such a personal an intimate way saying look I formed us up I Would birth a baby and I told you the truth\nGospel and here you are deviating listen to the listening to these taken influences in following year less will desires and he told them what they needed to do to get back on course not follow the false teachers but remember what he told them when he was there\nAnd then he gives them instruction on practice a Christian living how to live right\nOut to be good moral people listen to the Holy Spirit of a bay the Holy Spirit\nAnd then and then continue to do what is right and he also expanded on the doctrine Christian doctor and what's interesting mark is this really happened in history\nAnd I want to give readers essential that history because when when they when they read it they will understand really happening all the Paul wrote these letters to particular church it\nHe didn't know that though they were inspired by God they would be a political to all of us\nFor the next two thousand or however many years the world exist\nSo there have universal application to all churches and all the people who read these letters even though they were written to individual people edit that specific point in time in history we still profit from him today as Christians leave their holy scripture the New Testament they become part of the New Testament and God's word in our view\nSo it's just ... miraculous how this has occurred and people can really profit from these from these words which we believe are God's work so I Want to help all my book is not\nA God's word it's a book about gods were trying to sell a take people's understanding advance their learning curve reduced or intimidation about the Bible and most of all it as I said again inspire them to read it and gobble it up like I've tried to do the last Twenty years\nWell you're very much the renaissance man the subjects that you've written about over the years really are um [noise] a very well they cover a lot of territory and this is this was in ... that is very very important to you and true to you and you dedicate the
