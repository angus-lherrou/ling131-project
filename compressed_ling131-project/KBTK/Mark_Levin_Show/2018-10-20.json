Wisconsin Josh your next step on the mark within show I'm Larry O'Connor\nIowa aerial I'm good I I'm concerned though because if the Democrats do get the majority in the house this is going to be a rough two years\nThat's and I have an idea I'm Talking to your street car and I said that a good idea that they should do is they could show Detroit when it's ran by businessmen like Donald Trump say in Henry Ford and the strength that the trait once had\nAnd then once Democrat liberal take over and how it just falls into corruption in squalor and just showed them side by side and then even better for my own state I think they'd on how their mouth\nIf you let politician and take over you get Detroit if you what Republicans take over and have ideas you get Foxconn and he'd do look for jobs that were getting shocked and I yeah I Wish they would tell them that more and more and more and they don't\nYeah and and you know Josh I'm Glad you brought this up because I I Love Wisconsin and I think that uh your Governor Scott Walker has done some great jobs in it is incredible turn around what he's been able to achieve in that state and of course they all said that people would be fired and people would be starving in the streets and no one would get an education and it's been phenomenal\nYeah and we saw um I'm Scott member and Madison there Oh yes and that took on our capital and we fought right short and look at what we've been able to accomplish that strikes as second half of the term of Donald Trump if it if we fight the good fight and vote on November ...\nThank you Josh thank you for the call appreciate it thanks for calling into the market within show ya I vividly remember those mobs taking over the capital occupying the capital of Madison during the early years of

mean he is he's a former military uh did combat in Iraq\nUh this guy is African American this guy is conservative this guy is right on all the issues are they here I Want to play a little bit of of him because because this tells you exactly how the media so corrupt\nBecause all they care about with federal Rourke it has to do with two things it has to do with forcing this fake narrative\nThat the Democrats are really got into the Texas is moving blue Texas is going to be a democratic state Texas is not the same Texas because the Democratic that demographic changes because uh because of all of the radical conservative policies that have heard that they would say I haven't I mean\nPeople are flocking to Texas people are flocking to Texas because of the economy there is one of the only states the persevere through the eight ... years of ... because they had Republicans in charge of that state there is no way that people have Texas would reverse that trend but also because they hate

I Want to hear from you our use something not as well or your friends telling you that or is it quite the opposite of what I think that I'm seeing right now the women especially women and Republican women are actually more motivated than they were\nBefore this cabinet disaster for the Democrats uh Jan in Dallas listening on WBAI pi I'm Larry O'Connor on the Merkel venture\nLarry King hey how you

the early ... and and and and waiting and I\nHonestly I think that women back and I don't think he's dead or something that's not what it and\nDon't think that you get I think you made a great point about the difference between me\nAnd the holiday as they have it all gets you out it was ... and I I cannot believe that there are people out there that fell for it you know ...\nThank you ... you made a great point and coming from your perspective as a feminist from ... or ... you know growing up in the feminist movement of the baby boomer of this whole thing is the opposite of empowering women it's painting or women as victims I'm Larry O'Connor the market within show\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations and one ... gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nExplodes\nOr the best gift you can give to a young person in your life who are just getting out of college maybe or starting to establish themselves in the world would be a subscription to while the podcasts of your favorite talk radio host or because that's where things happen that were things change\nSo ladies thank you but I Am lifting the or the gender ban here I Want to talk about this\nThere called caravan what what is that a caravan a caravan sounds like it's some sort of a fun little vacation\nWhere all you and you and your mate soul you know you you you all take your separate cars and you follow each other down the expressway to get to the campsite\nOh come on we're going to care of it and at the beach but it's all ... up to the mountains will go fishing it's going to be a care of that it's terrific have you seen these pictures have you seen the video\nOf the they all have by the way everyone in this uh this migration this this is the invasion\nThis reprehensible international crisis they make no mistake is absolutely organized these things don't spontaneously happen it's impossible\nAnd if you if you go to your favorite search engine and type in Honduran caravan\nOrganizers they'll give you a list of several names couple of them just got arrested in Guatemala the Guatemalan government arrested them and send them back to Honduras but there's still people organizing this\nOf course that have you noticed that that all the people in this they all have brand new backpacks\nWeird isn't that odd\nThey all have brand new backpacks full of all their personal belongings and they're all waving the flag of their nation El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras and they're demanding entry into Mexico and they are saying to whatever reporter will talk to them we are going to the United states of America and you can't stop\nUs and if you listen to most of our elected officials guess what their rights we can't stop them\nWhat are we going to do\nYou know the Democrats and sadly many Republicans on Capitol Hill don't hesitate to criticize President Trump for his policy of securing our border enforcing immigration laws as they are written prosecuting\nCriminals who break our immigration laws deporting criminals in this country for violating our immigration laws\nIt's a very clear cut policy by the way one that believe it or not used to be embraced by Democrats too\nAnd Republicans\nUntil they figured out that they could get votes and or campaign donations\nRespectively for being an international list for being all about open borders for being compassionate uh you know what's compassionate compassionate does not enabling people to continue to follow the same\nBroken destructive patterns that they have year after year after decade after decade you know what's compassionate wanting the Honduran people to be empowered to alter and change\nThe Honduran government or the Mexican government you're terrified for your life in Honduras I get it that's what we were terrified for our lives hundreds of years ago here in America we made a change\nBut that will remember when we all love the Arab Spring were we had people rise up against their governments across the middle east because they were set up and they were done I is it time maybe for a Central Americans spring why as the default obligation\nFor America and for the mainstream media to be oh things are awful in these countries\nCome in we capture back why is that\nSuddenly the definition of compassion why is that suddenly the definition of being a real American oh if you don't open up your borders and allow anyone into this country you're anti American you're not really upholding American ideals are values are you kidding me\nSince when and how many by the way this is a caravan of four thousand if we let them in do you think that'll stop it hasn't for the last five years it hasn't\nThey keep coming why because we let them in\nAnd said earlier today I actually got to speak with a Democrat Senator Ben curtain\nOr he is a senator in Maryland here in the greater Washington area is running for reelection and I asked him that I said you know what what should we do to stop these people from coming into the country led listen because this is very this is very indicative of of how they think and how they talk what should we do to stop that should we stop that\n[noise] well one one of the reasons we've had a program to try to improve the living conditions in Central America\nOh it's been supportive bipartisan Democrats or Republicans it's who the President Trump's budget or we want to improve the living conditions for those of our neighbors who live in Central America\nHe hit and he goes on on this and think about what she's saying here and this is this is considered\nBe the the the ah highest level of statesmanship in Washington DC we've got thousands and thousands of people who make no Bones Are secret about the fact that they are a demanding entry into our country because they hate the country they're living in and the police\nAnd the people who make no Bones Are secret about the fact that they are a demanding entry into our country because they hate the country they're living in and the politically correct acceptable ... old man on Capitol Hill response as well how many billions can we get to that government down there to improve conditions\nAnd by the way we've sent billions and billions and billions and billions already and somehow\nIt hasn't solved the problem and and think about what the basis of this argument is to stop people from invading our borders we must throw billions of dollars to their countries it's extortion\n\n... we're bribing them we're bribing the government's down there to get control of their own citizenship and then you get the Mexican government leadership and for that matter how during that all of these countries in Central America where their citizenship is leaving in droves to go to another country\nAnd they're angry at us for saying no they can't come in let's think about that for a minute you're an elected official you've been elected by your population in\nEl Salvador in in Guatemala in Mexico you've been elected to represent them you've been elected to run the affairs of the country\nAnd the people who elected you are fleeing your country\nTo go elsewhere and your response is not gee maybe we're doing something wrong maybe we need to fix our country no your response is how dare you America not allow my citizens to fleet my end after corrupt government to come into your country\nThese countries spend more time focusing on our policies then fixing and then you've got a Democrat like Ben Carson who enables vets who enables that by throwing more money at it\nSo I came back and we went back and forth on this earlier today\nWhen if you want you can get the whole interview over at a my radio station to be a male dot com but I I came back around and I said All right listen I Know you want to throw a bunch of money at this government and you want to do all of these things on the ground to keep them from going but\nThat's not going to stop these four thousand okay there on the way and frankly whatever money you send down there you've already sent plenty and that hasn't fixed the problem I don't know how much more money you got to spend but let's focus\nOn what's happening right now 'cause you have a lot of criticism for President Trump for saying he's going to send the military down there for saying he's going to cut funding if these countries don't stop their own citizens from playing yeah you have all this criticism of him for actually trying to protect our borders so what would you do your senator for crying out loud\nWhat's the solution how do you stop these people from coming into our country when they reach our border what are we supposed to do\nWell I don't know if I'll agree with you on on that statement I I I've been embedded with the FBI down to Central America I Know how dangerous the\nBirds are by the way I real fast and they just ... ... these ... I had just said that there's a criminal element that there are dangerous gang members who are coming along with the than we know that to be true he's telling me that it's not true\nYou get a fine you you you were you reach your own conclusion I report you decide do you think maybe there was a violent criminal element over the last several years the came along and cross the border\nWith these unaccompanied minors don't or they were all seven year old children really they all had tattoos\n... we quibble\nA I have interviewed a gang member who actually came to the United states has set up sister gangs including in Maryland so I I I understand the danger factor as it relates to these gang activities\nI think most of the families that show up in our border or people who see themselves as desperate they're trying to escape Central America in some cases they get out of fear of their lives should be able to seek asylum\nRight okay so fine so so let's say they're coming to this country to seek asylum what do we do\nWell if they have a legitimate claim for asylum claim should be heard no one should be admitted to our country without proper vetting", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "20"}
