I've read your book men in black and understand the power of the court and the bottom line here is we've got to find people that can construed the document as originally intended\nAnd that means rejecting this a living constitution nonsense that's pushed by the likes of Kennedy and a Sotomayor and the like\nWe need to find more skill is more a Clarence Thomas's more individuals like Gorsuch that can stand the construed the stock in the way it was meant to be\nAnd what that means simply is the federal government is way too large it's doing way too much article one section it gives an old our supposed to have all the other powers blow to the states and the people respectively so when every vote cast in every speech ... the idea that dean centralize the power of the federal government\nAnd give those hours back to the people\nChris McDaniel tell us a tell us about your race in Mississippi how's it going\nIt's going very well obviously the establishment\nOr they work hard cut off our money supplies that's one of the big fights but we always have when you stand up against the establishment when you push back\nThey punish conservative for doing that\nAnd yet we still have to have the courage and the guts to push back because they cannot be allowed to destroy this country the way they have over the last several years [noise] so what happens is they turn off our biggest of money and we have to find new ways to raise it and the spy despite the fact we'd be outspent tend to one we're still winning the race\nThere's at least one pack whole social stuff between eight and ten other polls whisper it around town so what's up two or three other polls show us down five but bottom line is we're winning this race without five thousand volunteers on the ground\nWe have a superior a ground game superior social media presence and if we can just get enough help blocking tackle for the next few days we're going to win this race out right\nNow when it out right it's the top two vote getters or if you get over fifty percent urine\nYes or that's the case or fifty percent we're in\nA but there's a there's good news there in any of that despite the fact if if we just barely get under the fifty percent were forced to a runoff\nThat naturally uh makes us the or the winter and I'll tell you why it's called enthusiasm called motivation our days is ready to Pfizer ready to rumble and we have a lot of people out there they're going to vote rain we shine it doesn't matter so we're excited about that\nSo if the people around the country want to assist you with the donations and the people in Mississippi one who says she would donations and are going door to door where did they go\nLike Daniel twenty eight teams dot com is the website like Daniel twenty eight to ... dot com and of course on social media Senator Chris McDaniel on Twitter and Facebook and I'll tell you stuff that I Want you to think about this if you can't find a conservative state like Mississippi to fight for you where are you going to find it\nNew York can't do this for you California can't do this for you it has to be the deep south you're sent me to Washington I Will fight every day to restore our constitution and to finally get Trump's agenda passed no more structure knows what Mitch McConnell we're going to get it passed one for all\nI think people forget that so much of Trump ... agenda that he requires legislation has been left on the cutting floor\nIncluding the issue of the wall and immigration and the massive spending they give they give Trump these bills that increase defense spending which we all want and then it increases spending across the board and this is a huge problem\nYes or listen we walk that wall built\nWe won't trim limits imposed we want to say no to Afghanistan DACA now's the time to find our guts again as conservatives we have no\nWhere else that go we have nothing else to surrender nothing else to compromise the idea that we have to chase the Democrats for social of them is nonsense [noise] this is our time to stand in the gal in force this country back toward liberty back toward the ride this is for all the marbles we cannot

Mississippi but you know senators vote on issues that affect all of us all of us\nAnd uh I just can't imagine the people in Mississippi are electing somebody who was a Hillary Clinton supporter for all those years Chris McDaniel we wish you all the best sir\nGod Bless you sir lifted after five thank you\nAll right name and take care of yourself keep an eye on that race Chris McDaniel very very important\nThat would be a shocker that would shake up the system and he's got a good shot at it he just needs some support needs some financial support so\nI Hope you will check out my social sites

a racist and enough enough is enough this guy's an Iraq War veteran this guy went to Harvard law school he's done everything the right way everything is supposed to\nUm and ah in more than that easy solid constitutional conservative with capitalism he's running against a radical used to work for people for the American way\nI'm In new was supported by George Soros and the guy a got a big push big endorsement from the hard left Bernie Sanders now he's trying to uh to kind of address it all up which is what the hard left us\nIn order to Deceive Us many people as as possible and there's a lot of
