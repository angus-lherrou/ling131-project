which I also share on my Twitter Larry O'Connor\nOr this one tells you how the hidden hand of Mike Bloomberg is behind it all the headline is how Bloomberg embed green warriors in blue state

democratic state attorneys general and paying them to prosecute\nEnergy companies and challenge Trump Administration policies on energy and the environment you\nUnderstand what that opening something said this is a program at the NYU school of law it's funded by Bloomberg and they place lawyers in the offices of the state's attorney general\nAnd end their job they're getting money from the NYU law program not from the state but they're working in the state attorneys general office\nTo sue the Trump Administration and energy companies\nNine states continuing down the article nine states and

this week amid expectations of a run for president in twenty twenty the fourteenth current fellows in the program report to the attorneys general\nBut they are paid by NYU's Bloomberg funded state energy and environmental impact center where these these these socialist groups all have these insidious names\nThe state energy and environmental impact center it's just a big slush fund to pay lawyers to disrupt the Trump Administration\nAnd to make life miserable for energy companies state AG offices hire these trained lawyers not students but season professionals with years of experience as\nCity assistance they're special assistant attorney general they don't work for the state but the answer to the state attorney general\nUnder terms of the arrangement the fellows works solely to advance progressive environmental policy at a time when democratic state attorneys general have investigated ensued Exxon Mobil and other energy companies over alleged damage due to climate change\nAlthough many government agencies have employees funded by outside sources critics say using special interest money for targeting government action is inappropriate yeah I'm One critic who would say that\nIs outrageous New York Pennsylvania are you happy with this\n\nChristopher Horner a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute who wrote a report on the NYU center said the fellowships come with specific strings attached quoting him now the AG officers must agree to use prosecutors to advance progressive clean energy climate change and environmental legal positions Horner said\nDavid Hayes the center's executive director did not respond to multiple requests for comment I'm sure he didn't because we got it\nWe got 'em dead the rights we got um red handed\nBloomberg froze millions of dollars of this NYU program NYU that hires attorneys hired guns places them in the offices of the attorney general the attorney general doesn't come out of his budget doesn't come out of the state budget\nThey answer to the attorney general you know who's bidding they're doing they're not doing the bidding of you the voter you the people in most states they're doing the bidding of where the money's coming from\nThis program at NYU funded by Bloomberg that specifically then sous Exxon Mobil Chesapeake like what whatever oil company in this country\nOr Suzie PA and the Trump Administration trying to shut down progress trying to shut down our economy trying to shut down fracking or oil drilling\nSo that they can do the bidding of the well
