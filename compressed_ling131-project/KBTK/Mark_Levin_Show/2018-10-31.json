of which you agree so you're a citizen of the tribe and the citizen of the United states\nThere's a Supreme Court opinion in Eighteen Ninety eight United States versus one Kim arc we've talked about this I've written about it and that declared the fourteenth amendment adopted the common law definition of birthright citizenship [noise]\nUm but the decision conferred birthright citizenship when a child of legal residents of the United states\nNow the majority is broad enough to include children born illegally in the United states as well as legal immigrants but that's not what the court decided it wasn't even presented to the court and so of\nCourse you have individuals who are trying to read it into it the court has never decide\nThat illegal alien\nThat is the children of illegal aliens for automatically citizens of the United states think of the absurdity of\nThose who passed the amendment specifically rejected the idea\nWe know who would apply to the freed slaves\nAnd we know that in the Nineteen sixties at some point the interpretation change for the executive branch\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with addiction please call this toll free number\nFor a hundred and Thirty years there's an uninterrupted stream of case law including cases written by the one Kim arc justice Horace Gray saying that if you come here without consent\nAnd you do not have legal status it is in the most literal and physical sense as if you were standing outside of our boundaries in terms of access\nTo the court in terms of rights in terms of everything so literally you are not on our soil and and that is settled law so when Congress nearly cut and paste the text of the fourteenth amendment in Nineteen fifty two they could've never fathom that such an egregious argument\nThat someone who is in Nineteen fifty to the constitution was not interpret it as giving citizenship to the children of illegal aliens\nExactly it's like saying proved to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to mandate gay marriage well I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I could see from my research is that\nFor most of our history we didn't have too many illegal aliens in the early part of the twentieth century it was in the sixties and seventies and eighties it started to grow\nAnd there was never an active decision what happened was because most people are born here who who are born here are obviously legitimate citizens\nAnd we believe in birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants hospitals never asked any questions and H H death on the Social Security administration never clamp down on it on the back end how do I know this is true because everyone agrees that children of diplomats are excluded right I mean that's the whole point\nThat they are not subject to American law they everybody\nAgrees children uh diplomats tourists\nWho just come to the United states I mean real tourists not not the the shame that we see taking place in some of these places but just because you're a tourist in the United states you have to give birth doesn't mean that you then a seed or a burst birthright citizenship to the United states if you say from Canada\nExactly exactly I mean that's that's the point so you know there is evidence that there are plenty of children of diplomats that are also being handed a citizenship papers and they have to administer agents had been extremely lax\nAnd in that case everyone agrees they're not entitled to it so again this is a passive act\nTrump is actually restoring\nThe real law on this dates back to the Ulysses S grants attorney general or just a couple of years after the fourteenth amendment passed he said very clearly\nThat this means people subject to complete jurisdiction not aliens with parents born abroad um there were two other cases before then that's the same thing this justice gray overturned that inexplicably and this is just the stuff that nobody is willing to talk about\nMm now let's make something very very clear about this they say it's a dubious legality for the president to do this with an executive order let's walk through this together so in the Nineteen sixties and seventies the bureaucracy starts concerning citizenship\nOn the children of illegal aliens not based on the statute not based on the constitution it takes hold throughout the federal bureaucracy who's in charge of the federal bureaucracy dinner with\nThe president\nThe president you know so if president since you know what\nI I I'm going to stop that some of the river then including the leader of the Republicans in the house they say you can't change the constitution by executive order you know that's what Obama was doing we don't do that kind of stop\nYour point earlier he's not changing the constitution by executive order he's not re interpreting the constitution by executive order he's getting the executive branch under control and saying this is what the fourteenth amendment means\nThis is what I wrote in my book stolen sovereignty literally we have stolen sovereignty the executive branch made this decision imagine if the people would have voted or Congress would have conducted a vote\nWe're going to give citizenship to hundreds of thousands of people every year who break into our country against their consent no one would have ever voted for that that was a bureaucratic creation\nAnd again let's zoom back to asylum to many other changes Trump is making he's nearing ... merely restoring\nThe constitution and the statutes he's overturning the other administrative\nA lawless acts of previous administrations you know very well marketing and you do this as well as conservative review we are not in lockstep with everything that any party does we'll call the president now if we disagree with something\nBut everything he has done an immigration is actually the base statute its past administrations have done this a verdict that he's changing\nSo I mean is the head of the executive branch she doesn't need a statute\nOr to reverse what the executive branch did without a statute does he\nKnow know unless Congress the only thing that could happen if Congress with their naturalization power could explicitly say ... give US citizenship to all legal they could do that\nBut until they were at ... isn't the problem though that the courts might aren't the courts out of control even these so called constitutional is on the court\nUm you know to stay on popular opinion here I mean this was my concern about Gorsuch and I think we've seen that in ...\nWho wish list on the court\nUm you know to stay on popular opinion here I mean this was my concern about Gorsuch and I think we've seen that in a very similar sovereignty case and the Maya the sessions um I I don't know if we have five votes I doubt Roberts will be with us but\nI don't think I I don't I don't think a cabinet with me with us\nI I think yeah I mean I I Know Tom is would be based on his past writings and his understanding of sovereignty\nBut but here's the broader question issuing citizenship birth certificate that is an executive power who's to say that the judiciary has the final say this is not something you know IBM versus Microsoft case or controversy this is the most foundational national question\nAnd the notion that we're going to see that to the courts\nBut the problem is the courts sees it for themselves look what look what they did to the president when he was simply trying to have a six month respite so we could vet people coming here from six\nMajority Muslim countries that are spreading terrorism in those countries where there's civil war in those countries it didn't even include a majority of Muslim countries where the vast majority of Muslim population and look what happened in these federal district court some circuit courts you you have to hold your breath\nOh and and by the way since Trump won in Trump V. ally in the Supreme Court subsequent lower courts have come back and basically repeal that Supreme Court decision\nThey're just totally disregarding it and putting injunction on very similar policy this is what happened and I I don't know the answer for this one as a society as a body politic\nBoth the executive branch and member of the Congress of both parties say let's see what the courts say well I mean if the courts are not a concurrent power side by side but standing over then we have North Korea and there's no elections\nSo this is the problem yeah I I don't think this will do well in the courts but again they would stay the same thing if Congress or to do it just last week a district judge said that a statute of Congress\nMaking it illegal for local communities to thwart federal immigration law is unconstitutional not the president statute so I don't know what you do with that\nMhm [noise]\nWell here we are but one of the things I'm very pleased about is it sounds like the president is taking the son now I hear some of the race ... on cable TV while actually cable TV filled with race matters and I heard one of them say recently that today\nThe president brought this up the crate division president even bring it up he was asked about by by a reporter who was interviewing him who got word that they are quietly looking at this and the counsel's office or maybe the department of justice even said I don't know how you got that information and they turned it into a race issue of course they're going to write\nMark you know it's tragic about the race issue\nAnd and this is really ironic and really said the fourteenth amendment was crafted to ensure that the declaration of independence were actually the vision would actually the actual live and the bare bones minimum writes life liberty and property would be given to black American citizens that should've been citizens for many years they were here for centuries\nAnd instead that is being bastard dies to subvert the actual meeting and disenfranchise all American citizens black and white and everything else at the hands of of of illegal immigrants it it makes no sense as a\nRubber ... let me just say that I have to go so let's let's be abundantly clear about that amendment was for black Americans\nThat amendment that amendment was for former slaves that's it\nDone and it was to make sure that they were treated as equals citizens the whole point of the civil or the post civil war amendments was to protect\nFormer slaves had nothing to do
