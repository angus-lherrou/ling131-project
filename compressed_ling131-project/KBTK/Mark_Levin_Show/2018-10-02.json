and\nTrying to do a little bit of my own research that research background\nI think that she was a cheerleader and high school and there was there was something on the Web that talked about when the

did anybody asked that question\nExactly that was my point it did they ask those questions about Kavanaugh yes did they ask those questions about her no\nExactly and that's why she and her lawyers do never never ever want to see the inside of a courtroom\nRight at the other thing\nThat I wanted to mention that to other things so I have time I've been\nA long time\nUm you might have covered just 'cause I turn my radio off than what I'm Talking about I think that the right to conduct I read on Fox dot com\nRoughly said that if he was running for reelection he would never have called for the FBI investigation because he said if I help on Clinton correctly said you'll be no value and now in fact it I couldn't believe I read\nThe guy's a chameleon he's been a chameleon his entire political life certainly while he's been in the Senate absolute chameleon everyone knows that the because he bashes Trump\nOr because he can't win re election in Arizona He does this drama thing which was kind

not PR investigation which is not a criminal investigation Andrea thank you for your call Mike San Francisco the great cast so if I go\nTo mark thank you for having me on I appreciate it yeah I Want to ask you a question about lying I concede although I absolutely believe that calculus guilty of at least some of these things like that because it's so long hold on\nHold on I Can't do the hit and run stuff what is he guilty of\nIf I'm just saying what I Believe but I concede that we may all the Marta evidence a sufficient for criminal court room which this isn't that he is guilty\nWhy isn't it on my why why sir sir you're you're you're doing your you know hit and run stuff why don't they bring it to court I don't think why don't why I I'm happy to answer your question you're going to answer mind first\nYou said he's guilty I Want to know what and you said it's not a quarter of law and yet it could be a court of law couldn't\n[noise] ah well they could go to Montgomery County police department but they haven't have they\nKnow of course not and\nYou only if it were my daughter I Would tell her to go over to the Montgomery County police department and go ahead and swear out a criminal complaint and I would do that as a father and a lawyer so how come they're not\nWell I Can't tell you what is in their minds are what\nThey asked you can't you're telling me watching Kavanaugh's mind you told me he's guilty\nThat's not what it is in his mind that's\nMore online that isn't a matter of being in your mind it's a process if you honestly believe that somebody raped you or molested you or try to do that and there's no statute\nOf limitations where it took place not\nWhen I go swear out a criminal complaint\nYet for all we know that that might or civil complain might happen in the future the question\nAbout the future I care about now when it's real and it matters but go ahead asked me are tough question\nThank you um I could list for you for five six demonstrable lies told me what judge Kavanaugh skinny one say give me one okay here's one uh NBC News out today with a story a cabin on\nThursday said that he had never heard of the Yale allegations until the New Yorker story about Ronan Farrow and Jane my came out I mean she news reporting that they have checks that Kavanaugh sent to ACL classmates before that story came out\nWell then he heard of it then contemporaneously how is that why\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nIs a great product and I liked about the most\nIs that when you open the bottles you can smell like at the center of this is that\nFriend of mine rights me that the Montgomery County chief of police the county state's attorney says\nUm that are\nUnder the laws that existed in Nineteen eighty two the express Smith time or the allegations made by Dr Ford salt and attempted rape or both misdemeanor subject to a one year statute of limitations well that's true but they also said the other day that they're open for any complaint that wants to be a foul and they're happy to investigate it\nSo go ahead and follow your complaint who stopping them are filing a complaint but they're not going to file a complaint All right\nLet's take a few more calls here let's see let's go to\nLisa Brainerd, Minnesota accent satellite go\nFor taking my call 'em out across on on what to ask your opinion on whether or not the FBI can be trusted and that the cat in our case given the history of the Hillary investigation\nWell people have asked me that question and I think we'll see a at the outcome I think what you're going to see\nIs the Democrats if they're unhappy with the outcome they're going to start attacking the FBI they're going to start attacking it as a uh it's not a full some investigation they're already doing not and not investing enough witnesses the president's looming so are these people and not to be taken seriously these people are to be seen role\nSo that's the best I can answer okay thank\nYou All right you got a gym in New York City the great WABC go\nTaking my call most of them you got it I Would hope that somebody could\nBut Republican colleagues to stop using\nCredit rather not my colleagues I can tell you that but anyway go ahead\nAll right the Democratic brutal brutal or whipping up like up to ... work ... with the word for better or vice versa actually there were a credible a correct credible clip about\nHer testimony proper for corporate mom who bought it but it was not on only she did not develop the rump all of them for most of them ... story\nWho ... who we do get hurt claims and there was no I'm from Brooklyn provided that will suffer with both of any nature court what she said\nI'm not quite the contrary as the prosecutor points out there's a lot of serious questions to be raised in\nI think they were very very lucky and the Republicans are very foolish with this five minute rule\nAnd cutting her off they were listening to some of the analysts on Fox and other other cable station saying she's not scoring\nShe that people aren't paying attention to this uh I think the ... tunnel set it I'm not attacking I'm just making a point it was very frustrating for me at the time and I pointed it out last week they're dead wrong she scoring points quote unquote cheese making points points that are very very crucial and we are
