pay attention to this\nAnd it Wisconsin you have a great governor in Wisconsin Walker\nAnd he's in the fight of his political career urine the fighter your political career\nThis was very very

are some of the very very important Senate races that are taking place that we have an opportunity to truly when\nWe love Chris McDaniel in Mississippi as many of you know he's running for the Senate there is an actual conservative by the way it's a real concern\n\nSo that's very important race and we like Patrick Morrisey very much in West Virginia against mansion\n\nMany you folks in West Virginia remember mansion is your governor well I Want you to think about 'em as your senator 'cause he's been awful\nHe'll throw vote here and there but you need better than that you\nWent better than that I think now we have all these house races I Can't possibly get into all of them I Would say this in Huntington Beach California have\nDana Rohrabacher don't agree with Dana Rohrabacher on everything but I can tell you this\nIs a good man he's oregano I remember when he and I worked in the Reagan White house together he was a speechwriter for Ronald Reagan he's in the fight of his career now do you really want some left wing cook to represent you\nThere are other races in California about seven of them and the Democrats are hoping he went all seven so they can take the house and I can assure you that the media if it's close or they're going to be pushing these races all through the night\nTo try and influence the outcomes in California if you're a Republican you know live in one of these districts you must not give up your must vote\n\nYou must vote so a lot of important races in California\nThey got a big race for governor in Oregon they might actually get a Republican governor the first one in forty years can you imagine that but there's big races all over the country look in my state become a wealth of Virginia we've got Dave Brat\nSo what they did the Democrats just they've found a former CIA employee who is a left wing cook\n\nBut she keeps campaigning on the fact that she's a former CIA employee\n\nBecause the left this many of them trying to cover their trail they can try and cover what they really are and who they really are she will vote to impeach the president of the United states and Dave Brat as a member of the Freedom Caucus is crucially important that's an important race we're\nBarbara Comstock in northern Virginia she's the only Republican left in northern Virginia she's it and she's being targeted by the gun control crowd Bloomberg she's being targeted by a pillow see pack and all the left this they want to take her down\nOf course conservatives have been disappointed with summer her positions\nBut the choices between her and the biggest tax or have ... in modern times in the state Senate origin Waxman who also voted to impeach Trump so I urge my love and I said these different districts that turned out\nAnd vote for Comstock and the vote for some of these other candidates you need some of these rhinos in order to win this isn't what your clean out the Ryan budget clean out the rhinos in Republican primaries\nWhat we have certain candidates in New York New Jersey and the Supreme Court a Pennsylvania controlled by the Democrats you know what they did these low down finally justice is\nNot too long ago a few months ago they completely ... district in this state but Democrats which may in fact\nIf you don't turn out all over the country including in Pennsylvania hand the house of the Democratic party this was what goes on with these Obama judges this is what goes on with the Democrat dredges that needs to various state Supreme Court that Supreme Court gerrymandered that congressional districts in Pennsylvania it out but Democrats [noise]\nI'll be right back with a tremendous gas [noise]\nFor years I've been sleeping on my Casper mattress\nI mean let's face it under the ... Obama era they tried to put a lot of organized for profit businesses out of work and certainly they went after fossil fuels I stood up and I said no to that nonsense when I saw those lawsuits and President Trump well\nHe's just finishing the job I was basically the bridge to President Trump who's done so many great things for our economy and for energy jobs in West Virginia we need to continue that approach of lowering our taxes and then ultimately deregulating\nSo that regulations fulfill a more basic purpose\nMarkets you know were meant to be a free people that means we should try to solve most of our problems either individually or within our communities on the local level when you have federal regulations in place there has to be a very compelling health\nSafety well for aspect to it and it obviously must comply with the constitution and that's part of the problem with the rock Obama era or they went so far beyond the pale\nPresident Trump is doing it right and we know unfortunately Joe mansion his first vote and the U.S said it would have power Schumer and that radical team that was on full display of obstruction and resistance during the judge Kavanaugh nomination\nAnd the people of West Virginia [noise] they need to understand that when Hillary Clinton and her bunch talked about deplorable they're talking about people hardworking men and women blue collar men and women like the wonderful citizens\nOf West Virginia told me one of the Democrats done in the last forty years for coal miners I Can't think of a single thing other than trying to put them out of work\nA look I think the biggest thing is when you of a presidential nominee who says we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work\nYou might be able to say oops and try to take it back but the people West Virginia don't forget that's one of the major reasons why Joe mansions going down that is true self through the fact is that Joe mansion vice\nPresident Pence said it right he's there when you don't need him he's never going to lead and he's certainly not going to stand together with President Trump\nAnd that's why more and more people as they're examining the contrast between my campaign\nAnd Joe mansion coming over to our side that's why we're tied or maybe I'll buy one and the latest poll we feel very good but I have to tell you um are we have to get the word out because Chuck Schumer and the coastal elites Bloomberg and Soros and all these radicals they're coming in and they're spending\nUnbelievable money we think it's going to be over twenty five million West Virginia most expensive state in the country per capita in the Senate election\nA Patrick Morrisey if America wants to donate to your campaign if the people of West Virginia want to turn out and supported the grassroots level what is your website\nOr our website is Patrick Morrisey dot com and that's to ours and want to ask and folks consider donating twenty five dollars right now you'd make a difference we know that Schumer the other day just dumped seven hundred thousand more money in\nThe Democratic Senatorial Committee put a couple of hundred born today we're fighting like back in the arena and we're going to win but you know how we're going to win or you know went through these grassroots patriots that are listening to you mark\nUp people care about

buddy Patrick Morrisey dot com to ours want to ask\nAnd please twenty five dollars here twenty five dollars there the limits twenty seven hundred we need to fight that Schumer mansion Clinton team or because they've got the money but we've got the heart and we have a Trump Card\nAnd you know what if we can't get two Republican senators out of West Virginia to give him with the Democrats have done to your state it's going to be very very tough so uh I Hope the folks in West Virginia understand what man she comes home and he smiles and he shakes hands any\nAny kind of doesn't Lincoln and not about the liberals and congressman somewhere he votes with them Ninety eight percent of the time so I'm\nA and all these big votes you gotta sit recklessly on the edge of your chair and wonder if he's going to come through or not is he's trying to figure out what is best for his his political career I assume Patrick you're going to take a leading role defending your stay you're going to take a leading role as a conservative\nWe are mark and and I appreciate you saying that as attorney general we helped lead a lot of these national challenges\nWe stood against illegal amnesty and we were very strong we took on that rock Obama EPA time after time\nLook we say no to this PC nonsense that comes out of a laugh I mean what they did is absolutely outrageous and anyone who says that Joe mansion ... only voted for cabinet or they have to look back at one point do you know that all of the shenanigans and the obstruction resistant circus that we saw could have been avoided\nIf Joe mansion it's stepped out earlier instead of taking a powder when they called his name first so that he could wait for the state of Maine Susan Collins to cast the deciding vote that's a profound cowardice and that's not going to be my approach I'm the exact opposite\nAll right Patrick Morrisey I Wish you all the best I obviously support your effort very very strongly and give out your Web site again so America can try and help you hear\nWell thank you it's Patrick Morrisey dot com and that's to ours and want to ask and once again if you donate twenty five dollars or a hundred dollars

him when he has a backbone standing up to threats to our country that is how we protect ourselves a next generation that's how we protect our freedoms and liberties and I'll tell you as an army reservist I Know\nThat if I was ever sent into harm's way I Would be sent to win or not sent that all where we've had conflicts in the past where we sent our troops in harm's way and we set them up to fail\nSo I feel good as as a U.S citizen and with with where we are national security as a member of Congress and also someone who actually just got selected last week for promotion lieutenant colonel wow they'll probably serving in are in the reserves as well uh there are many ways to serve\nAnd I uh it's a privilege to be able to to wear the uniform that that uniform actually feels or even better than the suit that you were done in Congress\nWell congratulations on that now let me ask you this ah the president also wants to fight illegal immigration he wants better vetting there's an image Thirteen problem on Long Island isn't there\n... absolutely and MS Thirteen is now being defeated the president is confronting that the the threat head on and we saw it with the threat of radical Islamic extremism you cannot defeat a threat you're not willing to identify\nThis president gets heat for calling MS Thirteen animals they are animals he's come up to Long Island multiple times\nWe've had members have been missed his administration\nAll in working with local law enforcement and it's not just about combating MS Thirteen it's the it's the sex trafficking the drug trafficking human trafficking so it's protecting public safety not just the high profile murder that everyone in the country will hear about it's also this administration rescuing\n... that the women who are stuck in that sex brothel in that town within my district where they're being used as as slaves having sex all day long so the administration is is protecting all these people who are who are being victimized by the crimes and the way that MS Thirteen supports itself\nI my opponent is one of those people who say that we need to you know he supports a sanctuary city policies of\nCutting off all coordination and cooperation between Eisner local forces\nAnd let me just stop you there and so the American people in your district understand what that means that means that after he criminal illegal alien has served their sentence in an American prison\nThat they will not work with my spaghetti detain or for the feds to pick up that person and deport them that person is released into the community\nRight totally you're cutting off coordination and cooperation and you're not you're not telling ice\nThat you have someone that you're about to release them into the community you're actually working against the ice where the Oakland Mayor is everybody a heads up that ISIS calming where we had in New York we have all sorts of sanctuary city policies county ... and even state policies have Andrew Cuomo and\nThe Democrats were to have full control of Albany come January ah so yeah it's it's really concerning because actually the maximum amount of cooperation is how to keep my constituents safe not cutting off cooperation with ice and I'll take our ice agents they're amazing our governor calls are ice agents thugs he says America has never been great\nOur ice agents they kiss their\nSons and daughters goodbye in the morning their spouse\nAnd they put themselves at great physical harm not just for their family at home for strangers as well we should be supporting them backing him up and the fact that people are getting rewarded with votes\nBy attacking ice attacking our law enforcement I don't know what's going on in this country [noise]\nYellen for Congress dot com Z.
