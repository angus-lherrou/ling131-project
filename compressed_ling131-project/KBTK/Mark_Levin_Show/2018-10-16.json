you\nKnow I don't know I don't just sounded good Bernie Sanders told me it was true\n\nThey're hypocrites there total fraud I remember running for office\nIn Maryland I Can't tell the story you know I used to go there there's a the the Maryland the Montgomery County fair and I'd sit Montgomery County or a very very liberal County Maryland\n[noise] I Would sit there at the fair in front of the G O P booth and shake hands with people and one day the staffer for Chris Van Hollen it used to be represented and now he's a senator from Maryland He stops and he's you know he knows who I Am so he's given me kind of the smart smart guy attitude\nAnd he starts getting it to me about ... no idea what he's talking about he doesn't have any grasp of the numbers at all he's completely clueless so I got tired of listening to it so I said don't listen I have a really simple question for you\nSince you believe government is is that good right and we should all transfer of wealth to a bunch of bow tie wearing bureaucrats in DC you don't give a crap about your money or anything else for that matter please explain to me that you think this is a net good for society and you should ask this of all you're liberal friends\nHow much money argued donating involuntarily higher tax payments to the government go\nHow much the answer I can almost a shore you with near certainty is Ciro matter of fact not only are they not turning over extra money they are hiring accountants to avoid paying the money they owe themselves to the government\nConservatives this is not a problem we are not hypocrites we know that government is full of waste we know the government can't spend money with any degree of efficiency so we do everything in our power to legally avoid giving the government any more money that we need to liberals make the exact opposite argument\nNow the government it's such a force for good the rich people should get more money to why why please explain to me how we have been paying into these anti poverty\nPrograms since the great society and sixty five in sixty six and the percentage of people not working in households with an eligible member of the work has gone up knocked down\nWe have not moved the poverty rate in any significant way at all it was actually going down before the great society and government intervention Phil Gramm had a great piece in the wall Street Journal about this last week it is now almost completely stabilize\nWe are transferring on average something like thirty thousand dollars in equivalent transfer payments over to people in lower income categories and the number of people working that are eligible family members the number of percentage of people are working has gone down in some of these households\nThe percentage of household with someone else would work that don't have anyone working has gone up dramatically please explain to me how this is evidence of government compassion effectiveness and efficiency pleased with a straight face try not to laugh\n\nWhile you simultaneously hire accountants like John Kerry and Hillary Clinton remember our real estate thing where they hired accountants to avoid paying extra taxes to the government why did you do that why\nIf the government is a source for net good things in society turn your money over to them don't be a phony but you can't if you're a liberal listening to the show doesn't that anger you that you're such a fake no serious that you're a fraud when you look in the mirror aren't you like wow I'm a real phony\nI Love the government do everything in my power to pay accounts to avoid giving the government money\nDoesn't that make you a fake how do you live like that no one serious\nI don't have that issue I look in the mirror go yeah the government really sucks patch I don't want to give them any more\nNo I'm Serious I don't have that issue\nI look in the mirror go yeah the government really sucks patch I don't want to give them any more my tax money I'm telling you outside of our military courts and the constitutional role of government where there's mass consensus they spent they waste money like no tomorrow government if states it's a disaster\nI have no issue with that\nI look in the mirror and old yep I Do everything legally I can to pay if your tax\nDollars as possible but not frauds\nYou don't pay extra you want me to pay more you don't do anything\nBecause you might say well than a couple of people do voluntarily Patrick I read a report and if the numbers are wrong tweed me I'm happy to hear\nBut I read a report a few years ago that the record amount of money the government and brought in up until that time involuntary tax payments voluntary meeting people just donate extra money the government you're never going to believe this number\nTwelve million dollars million billion certainly not trillion twelve million dollars\nWe have three hundred and thirty million people in this country\nAre you telling me if I say let's be generous I'll play down the number for the sake of making it easy on the liberal say there are thirty million liberals there's probably more than that probably caution forty or fifty who would classify themselves as liberals hey there's twenty five million if each of those liberals just donated a dollar to the government\nThe government they worship that they send you fly in front of that that they they almost consider an act of religion and faith if you just donated a dollar they would double the amount that voluntarily paid to the government a paltry twelve million dollars that's it\nSo lives step up stop being such frauds stop being such inauthentic fakes and frauds wake up tomorrow morning call your account and do the right thing\nAir quotes right thing because it's the wrong thing but you say it's the right thing right a big fat juicy check to the G\nGo do it call your account and come on five thousand ten thousand the government's a force for good baddie took\nThings took things take life did she\nGo had knock yourself out set an example for the conservatives out there you think are Neanderthals focus labs\nWe donated an astonishing hundred billion dollars involuntary tax payments [noise] nice job liberals dumb move but nice job at least you guys have a ... fine\nWe she stood for something your big frauds\nPhony phony fakes look\nYourself in the mirror and say I'm a big fake because you are\nI don't want to pay extra for everybody else does why why I give to charity I don't need someone else to do it\nI think that we we my wife and I give to charity we sell\nT shirts on our website we donate the money why I don't need anyone else to do it I don't look for other T shirt makers because we think we're helping somebody I don't need you to do
