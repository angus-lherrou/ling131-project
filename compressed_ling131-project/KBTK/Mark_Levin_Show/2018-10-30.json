Twitter Matt from Montana dot com you know I'm not\nI'm speaking for myself ... I'm not one of these guys who believes in contributing to the party I Believe in contributing to candidates folks when I'm putting these candidates on the program\nAnd putting their websites up on my side say hoped to give them as much support as you possibly can you have a lot of money flowing in ... Montana from the west coast in the east coast don't you\nAll my Lance Josh dressed or listen to this he\nIs the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyists in the nation\nWe've got one million people that reside in this\nDay just over one million people he's getting more contributions from lobbyists than Nancy Pelosi well you know it was forty million people in California is getting more contributions from lobbyist than Chuck Schumer has twenty million people in New York\nHow the world is a guy that represents a state with one million people end up becoming the number one\nRecipient of contributions from lobbyists and they said what kind of promises\nThat makes I I'll tell you oh you had to do is look at the uh how he treated Ronny Jackson admiral Ronny Jackson president puts him up for a nomination and Jon Tester comes out and releases a bunch of information that was proven to be false ruined the man's reputation\nOr what we say here is that Jon Tester invented a politics of character assassination and quite frankly Dianne Feinstein perfected it when she went after Brett Kavanaugh\nI Can't think of a single major issue we're Tester's been on the correct side I really can't so anyway I listen Matt what are the two or three big issues are that you're campaigning on\nAll the I Would say that three big things are going to be a the tax cuts that that Jon Tester voted against the big how important it is to have\nSomeone in there that's been a support constitutionally conservative a nomination to the Supreme Court\nAnd this immigration policy we have got to have somebody in there that is going to make sure that we get our border secure and the poor criminals and uphold the rule of law because John is just not there\nAnd testing them release program the amnesty the sanctuary city wow I I thought the heart left agenda he has completely embraced it\n[noise] and I suspect he would vote should our president or should we lose the house when they make a move to impeach him I suspect he be voting right there with Chuck Schumer to remove the president the United states\nThere's absolutely no doubt in my mind that that he would vote to remove our president he has again he is connected himself to the bar mental and the radical left\nUh that's another place where we really have a problem I mean we've got a lot of resources here in our state we have a lot of miners we have a lot of bloggers that are out of work right now mark and and John has just supported that environmental movement to the point that it makes it very difficult for these folks\nTo maintain these these industries in these jobs and they're good paying jobs\nCould support a family they can keep our our children here instead of exporting them all over the nation and he has has attach themselves to that movement to keep those jobs just a down and out in suppressing as they shut down basically the uh all but three commercial lumber mills that we had here in\nIn the [noise] [noise] well I Hope the people in Montana the good hardworking\nIndividual lists and Montana come out in droves and elect you to the Senate ah nah Rosendale we need their help we need your help a it's a very very important that we win the seat and taken away from this leftist tester who are\nWho travels Montana pretends he's something he's not just like some of these others do who are really I mean the Democrat Party is really hard core left now and I'm just hoping some uh some of the Democrats look at this and say you know what I I Know what's going on here and and I'm going to just change my vote this time so\nI Am aren't they got him out of them are I Hope some are mark\nI really do I mean I've had Democrats reaching out to be over the last thirty days or most definitely since the the obscene way that a justice Kavanaugh was treated and and they said they just cannot\nStick with that any longer there's one thing to vote against someone it's one thing to have an open dialogue but to destroy someone and their family in order to make an attempt to about retaining power the folks here just they find it unacceptable\nYes then you're right and it's meant for Montana dot com America if you can give them your support is another candidate we need to help get across the finish line as millions and millions are pouring in for his opponent tester from all over the country\nAnd all of you folks in Montana when election day or before you have early voting you do in Montana people need to get up to vote\nBased you do write weeks ago they started two weeks ago and we're of identifying voters and looks like it's trying to get our way so we're we're very very happy about that\nYeah but I just wanted to folks to know this is a a one two three point race and you don't want to you don't want to regret not having voted whether it's early voting on election day and say geez I could've made a difference\nI've seen a map some of these statewide races around believe they'll come down to eighty some votes or three\nSome of the statewide races are unbelievable come down to eighty some votes or three hundred so most we saw what took place in Florida in two thousand where\nIt came down to a few hundred votes in is a small population state big geographic state like Montana every vote really does count\nIt does get twelve events over the last three days mark\nAnd we're all over the state traveling around with Donald Trump junior and Kimberly guilt for oil and ran all we've had a lot of folks coming out and we tell everybody please\nGet your ballots
