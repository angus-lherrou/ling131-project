idea of ever given any one a lie detector test is and of course you know I'd be pleased Penn and teller an entertaining presentation of a of the information but it ... it checked out I mean they're they're really I didn't I entered the highlights that lie detector tests are not you can beat them yeah and it's it's not\nI mean it's it it it is not the end all be All right not to be what it is useful for a in certain circumstances\nIs the idea of a\nIntimidation right if\nYou were to say I'm going to give you a lie detector test you have to tell me the truth it's possible that the person tells you the truth because they're scared of the lie detector test All right um and that's where it's most useful it's\nNot to say that there's you know there's almost literally nothing behind I mean it does not tell you when you life not like there's no such thing there is no way to do that think about it and it's incredible and it's one of the things that I think most people take for granted if you pass a lie detector test you're telling the truth that it's not really the ... the way it works\nYou know yesterday we had Larry sharp on he's running for governor of New York now and you remember how he had these out of the box ideas you know they're like nobody's talking about that yeah I got an idea OK okay we administer sodium Penn is all\nTo a Ford\nKavanaugh and the entire committee mhm okay okay and then we just let the cameras were all this has nothing to do with getting the truth I just want to see it when I went to the\nMall or a bad I was doing that and I I did that last\nWeek yeah [laughter] uh it would you love to see\nThese guys because\nNobody is talking about fines Feinstein\nReally nobody in the media is despicable I mean the\nI don't want to just take one side because\nI'm not God so I don't know what happened I happen to believe Kavanaugh or a on Ford\nAnd most of that is because Ford has changed their testimony several times\nYear just ... there's nothing support it but\nMaybe she's telling the truth I don't know I'm not God\nSo if I have to put 'em in a room and choose one or the other I'm going to choose him because\nI don't think she has enough evidence for me to credibly say yeah he's a bad guy and even if I kind of believed her I still would ... there was a ... there that it's not on him you know he's not a not proven negative correct so I Hope he didn't do it um and I don't think she has proven that he did by any stretch out I don't mean beyond\nA shadow of a doubt I mean just a preponderance of evidence there is an inclination\nI mean I honestly I just want I Do not believe you did\nYour friend I don't need to not believe I don't either I'm now that's not to stay on as you point out we're not God even though they're pretty cool um so it's possible okay but I don't I don't believe that he did right so we've plow this field over and over and over again\nHow come nobody is plowing the field on how much they've destroyed her life Senator Feinstein has destroyed her life\nThey lied to her several times lied to her she requested anonymity they released a letter anyway causing a chain of events that would obviously reveal who she was um\n... obviously they lied to her about the Democrats are the Republicans\nShowed two co workers in\nReal tired real time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like Kavanaugh said the name cabinet even at\nThat time yeah but but but lives in I mean you I mean you don't have videotape well\nIt was yesterday or tape now we haven't seen it yet though uh-huh now there is allegedly videotape that exist somewhat of one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet\nI'm of course there's no video of the calving off thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the with the with\nThe ... and ... and we don't have that evidence yeah I mean we have a a ton of evidence and in fact I don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence and the forties so we I mean like we came out more I was like we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alice in case the however\nUm\nWhat's interesting about this\nIs that fifty six percent of Democrats believe Christine Blasey Ford's allegations fifty six percent only eight percent say they ... they believe Kavanaugh fifty six to eight\nIs a split there so you assume that if you ask people and it wasn't a partisan situation what do you think about the Alison situation do you what do you believe from her because she's got a more recent allegation she's actually brought it to the tension in real time to multiple people people around her have seen evidence of this there's text messages there\nIs a there are medical notes all the evidence that we just talked about there's an infinity amount times more evidence in the elephant case\nHe had only five percent of Democrats believe Allison's accuser we're told over and over again that women are to be believed it only five percent of Democrats believe the allegations\nAgainst Keith Ellison and here's\nWhy this is really important I'm just like I don't want an abuser on the Supreme Court\nIf if there was the amount of evidence on Kavanaugh but there is on a Keith Ellison I Would not be for Kavanaugh would you if there was a ... on ... no I wouldn't yeah I Would if if if the evidence was the same thing yeah what\n\nWe still have a standard here in this country um called innocent until proven guilty and preponderance of evidence is a slower is a lower level than that\nAnd I understand that um my issue here would be\nYou can once there isn't the Legal Center because people will say well this is just a job interview or this is just sitting in a legal proceeding once you have the absence of a legal standard you have to choose the standard you apply I Choose to apply a very high standard because people who are in relationships\nMany many times when he relationships to break up or someone feels jolted say things that are not true\nI having all that I agree I agree with you in this case\nI'm Keith Ellison should have the right to defend himself and he should\nWe should assume his innocence unless I agreed point in which he is and if especially with the case like this where it's very recent\nThat should just go through the legal system and when he comes out of he's guilty then he should get thrown out of that job and you can factor that in in your vote if you wish but I don't think he should lose any job because of this at this point he needs to you need to be able to see\nWhether this case goes through and and claims are proven someone had said they have video we need to see the video we see everyone\nA in investigated we need to see an actual police are investigation go through and and and the weather the evidence leads us to a belief that he actually committed these acts if we do not get that\nYou do not ruin people's lives over it I mean think about the amount of times of evidence that there is a key dealt in overall anymore which everyone I mean even at a lot of people in the right where like look ... really looked like he did these things his answers are really bad\n... you know there's much more evidence for he felt was more into was much more there's people you can interview right now yeah children who went through traumatic moments where they had to read about their mom being abused or you know sure her telling other friends at the time\nThat being said however you get when you went through this process where the presumption of innocence agree\nSo but what I Know about he fell assumes the evidence against him okay\nAssuming this was not current day and it was thirty five years ago if Ford would come with that evidence\nI have letters I have a photo of lead bruises on my arm I have um ah I can tell you where it happened I told my friends and\nHere they are they verify that I told them after the party ... would you not\nWould you not go okay I think that's good yeah I mean I think that would be enough and it was the only way we can judge the situation wrecked right correct here it is with Alison and again this is why it's important just like I don't want to have a Supreme Court justice that is an abuser or a liar or whatever\nI also think it's extraordinarily dangerous to have a guy who may have beaten his girlfriend may have mentally abused his girlfriend assuming the evidence\nIs real and checks out you can't have him as the as the the the chief law enforcement of the state\nAnd does anybody care no this shows you that nobody in the media\nCares and iota for this woman and her story they don't care if she was abused and they don't care about any of it what they care about stopping Brett Kavanaugh if they care they would be just as passionate as the guy was such a throw him out of it\nIt was abused and they don't care about any of it\nThey care about stopping Brett Kavanaugh\nIf they care they would be just as passionate as a guy was such a thrown out of the Minnesota attorney general this is a guy who was second in charge of the deep what they did in the audience see this is not a a a ... a peripheral figure in politics he's one of the most powerful Democrats in America and it's now going to be a chief law enforcement officer for state\nAnd you could say oh well it's all you're what you're doing is what about is um no no it's not it's not what about us and I apply the same standard to Allison that I applied to Kavanaugh\nYou weren't doing this to Canada I Would still be saying this about I'm I'm a about Alice\nYeah look and go back to why ... why was brought up on the president\nRight brought about was president because he won a presidential election in two thousand eight\nPreviously he made a heck of a speech\nAnd what two thousand four and a two thousand four ... election he won a Senate seat a Senate seat that would have been incredibly close if he was going against not Alan Keyes who they flew in the last week\nTo to start a campaign but it was a Jack Jack Ryan but it might be thinking of John ... at this point I'm trying to think too many Amazon commercials but uh Ryan was his last name and he was a legitimate challenger\nTo Brock Obama in that Senate race it was a close election and he may have won it\nAs a Republican in Illinois wow and what they did it they went through his divorce is sealed divorce ah I'm hearing and ... and paperwork\nOr out of it to the public and in there there were accusations by his wife the actress who said they went to swingers clubs and all this sort of shady stuff\nDo we know if that was true in added horse proceeding and the divorce proceeding people make all sorts of claims yeah and that's why you don't just believe that that's why there ... because they went and got them on the field in\nA democratic state and they they they ... Brian eventually dropped out there was no real opposition forever up a bomb and you've got eight years of him\nThat sort of thing should be always\nViewed skeptically every claim of a crime should be viewed skeptically by people on that side\nYou're supposed to give the presumption of innocence and close to start with skepticism of a claim on any side on any side on any side of all people who are accused and here we are in a situation where Democrats overwhelmingly believe the accusations against capital with almost no evidence and they\nFive percent of them believe the woman who is a Democrat who does not want someone of a ideologically opposed to ... to ... and to have that job she's a Democrat\nAnd only five percent of people believe her the the platitudes you hear from the media and the left mean nothing on the story they do not care about whether Ford was abused or not they don't [noise]\nAnd this shows you how fast that standard\nIs applied and how [noise]\nAnd how your life could be destroyed\nYou are on the wrong side of an issue and by the way\nI think you've seen\nThe issues change\nAnd positions what's politically correct changes and if you don't abide one hundred percent

to talk to investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads and when they don't find anything I'm like Bob Mueller face stop\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years in ... and found anybody still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop this\nSomebody on the Senate Judiciary committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start vouch for the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh\nSomebody needs to speak up for him somebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they have been thorough and they haven't found anything or you wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals but that's not happening\nWell but it is now late yesterday afternoon in the Senate floor here is the turtle\nOn top of its six crowd investigations of judge Kavanaugh them across the land of the

the same all the time for adolescent Elana structure has come to a close\n... nominations out of committee were considering it here on the floor and Mr President will be voting\nThis way late yesterday afternoon Mitch McConnell on the floor in the Senate and he got so much support for what he did yesterday\nAmazing how that happens isn't he heard from so many people what a great thing he went out and eat and then again he went out there again and he recycled they all Bill Clinton aligned to boot here's McConnell's from just for a couple of hours ago\nWhen judge Kavanaugh demonstrated is widely acknowledged brilliance\nOpen minded enough in college ... confirmation hearings some shows a darker rode the politics of personal destruction were willfully only after the FBI shares what they found senators will have the opportunity to vote\nWill have the opportunity to vote no on the politics of personal destruction will have the opportunity to vote yes\nOn U.S foreign nominate\nThat doesn't even touch what he did he went out there and he he didn't call these guys up by name but he quoted\nSome of the most outrageous why is that Democrats have been telling including members of the Judiciary Committee he pointed out their hypocrisy he pointed out their prevailing patients he pointed out their straight up and not live it was so good that it forced Chuck Schumer to go to the Florida we bought it\nIn check you out there and tried to make chicken salad when it was it was it was incredible listening to truck you I Believe Christine she was eminently credible judge Kavanaugh is not in the other way around\nWe have a life time of investigation of Brett Kavanaugh folks\nThere have been six now seven FBI investigations background checks\nWe have had more people looking into every nook and cranny and Britain Kevin O's life and we haven't even been gum to look at hers\n\nWere just assuming she's credible because that's the Democrats position on this\nThat they can go back and they can look at the anything Kevin ... done but she is off limits for something we can go and find out what she did it although beach parties we can't go out and find out what she did when she was out there skiing\nAnd surfing and flying around and do we [laughter] none of that's been done and yet he is credible and he isn't\nAnd now die by Dr biased ran into die by she was going someplace up on Capitol Hill a reporter said\nSenator Feinstein would have formed vote friday on Kavanaugh will be too soon\nRaw I Believe is I Believe it's just it's too soon not the case and ah [noise] it's when everybody agreed to\nOh by the way you don't look like I'm not saying this guy like\nThere's a part of me to think that he was in on this from the get go I there's a part of me thinks that he was not scared to death when he got harassment protested in the elevator there's part of me thinks he said because he hates Trump and that's what all this really is all it is aimed at people eating Trump and Kevin ... and the way\nIn order to get Trump they gotta get Kevin on the lake is out there saying you know what I um I I\nKevin wants to part of me I don't think we need other like wait a minute you said you're going to vote point friday morning flake\nAnd then you did\nFlake voted for Capitol after cleaning was going to vote for him now he's on the east too partisan for me I I don't know I
