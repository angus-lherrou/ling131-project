that town for more information\n[noise]\nYou're listening to the Glenn Beck program\nAcademic grievance studies and the corruption of scholarship part one introduction\nSomething has gone wrong in the university especially in certain fields within the humanities\nScholarship at base less up on finding truth and more upon attending to social grievances has become firmly established if not fully dominant within these fields and their scholars increasingly but bully students administrators and other departments into adhering to their world view\nSo Dr James Lindsey a along with a couple of other friends decided you know I let's find out what this is all about let's see what the lines are and they learned an awful lot ah they learn something\nA quite valuable that you just can't get away with anything you have to fall into a a set pattern really\nDr James Lindsey a is joining us now he is a thinker he's not a philosopher but he is a thinker which I like a doctorate in math or background or in physics uh James\nIs a thinker he's not a philosopher but he is a thinker which I like a doctorate in math or background or in physics uh James how are you sir\nGood Glenn how are you\nA good um so tell us what you were tell us what you were trying to do what were you trying to prove\nWell we were looking into these fields to find out whether or not their\nScholarship has gotten so kind of ideological bias\nThat if we put forth I'm really absurd arguments or that they might you be willing to publish though so long as they've solved fell in line with the political views that they seem to be forwarding and plays a scholarship\nSo that first you didn't you didn't really understand the political view part right because the first few the studies that you've you submitted a you got back they were rejected\nYeah um well it's not quite that actually we I think we understood the political view but we didn't understand the need for a scholarship we started this project out and as you said we got the first several papers\nAre back rejected we started in August by Thanksgiving everyone would literally Thanksgiving a day off or we really realized we were in trouble um we weren't getting anywhere with trying to host them but the problem wasn't we didn't understand the politics so much although there's still a lot to learn there and there was for us to a very complicated\nThey call it a matrix of domination that you have to understand\nUm but it was more that we actually we're not trying to work their scholarship and so there are two things that are needed\nTo to get these papers and one is that you actually have to understand what they call scholarship you have to do it according to their rules you you have to understand the concepts you're working with and present them knowledgeably and then\nDon't be confused or misled the original owners of logistic mow the lawn South Mountain are no longer affiliated with that convenience store\nNow

how you guys came up with these are but they're fantastic oh let's go through some of them one by one let's start with the first one dog park\nThe or the thesis is dog parks are re rape condoning spaces tell me about ... tell me about it\nWhat kind of funny actually um I tell ya story um when I went to we we all got together to to have this kind of like as best we could so I went to Portland we all went to Portland, Oregon\nToo I'm getting ready for this project to come out publicly went to the dog park on the first day I got there almost right I got off the plane I took an over next thing you know I'm walking\nPeters out there for the dog park with our\nFilmmaker and uh we get to the dog park and there's this this dog they're living out the paper it was crazy this dog was fighting the other dog's hunting them down housing them left right and center the owner comes over ...\nThe things the ball thrower at the dog gently I'll point out it wasn't being abusive and then stop hunting and then we get to as a lean over to the filmmaker\nOr if the dog gently I'll point out he wasn't being abusive and then he says stop hunting\nAnd then we get to as a lean over to the filmmaker and kind of murder I guess a little too loudly and maybe we should start interrogating people about their sexuality given much is going down here and then this lady yells out to me oh no no it's okay she's the girl dog and I was like oh man this papers happening for real\n[laughter] so what is what is the thesis\nSays the thesis was all the original idea behind the thesis was that we should write a feminist paper arguing that we should train ... and the way that we train\nDogs to prevent rape culture and so I thought that they thought it was pretty funny when I was brainstorming ideas for papers sure to Peter Peter takes his dog the dog park every day\nI'm ... said let's work and some of the stuff from the dog park and as we started working and just you know absolutely absurd ideas from\nWhat might be considered the most ridiculous dog park in the world or the paper grew into that and so we made it about\nSo called queer performer pivotal in human reactions at the park\nAnd then ended up concluding things like the ... we we should be able to leash man likely least dogs ... to prevent rape except if not politically feasible and\nUh gosh it would be great if we could could put shocked colors on men but that's not okay either so\nWe have to shock them out of you know hitting on women by screaming at them to scare them and it gets them to desist from their behavior we the thesis of the paper was though that that humans\nReacted differently to gauge dog hunting as opposed to stray dog hunting and men were far worse about this than women\nAnd then we concluded that this is indicative of\nRace culture and we called the dog park rape condoning\nA St Louis and while he came to to nightclubs we said ... night clubs are also rape condoning spaces with no evidence for that whatsoever\nWhen I'm\n... so that was pretty out there um that one was was really out there I think it's I don't know maybe the one about the the feminist spiritual spirituality meetings and poetry is a little more out there but it's probably close to the most\nWell LOU LOU finished the dog park this one was accepted and reviewed uh some of the reviews is a wonderful paper incredibly innovative rich and analysis is extremely well written in organized\nA yadda yadda I Believe this ah intellectually and imperial ... exciting paper must be published and congratulated the author on the research done and in the writer\nAnd in the right yeah\nYeah that was the most disturbing parts of this I feel like because the ... again it wasn't like these ... these journals looked at this and didn't really go through it and kind of just ... it made its way through the process there are very specific comments from dozens\nOf reviewers who are on the ... who are doing peer review in saying specific things that you wrote that are completely ridiculous are amazing new accomplishments in the field I mean that had to be wild funny and improved your point had to be really disturbing as well\nOh yeah that is by far what we consider to be the most important evidence that we gathered in the process of of this project that the papers got published or that they got awards in some cases are one case and all of this is fine I says a lot in his disturbing but the reviewers comments shows that they use\n... peer reviewers which it worked out between two and four or five or paper so we ended up with something like forty five or fifty total a set of comments they they really did engage with what we did they really looked at it they ... ...\nSet our analysis was good ones are analysis was terrible they didn't raise an eyebrow about the data we gather the idea that um you know the dog park paper contains\nA bit of completely irrelevant evidence about were dogs go to the bathroom and unauthorized ways as we were to that and it's completely irrelevant to the paper but nobody raise an eyebrow about how ridiculous that is um they were concerned however that we\nIndicate that we're human not dogs so that we can be sure that we don't claim that when a dog there was a ... ... thing of another dog whether or not the dog they go home to want it or not because how could we know that as\nBeing ... and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little\nVideo we've put out to announce that project they're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals um\n[noise] and when I went out and so what what\nSpecifically were they concerned about I mean the ... ... what I mean\nYou got me man\n[laughter] and then it was done in the privacy of a of a veterinary office [laughter] okay\nUm let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nAre the the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building is a category in which fat is displayed politically so that fat as just considered another to issue a that equal with muscle\nAnd to say that that's not true is to be mean to fat people pat phobic as they call it\n... and that was accepted\nYeah that was expected that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar lettuce uses identity who wrote that who we claimed wrote that paper and he actually has a professional body builder or Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something that I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind of this guy being the author of this\nPaper for fat body building was just kind of hilarious\nBecause that's another thing to do a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean it some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking would it would it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean this kind of a is this is a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship could stand or fall on its merit not on who did it and so a\nHim interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was the question\n\nWhat if this were published and they were real if this were published ... ... what would that\nMean to the university system would would what does that mean\nSo the all events is a really complicated I'm\nThere will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at the University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some are educators primarily working in social justice side or the fields topics\nCourses I guess that's the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to\nThe gold standard journal this wasn't some fringe journal in education this was a gold entered tennis philosophy journal ... that we were working with here\nWhich is where a lot of the literature that like this already exists which if you don't mind me going on a little bit this this kind of what's happening\nI'm we think that what's happening here is the equivalent with ideas of money laundering called idea laundry oh\nSo they take they take these these bad ideas some of which are just opinion some of them are prejudice some of them are genuinely terrifying like this educational thing and then they launder them through the academic process and they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge\nSo you'll hear people say oh well there was a study or rebates this program on studies that show well that's fine when the studies or could but when the studies\nAre coming from a place they can't tell\nA truth from from prejudiced and opinion it becomes a real problem\nJames one of the other ones they've found um disturbing or was the uh H. O. H. two ...\nTwo was was accepted can you explain it explained this one yeah\nThat paper was accepted by high pay showed the singer and I was just mentioning that paycheck away stood for hosts on hoaxes so it was a hoax paper we wrote that was a ballot writing academic hoaxes that code namely gay for convenience what it argues is that that you can\nOnly properly criticize things that go against social justice in particular you can only use humor to make fun of or or do satire to deflate\nThat which goes against social justice if you use humor against social justice if you criticize both will drop that what that means as you never really properly engaged with it therefore we don't have to consider your criticism and that's one of the huge problems going on in this this set of of\nFields is that they don't accept criticism if you tried to criticize them they say that it's a privilege preserving epidemic pushback that a scholar named Allison Bailey huge\nIn the education literature they say it's white fragility that's Robin to Angelo who has just had a big book published on that this year but it introduced the concept in twenty eleven which says that if\nI'm somebody was privilege in particular white people for her work uh is challenged so that their privileges Clinton question that they are fragile and don't know how to deal with it because of privilege made them weak they don't know how to psychologically deal with having that challenge and they act out in anger or grief or something like that\nAnd trying to maintain their privilege and so\nThese ideas are already getting out there we just took him to step further\nThan it is interesting guy because the one about health and is it is interesting and that is to criticize what you guys did\nThey would almost half just cite your paper as that was\nThe idea yeah and it was definitely to put them in that position and I've asked ... to stand by the paper that they accept it and publish in our right names\nThey haven't responded yet but we'll see what they do I'm that way indeed people who want to criticize our project from a position of interest like an old feminist them will need to cite off in order to criticize us\n[laughter] I can we get one more ... on the ... you talked about this kind of scary front at the feminist mine comes a\nWell you also did the white man my income you did to one time and this was accepted in the white man wasn't right\nCorrect film Iraq tell me about them\nSo I'll do though the white one first because they didn't get in it was much more frightening it was written in from the position of an auto West Nile graffiti where the researcher is reflecting on an effort to states her own experience\nAs a white lesbian women coming to hate her own white mass and it was rejected partly because the scholarship wasn't quite er which is the case in all of the papers but also because the position is the author as a good white rather than being sufficiently ... or whatever to critical race ...\n... so there was there was an explicitly political reasoning behind why it was was rejected and it was that the the author as a white woman was trying to make herself look good by criticizing her own white was was one of the main reason the feminist one was\nWell hold on just a second hold on just saying that took mind the parts of mine Tom where he was talking about Jews and replace the word Jews\nWith ah with whites\nIn that case it was either whites are white and this and then we edited the text around it and added a whole a whole bunch of literature and rewarded thing so\nYeah in that case it was either whites are white and this and then we edited the text around it an added a whole bunch of literature and rewarded things get passed plagiarism check and things like that so yeah that was a bit started with scanning through mine comp\nPicking out passages about the Jews and replacing Jews with whites are white miss\n... than editing around it uh the feminist one didn't do it quite the same way as soon as one was not about it didn't take Jews out and replace\nIt with with men for example it actually has the chapter in my income where Hitler explains the need for the Nazi Party\nIs chapter twelve and what its members would be expected to a whole to and including especially the sacrifices that they have to make to the Nazis and we were placed\nOr movement party et cetera he doesn't mention Nazis specifically in that chapter or we replace that with intersection of feminism or solidarity or ally ... something to do with with the feminist movement and criticize the idea that\nA feminist do what they called choice feminism which is the idea that if a woman is living her own life the way she wants to and considers that to be a statement of feminism than she is doing feminism salmon is for women to have you know full agency and make their own choices in the world that's what this paper was criticizing\nSaying that no no they're responsibility if they really want to consider themselves feminists is to be to make sacrifices and stand in solidarity with other oppressed people particularly of you know women of color or women of other marginalized status is\nJames [noise] couple of quick questions um hey\nThis had to be one of those things that you entered into and hoped that you were wrong in when they were accepted you had to celebrate and then short time later going\nGood God this is bad and my right\nTo that is exactly right so especially the ... paper I think the one that got accepted um the idea there was that we were trying to it's very different from mine off of course do I mean as you are one to one thing uh\nBut the ... the politics of grievance through I really am glad I get to talk to you about that I can\nBecause all it takes the grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic laughed as we were trying to demonstrate we called this stuff grievance he's we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided\nA politically right now I was really happy to talk to you because I mean I don't want to get in touch with you but you're real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this whole May of ... about\nHow things were going to under Obama's time and I thought that was huge and I was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge she's looking for reconciliation it's on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again\nSo our project was you know or people on the left were left liberals I'm not ashamed to say that I Know you consider yourself a classical liberal and conservative on the right that's great\nUm we on the left me to take responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that you know we're in a left wing people who want the left to come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all START I think you know people\nGeneral I get a lot of sense that people send me emails about this now all the time especially um\nWe're all kind of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to production politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this ... stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media sphere as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't\n... remember you know you

real things look very bad for Republicans\nUm it's interesting the way that they're looking at this is not whether usually it's like will will will the party loser gain seats right that's the way we usually typically look at these things and then there's that control angle as well who will control the house\nWell even notice you haven't heard a lot of talk about whether Republicans will will didn't gain any seats\nLargely because it looks like it's not even possible at this point in fact um the the polling models that they have working right now uh five thirty eight has one which they have um the I the chance of Republicans can maintain their current amount of sleep at less than zero point one percent\nAnd you might say oh well they've gotten you know there was issues with dating and Trump right which is I think every time I talk about polls were like oh well they didn't get Trump right well first of all the national polls are almost exactly Don for Donald Trump\nOr it just didn't get the ah electoral college right but that also wasn't what they were pulling and write some of the states were were obviously wrong but for example uh five thirty I Believe had about thirty percent chance that they thought Donald Trump or when they're saying there was a point one percent less than a point one percent chance that the Republicans will maintain the same amount of houses\nAre seats in the house in fact they're saying the\nEqual chance that Republicans to maintain the same amount of seats as Democrats gaining eighty three the\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the N word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland but they have a a a law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt stuff started breeding\nKicking\nBurning flags whatever\nThat's pretty scary and and the mayor release a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I don't\nI mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we want to make it any worse he's trying\nTo make it sound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right but they act and they're just so they don't act and their do nothing\nSo they have no way to win a great observation there are two political parties and whatever you do one of them might criticize you\nYes that is that the job of being married right out of your job of being a leader supposed to actually have an idea and do something and which I think he did by the way I think you're right what did you not age because to me right when you say for public consumption that is exactly what he's doing yes his his opinion is oh jeez where we're damned if we do damned if we don't\nBut in reality what he wants is a is much more on this side\nBut you have a fully know much more on the side and you can back that up with how he reacted to the FBI the FBI building in Portland is\n... is under siege for ... to ... I mean think of the balls on these guys\nThey take the FBI building and block it off so FBI agents are are now trapped inside the building they call for police police say a we've got a call the mayor why\nI'm calling you dispatch police we have to call the mayor the mayor goes on and says if the FBI thinks that this city is going to back them up there in the wrong city\n... excuse me what what ...\nSo the FBI had to get federal officers to come in and get everybody out of that building and into safety\nSounded nothing Portland did nothing to these guys that I mean whoa what is this\nIs a I mean it's it's close to anarchy right it's certainly the way that that you think it would come if it does it say you know the idea that you the FBI can't depend on police officer forget the FBI just these are people are these are actual real individuals who are in danger or and\nThat was a woman who has the food carts across the street from the FBI um she was a a threatened with an inch of her life I think they've had to move out of the city or in your family um they took her stuff destroyed it or threatened the neighbors who are coming down trying to you know stick up for\nI mean they're just that they've become animals they become animals and their claim these are they're streets no they're not they're not punk have you paid for them\nBecause I think a lot of the people who are trying to make it to work are the ones who actually paid for it your streets since when but read enough history\nUsually people are who are um you know national socialists or more\nRead enough history usually people are who are um\nYou know national socialist or Marxist radicals of some sort of they were in power and they let this they let this stuff go until the people have had enough\nAnd then they do what they want with those people and they you know use those people as cover to seize even more power that's the way it works on a national scale I have no idea what this Portland mayor is doing\nBut it's insane\nMeanwhile Alex ... Alec Baldwin who uh has a new show on\nWhere where's this new show starting to you know uh I don't trust the top of my head I think it's yeah it's got a new show ABC I mean until it ABC jeez yeah so

basically I Would have some laughs or we're going to be out on our a tour addicted outrage tour a theater near you all you have to do is find out where and when it's Glenn Beck dot com slash tour\nUm he said uh the illness made him realize he needed to make a change in his life\nI spent a good time a good deal of time with people who aren't so lucky and this is terrible news came I realized I wasn't really having fun in the music business I'd lost the joy and at some point just before the Brits I was starting to lose the plot\nI become desperate to hold on to something I thought I might be losing and I thought I had to do something special to keep it\nI started doing things out of my comfort zone like presenting the truth is it had been a while since I had been having fun it started I started to worry about ticket sales for my tours\nWhat the critics said what the perception of bite me might be I felt like I was living with this over my face and near ... and the reality I was seeing was old blurred by it\nI decided I never wanted to read my name and print again never read a review and I never have I decided I'd never use social media again and I never have but the diagnosis made me realize how stupid I had been to worry about all of these unimportant things I was embarrassed by my ego\nI was embarrassed that has allowed this in security\nI realize that for many years I couldn't believe I was on the same stage as my heroes I couldn't believe I was looking cross somebody like Paul McCartney and saying things like it's hard to get here but my God it's harder to stay here\nThen I woke up and sought after ten years of trying to get here in five years of being scared that it would go away I think I can enjoy it\nAfter his son's illness he says I just don't have the stomach for it anymore the celebrity narcissism it started I started to crumble but then I started to wonder why I wanted to do it in the first place\nI had forgotten that it was all about souls connecting because I become so anxious there were people in my business life saying if you hadn't done this or that if you've written a better song tickets might be selling quicker I started to take all of that on board and no one wanted to take any responsibility\nIs just so much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was insecure enough already I Would digested and say it's my fault time rubbish it affected me and I started to think it's all going to go I'm going to lose everything\nIt is\nFascinating to read these things from him because what I've always felt about Michael boob lay was she was just having fun\nHe was just living a dream and I wondered and I never spotted him I just wondered\nIf it was ever going to get old to him because what makes him I think the best performer I've ever seen on stage is that joy he just has a joy of performance and it is it is so infectious\nYeah he loves it I mean you can tell when you see him live you can tell he just absolutely loves doing it or at least it at one point um but they're starting to talk about I mean there's conflicting reports that he's actually thinking about stopping it\nCompletely he says I was learning with passion that I was afraid I'd become a mere poor photo copy of my heroes\nBut when I come back from this terrible time I realized I'm not a mere photocopy of learned everything I can from them taking it found my own soul my own voice in my own style and now no credit can take that away\nIt needed clarifying now I'm just seeing the music I Love maybe when you let go that's when it comes back to you it's a lot like love\nHe is um he he I think he's joking about he because he says I miss the guys in my band so when my wife had to go back to Argentina I said to the guys come on over to the house let's have a drink orders a pizza place in video games and jam\nThey came over and we partied and I said let's play some music and I thought wow\nThis is fun it was then that I realized that I missed making music I didn't even know I missed it that was about a year ago so why would he possibly be saying that he is now\nIt seems like it might be one of those situations where the Internet has taken a somewhat a sarcastic comment and turn it into reality has is focused people are coming out saying saying that he's not actually going to retire because he's in the middle of a tour in a book or their album released and all that\nOther stuff so here's what he here's what he says exactly to the reporter\nHe pauses there are three reasons I wanted to do this album one because I felt a debt of gratitude deeper than I can explain to the millions of people all over the world who pray for us and showed us compassion that gave me faith in humanity\nTo because I Love music and I feel I can continue the legacy of my idols and three because of the world was ending not just my own personal hell but watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe breakup there's\nNever a better time for music then he suddenly stops quote this is my last interview he says quite solidly I'm\nRetiring from the business of made the perfect record and now I can leave it at the very top end quote somehow though the writer says I don't think he really means it\nIt's unbelievable because you know that it was put all over the media as if he was retiring well he said it was his last interview he got other interviews scheduled\nRight like he's had a whole pressed for for the album is just silly and most important thing though is is looking at that and saying that is really the type of thing that ... that changes your perspective completely right you go through something like that and you stop and you examine all the nonsensical idiocy that you you participate in every day\nUh and you can re prioritize you don't want to have to go through that to do it but sometimes it's the only thing that makes you kind of re prioritize the things you're doing in your life\nUh and and he seems to have I mean he he is making thirty five million dollars a year if he's out there a touring and stuff and he's able to walk away from that\nBecause he just wants to spend time with his son how many times do we hear those excuses I'm so according to what is more time with my family that was completely real guy yeah it's nice to see somebody who actually\nTimes you hear all those excuses I'm Still quite a novelist and more time with my family that was completely real guy yeah it's nice to see somebody who actually you know and it's nice to see that he\nHe got through it and has made it into a good thing you know I I have I have\n... probably more respect for Michael who play than any other professional that I've ever met in the entertainment industry\nBecause he has found a way to keep his feet on the ground and he was afraid I mean when everybody when everyone it was very popular to hate me\nHe didn't but I mean no ... hit you know but he but he and he was never taking a stand for me he just wouldn't he just didn't understand him and he's like\nLook I'm I'm not in politics I'm Canadian why\nDo I care until you get out of it and then you get a fight at a ... yeah he said the guy turned around and said I could leave you look back and he's like I'm Canadian I don't vote what do you what does it matter [laughter] isn't that or to you\nAnd the guy's real ... and he said I wrote punches back and he's like how they're doing I got to do a hockey fight [laughter] you got to do a hockey fight [laughter] I Am so happy\nTo hear that his ah family is um is doing better and his son has made this miraculous turn\nAnd ah Michael ... you've given enough if you want to give more we will certainly take it but uh do what's right for you do what's right for you and
