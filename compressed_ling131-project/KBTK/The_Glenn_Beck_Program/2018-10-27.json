true in the next ten years we're in deep trouble\n[noise] we're headed toward a really interesting time in human history ... scary and fascinating\nYou're in deep trouble [noise]\nWe're headed toward a really interesting time in human history and it's scary and fascinating so somebody some people shorthand for this ... of the economy I think the simpler way to think about it is just um\nThe average duration of people's jobs or their relationship at a firm is going to get shorter than ever before in human history so let's go macro for a minute hunter gatherers throughout most of human history\nYou don't have any conception of what your job is you pursue that buffalo\nRight and then ten thousand years ago people settled down and started\nPlanting and harvesting and we we enter farm on a on a regular cycle and from ten thousand years ago to hundred and fifty years ago nobody had job choice they just did with grandma and grandpa mom and dad and aunts and uncles had ever had done forever eternity past with the industrial revolution we get jobs specialization and it was really disruptive\nBut when people took a job they still kept it till death of retirement not everybody graduated high school at the beginning of the industrial revolution by the end almost everybody does\nBut you still get one job but sometime between Fifteen and twenty two years old and you keep it for all of your life I was born in the Nineteen seventies average duration at a farm for a primary breadwinner then it was still twenty six years now it's four years and getting shorter and it's got to get shorter forever more\nMcKenzie a farm I used to work with believes that fifty percent of the American labor market by three years from now this is not Twenty years in the future three years from now they think fifty percent of the labor market will be primarily freelancers\nMeaning that most people will cobble together a bunch of different jobs not all of them are going to be ap enabled tech jobs like being a new driver with the right software that makes you more efficient than an old school Gabby but what's really going to happen is we're going to head toward a world where\nPeople are going to get disrupted out of their jobs at aged forty and forty five and fifty and fifty five forever more\nWe've never ever done that in human history and so it means all of the banks of what's often called now the quarter life crisis\nThe sort of late adolescence crisis of trying to figure out your your role in life and how do you go from just being a consumer and mom and dad's house to be in a producer that can not just put bread on the table for your kids but can actually have a sense of meaning that you're serving your neighbor that disruption that most people know in late adolescence working experience that again every three to five years for our whole life\nAnd that means there's a lot of new potential for upheaval and frankly for unhappiness there's going to be more economic output\nThan it's ever been produced before in human history\nBut it's not at all clear that it will redound to the median family in the median household and the media and worker or going to have to become a civilization of lifelong workers able to get retrained when you're forty nobody's ever done that before\nOkay so there's about an hour of questions on on that one uh but I've got about three minutes left can you give me\nA ... your take on the first real political upheaval that we're going to see them I think by twenty twenty you could change everything could start global wars deep thanks\nYeah so one of the reasons I wrote them is because I spent a lot of time on intelligence issues and I'm In the intel community there are people who talk about the perfect storm of deep fakes that we have coming and the storm is these three ingredients number one\nNew technology makes it possible to sort of narrow cast a world with fake audio and fake video where lots of people can be susceptible to\nBeing sort of um a\nSpoof or persuaded the things that are real are real there's always been enemies doing malicious actor you know information warfare since the beginning of time you can find it and ... and ... to sow discord in an enemies tent but it used to require a prostitute honey trap that affect business partner in a bribery scheme\nAnd more right you had to get people around people number one\nIs now we can use technology to surround someone and give them a fake experience and ... are fake audio and fake video\nThat are going to seem real I can make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad at it the real reason we need to take the Russia type investigation so seriously as because China's right behind them running scout\nTeam off since I'm On them and ready to do\nBig deep fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and business officials and the public at large and number three we have so many internal divisions about geography about race about gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided\nThat we are susceptible to these kind of campaigns like Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they\nTry to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL kneeling controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media and the first Seventy two hours after that flamed last fall\nThe majority of it on both sides stand for the anthem and taking the NFL most of it was Russian on both sides and so we're going to have a world where you're going to have things like the cabinet hearings where all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer's strategizing with Michael ... or video will appear it'll be fake\nBut video will appear and it'll be Kavanaugh partying hard as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake\nBut in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be a potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them\nA why we hate each other is an awareness that there's actually national security exposures for this country and how much we hate each other around politics we need communities of people that live in the same neighborhood believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise]\n[noise] how come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\n[noise] ah it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some nut job somewhere in a McDonald's right now who probably slap to an old man wearing a mock a hat and or\nThat person is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of ...\nPecking and so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but that's the that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have well we've got thirty seconds I'm not getting even ask you I'm not even ask you I Would like to ask you to come down a Ben and and really unpack this uh because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood and I think in soundbites\nUm it's not a not always understood I'm so thank you very much\nAnd you say she's she's advocating socialism not ... not Canadian socialism socialism communism she's talking about state run and owned property in businesses now that's that's not a welfare state\nOh you're a conspiracy theorists weight she\nJust said it at one point [laughter] oh I mean first of all the you know the press is a collection of individuals some of which do a good job some of which do not\nAh so it's important to make those distinctions I think um and you know look at that is a this was just this is going on at our founding you know people were doing it at our founding an end it at our founding but we but we we realize is when we were in a gauge and informed populace we chose correctly\nRight I mean I you know if we're not\nWell we know what the ... which we know a a republic if you can keep it right and if we if we don't choose to keep the republic well then of course it's going to fall apart we knew this was an experiment and that was the risk of it\nAnd I think we are seeing some some of those risks top of their heads up but I mean the whole foundation of this country is to let people come out and make their arguments\nAnd we have to make our back that does not mean I'm ... you know the ... thing and I was so encourage I Hope you are too so encouraged by the ... ... a reaction from conservatives\n... shouted down a and I did not see a peep\nOf support from conservatives over the actions of the people protesting ... I didn't see I was disgusted by I was disgusted by it as well and I didn't see any I didn't now I'm not saying there were none I'm sure people will show me a tweet of some you know not job who was like I think they should harass Nancy Pelosi at dinner but\nI didn't see one prominent Republican or conservative support those actions not one you could see if we can we played dozens of Democrat and\nYou know here's here's here's one from Sean King I've said it before but I Need to say it again I'm grateful for ... it's weird that it's politically incorrect for me to say so but I'm Glad we have people in this country who stand up to a fascist and a bigotry and are willing to confront\nEight face to face right and you can tell you there's nothing on the left there are even prominent politicians yeah I I have not seen one prominent conservative support what happened to policy and that's right\nAnd I'm Glad they mean that that shows that there's still you know even though we're divided and even though a lot of things come down to ... minute emotional politics that go minute to minute I'm Glad to see that they're still principles there\nSo here's where I think Ben was wrong when he said to deal with ...\nUm he was right when he said you know it's a small group\n... he's right it is a very small group and they become very very loud because of social media and because of the media but it is a small group where I think he's wrong is ignore it\nIs a part of the solution is ignoring yeah and I think you know 'cause you can't get to the point where like I Would say the same would apply to the ... right right you know the Charlottesville situation um you know\nThere's obviously a crime committed there that um you can't ignore right um but generally speaking when we're a bunch of Nazis or KKK members that you've been having for every person go back for a broken bunch of KKK members walk through your town like ... you know largely speaking it's great to ignore them because they want attention and they run they but that's not what\nWe have now we have NAFTA FAA breaking laws you can't ignore the ... came and they can't ignore that I don't I don't care if it's the Nazis or ... you can't ignore\nAnd I don't think south would argue nor the right I mean like I think he's saying that we get a little bit too wrapped up\nThe back and forth of viral videos and people who are not even really engaged in politics [noise] getting freaked out over things that they're never going to have to necessarily deal with if you just missed a group like as if though that's how they grow\nOr and or at least arguably that's how they grow their own oppose you're seeing it happen in Portland right in the mayor is largely just ignoring what they're doing and it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse that does not mean our lives have to be ruled by enter father and I think that has been generalize argument he was going for\nWell the the\nThe key here is what do you do about it and the solution is to not to do what people did in Florida with an see below sea you don't do that\nBecause that doesn't give you decide to run to\nYeah you don't do what the Proud Boys are doing I'm Sorry but it's just when you talked to a gabbing about that and yeah and I think Gavin is even you know looking at things going okay you know look we were we were doing things because you know it's funny\nA media yeah he's a comedian um but you know this this will\nGrow out of control you just don't do that 'cause there's nowhere to go when you're watching that you're like well I don't like or Nancy Pelosi is doing but I don't like what they're doing\nSo who do I go to and look at look how the press is treating Donald Trump because the press treated capital everybody kind of hard and their positions didn't they everybody just hardened their positions and\nGot more outraged the only the only thing that might have happened is independence looked at that and said\nYou know what I don't want to be with those people left the left and and I don't want to be with ... I don't want to be with the left and then looked over to the Republicans they weren't misbehaving during that\nBut what are we doing to welcome people in if you're kinda saying I don't want to be with those guys and then you see [noise] you know\nBut what are we doing to welcome people in if you're kind of saying I don't want to be with those guys and then you see [noise] you know you ... get out get out there pounded on ... and you're like okay I don't we can't\nWe can't get to a place to where people disengage because if they do completely disengaged then it just run the country is run by radicals\nWe need to be a safe haven we need to be a place of real thought real actual tightened is um and real principals\nAnd we have to present a rational logical alternative I mean that that is one of the reasons I'm a conservative right right I saw the left you know early in my life as a group of people who made decisions emotionally yeah and that's not something I Want to be part of snow\nAnd we can't be a part of that we can't do that ourselves let me go to Andrew in Florida hello Andrew you're on the Glenn Beck program\nGoing good morning first time caller longtime listener

our family most dependent and then think exactly the way I Do a church so disgusted with some of the rhetoric on both sides we just ignore it\nAnd it's always been independent thinkers or we're going to stay that way we also know what's wrong is wrong and what's brightest right as far as extra concern I think a lot of people underestimate that\nWell Andrew I'm you if what you say is true ah than people are a ... ... then the Republicans will keep the house most likely\nA because it is so close at levels we've never seen of interest in participation in the mid term election ever a and it's

know about you but I'm tired of the same old politics\nAnd uh Larry sharp is joining us now he is running for governor in a New York and I think his ideas need to be heard and he needs to be a he needs to be introduced to a larger audience how what is your organization like what's your ground game\nYeah we have we have probably the best um obtain ground you have seen the longtime um if probably ever we have over seven or eight directors campaign manager\nAbout thirty five to fifty people who are actively working every day on every aspect of the campaign to include things like a scheduling setting up a ... a fix our calendar\nOr making sure people show up social media we have a a team on Twitter or team on Instagram a team on Facebook where we have a team when everything's Youtube video production\nAnd whatnot and you don't have but you you're lacking money you're up against people who have tens of millions of tens of millions of dollars absolutely\nWe raised almost half a million but\nThese last couple of weeks if we raise another fifty thousand dollars hundred thousand dollars this becomes winnable I Know it sounds crazy but it is and the reason is name recognition is my only issue\nThe last poll we put out I was at about one third name recognition and with that I pulled the Thirteen percent you can do the math on that one three times to get through a hundred percent equals thirty nine percent right through time Thirteen or ... percent this is a five way race thirty percent when this thing\nSo I'm nine points above victory assuming I get a hundred percent\nThere is the hard part writes a math equation can I get to a hundred percent and sadly that's not my message I've got that down in the media can I get my name out to enough people to where I cross over that barrier which gets to be over\nThirty per se I Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win\nYes ... ... yes really is as well get again remember at as third party in general the system is act against you and some of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine mentality could do this\nBecause every day I'm up against failure but the marine corps taught me take the hill the captain shot take the hill the machine guns broken take the hill radios don't work take the hell was stopped giving excuses take the hell I get it and that's what I Do I take the hill as a matter\nI get I I literally deal with failure every day this woman every day and when I say that that's not an exaggeration\nThat's every single day it's as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS and they're only going to include the Democrat Republican even though I'm On the ballot even though thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition to get me on that ballot\nWCBS they got him ... his name he decided nope lottery shop doesn't live beyond their he's decided that the U.S advertisement as all that matters this is what I'm up again it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that uh you think should be heard than you should probably\nUm maybe tweet storm what's his name again at CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think that we can shell so this is a radio debate\nYet again and they're just deciding now we don't want the dummy wrong there are three other people should be me should also be the Green Party and also the damn party they should all be there but this is the norm and we put up against the war against it constantly and here's the the worst part with all of this was you know roaming and they're still going down\nThat's that's the sad part they don't they don't they don't realize that when a sinking ship mhm or maybe they don't care\nIf people want to donate hopefully doing Larry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you want to get forty five thousand dollars you can't\nThe maximum forty four thousand [laughter] by New York state law so if you I Know what I Want to get like forty five thousand dollars sorry you can't do it forty four you only can get forty four thousand it's all you can get a okay Larry sharp\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired mhm that's what he's done we both over a million\nSince he descendent thrown\nA million ... leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million look they're voting with their feet right in it yes it is so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo because older retirees we have\nAre going to Florida and they have pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent in New York state they being spent in Florida we're lily we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month horrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pension so true pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises general who worked their whole life and were promised ally yep what do you do\nYou see it here in Texas with your belief for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you ate already already happening all the time you're in New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation ... show painted a critical right now are about Fifteen or sixteen percent of our budget and a budget as a hundred and Seventy billion dollars it's double Florida and Florida has more people than us\nYes for about eighty five billion they have more people are not going to be a hundred and Seventy billion dollar budget how about this massive\nAnd it's getting bigger and the buses are getting bigger and so are the percentages of the other pensions but on top of that\nA New York state has about three hundred million dollar debt and about a ...\nSo it's a bad bad bad and then you add that people I was telling me about Lowry the pension fund is good they write the fund itself is relatively well some of the opposite they upended doing very well some of the city wants or disaster but overall soaring well they don't realize it's\nBeing also funded by our tax base a budget that keeps putting money into it the problem is is a fun right now that's great the problem is the actual budget at one point it gets so big that we simply can't pay me more as you're seeing in Dallas and my response to converse about lotteries and the constitution yeah and I get that asked Detroit\nRight asking Puerto Rico right at Venezuela ... it was all legal for them to one there's no money it does get funded when it doesn't get funded that eventually will collapse if that collapses if our pension fund collapsed near state we become Somalia overnight\nI don't want to become a Somali overnight I Want to stop that I'm the only guy talking about negotiating our pensions into the right which is some type of four one K. for her to be something like that and I'm going to go she with every single union that will take forever I Know that's why I say it's a four year plan\nIs for you plan to make us or what New York that it's paying either a flat fee and or a ... percent of that sustainable because the issue we have is a a lot of people are pensions\nWho no longer paying it any more mhm so we just have to keep paying them until they do need pennies anymore so we have to do that also used to be like ten firefighters reporting one now it's one supporting to direct I think she was opening for ... I think that's right I'm not sure but I was making them I think it's something I think it was forty three or four or so\nYeah it's bad so now we have to make that change and the funny thing is people are attacking me saying light wants to get rid of our pensions I'm like I'm the only guy trying to keep them on the other one talking about reality I'm Talking about was actually happening if you had to if you're ready for a pension now it's ten or Fifteen Years from now it's probably not going to be there for you\nBut wide deal with that I mean it's human nature why deal with that if the two on the other side GOP and the Democrats are saying oh he's an extremist tease he's trying to spook you your pensions are fine it's human nature to follow them\nAgreed but I have a problem Glenn I care\nI have a problem I'm human I have a problem I Want people to stay in my state\nI Want people to stay in my state because if they don't say it's going to collapse and I have to move\nAnd I don't want to move I'm born and raised in New York state my family and friends are in New York state I Love my state ... people love New York the heat in the U.S government New York state is very special it has the largest city in the entire nation it has an amazing waterfall Niagara Falls it has mountains as\nCool as Colorado and has farmland in the middle as yes I'm In New York and no ... no farmland as cool as it mid\nWest it has amazing rivers and lakes and every you can imagine in New York the is there is a beautiful diverse state and with destroying it because wedding one city run the entire state\nMost of my my ideas about happiness or the other part is decentralization it's about letting counties ... counties in regions be regions in towns be towns right people upstate tend to get upset with people in the city saying well they're running it and they are bad and cut them off\nIf you ran your own county you wouldn't care and that's what I Want to let people in New York City New York city like isn't by under the rug Rochester\nIsn't that though what we're we're\nDebating now over the electoral college the only reason why we're debating the electoral college is because of the original debate I don't want New York city yeah so tell me in the middle of the country\nHow to live my life yes you will lead to San Francisco bay San Francisco and one of the loop on the streets that's fine yes but we're different here yes\nAnd maybe you want to visit them once in a while right then ... look at the poop refine whatever whatever your thing\nAnd they should be allowed to do to their city their county what they want to do\nA hundred percent true and it's not happening and the issue as we're getting more and more centralized control it happens in any large organization as I told you I'm a business guy right and I'm the guy who I Will come in sometimes and try to help businesses and fix it and make things better and the last thing I say as iron fist\nIt's the last thing I say I hear all the time I go to a business owner and he goes my my leaders aren't doing with them what they should do I take it to innovate ... to take because you're taking charge of things and the last thing I say it's iron fist\nI say give them actually more freedom here's what I Know it's it's literally an equation\nPersonal freedom plus transparency plus accountability equals innovation that happens all the time you give the people more freedom let the leaders take charge someone make mistakes as ... as long as you transparent you learn from them you become humble by them which is fine\nYou give the people more freedom let the leaders take charge someone make mistakes as ... as long as you try and ... you learn from them you become humble by them which is fine we all make mistakes but then what you don't want to simply want to make a mistake blame someone else\nNow you see that these leaders you don't eat which are the ones who will not make any mistakes there doing nothing those over that you don't need you need the ones to get up try do well hit a couple of home runs strike out sometimes get better become humble become better leaders in the long run that how you make a better organization we don't have that\nLeary is going to join me for a a pod cast you'll hear a about Ninety minutes uninterrupted a and we'll put that out on Saturday um Larry sharp is his name and ah you you need to be a need to listen to him I I have a feeling\nThat if he doesn't win New York we're going to be seeing him a again a perhaps the elsewhere but he is um\nHe's worth your time to listen to and if you're in New York\nConsider voting for can't imagine I\nCan't imagine what would stop you because it's not working as it is but that's just me Larry sharp a S.
