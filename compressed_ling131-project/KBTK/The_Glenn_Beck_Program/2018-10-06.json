Democrats\nThe Democrats than are going to demand testimony from Donald Trump because they're going to try to impeach him they're going to demand is tax records because they're going to impeach him and the White House response by going to the Supreme Court and says the president of the time to do this yadda yadda\nUm and the Democrats than watch uh Kavanaugh to recuse himself\nBut she won't do what you all do it doesn't happen a and the the house then moved to impeach Canada\nGay so we've got a year or ... or like originally plausible lots of gay or let's say he's not confirmed because flake or Collins or Murkowski or Heller okay they just don't believe him and the Republicans dropped the ball they have NO PLAN\nAnd they just like well you know and where do you need your vote because we're a repeal Obamacare do they lose the house and possibly the Senate worst case scenario if they don't get they don't get them through down because you have the Republicans ... and because of this week with Jeff Flake\nPeople are just like okay the Republicans are worthless I mean and they don't come out with a huge plant yeah I think you're right they'll try to turn that into a reason to get to the polls but if if if the Republicans that cause it I don't know the kind of where I don't think it'll work\nOkay mother scenario he is confirmed that house impeached is Trump the house or in peaches Kavanaugh on perjury think that is\nIf they were in the house you know they're gonna at least attempt to they will attempt Trump and probably Kavanaugh to correct if we lose the house and the Senate these things are happening and there will there was no chance of them being removed but you will have the next two years of non stop impeachment hearings of both capital and Trump\nOK mhm the only one that seems good to me is I'm a ... if Kavanaugh loses the vote\nThe only one that I think works out is Kavanaugh loses the vote which could be really bad because it'll be the Republicans

know oh my gosh that's a skill Leah\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's favorites I mean they're okay with them but no I always willing to die in a sword for memory might remember Kavanaugh was not on the initial list of judge right from Trump and there's lots of them he asked them later I personally think the best course of action\nIs to nominate let's say let's say flake intolerance come out and go you know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great\nDonald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion

that's\nAnd ... are those are things that she showed two co workers in\nReal time in real time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at\nThat time yeah but but but lives in I mean you I mean you don't have videotape\nWell it was you got the tape now we haven't seen it yet though uh-huh now there is allegedly videotape that exist somewhat of one of these physical altercation ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video\nOf the Kavanaugh thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the with ... with the\n... and we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence in the forties so we have I mean like we have him out more I was like we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alison case yeah however\nUm what's interesting about this\nIs that fifty six percent of Democrats believe Christine Blasey Ford's allegations fifty six percent only eight percent say they ... they believe Kavanaugh fifty six to eight\nIs a split there do you assume\nThat if you ask people and it wasn't a partisan situation what do you think about the Alison situation do you what do you believe from her 'cause she's got a more recent allegation she's actually brought it to the attention in real time to multiple people people around her have seen evidence of this there's text messages there is a there are medical notes all the evidence that we just talked about there's\nAn infinity amount times more evidence and the elephant case\nGet only five percent of Democrats believe Allison's accuser we're told over and over again that women are to be believed it only five percent of Democrats believe\nAllegations against Keith Ellison\nAnd here's why this is really important I'm just like I don't want an abuser and the Supreme Court if if there was the amount of evidence on Kavanaugh that there is on a Keith Ellison I Would not be for Kavanaugh would you\nIf there was a ... on ... no I wouldn't yeah I Would if if if the evidence was the same thing yeah what\nWe still have a standard here in this country um called innocent until proven guilty and preponderance of evidence is a slower it's a lower level than that and I understand that\nUm my issue here would be\nYou can want there isn't the legal standard because people will say well this is just a job interview or this is just that this isn't a legal proceeding once you have the absence of a legal standard you have to choose the standard you apply\nI Choose to apply a very high standard because people who are in relationships many many times when he relationships and breakup or someone feels Jill to say things\nThat are not true I having all that I agree with oh wait wait you know in this case\nI'm Keith Ellison should have the right to defend himself and he should we\nShould assume his innocence unless I agree point in which a ... he is and if especially with a case like this where it's very recent\nThat should just go through the legal system and when he comes out and he's guilty then he should get thrown out of that job and you can factor that in in your vote if you wish but I don't think he should lose any job because of this at this point he needs to you need to be able to see\nWhether this case goes through and and claims are proven someone had said they have video we need to see the video we see everyone a in investigated we need to see an actual police\nAre investigation go through and and and the weather the evidence leads us to a belief that he actually committed these acts if we do not get that\nYou do not ruin people's lives over it I mean think about the amount of times of evidence that there is a whiskey dealt in overall you more which everyone I mean even if a lot of people on the right where like look ... really looked like he did these things his answers are really bad\n... you know there's much more evidence for the ... much more there's people you can interview right now yeah children who went through traumatic moments where they had to read about their mom being abused or you know her telling other friends at the time\nThat being said however you get when you went through this process where the presumption of innocence I agree\nSo but what I Know about Keith Ellison is the evidence against him okay\nAssuming this was not current day and it was thirty five years ago if for ... would come with that evidence\nI have letters I have a photo of lead bruises on my arm I have um ah I can tell you where it happened I told my friends and here they are they verify that I told them after the party ... would you not\nWould you not go okay I think that's good yeah I mean I think that would be enough and it was the only way we can judge the situation wrecked right correct here it is with Alison and again this is why it's important\nJust like I don't want to have a Supreme Court justice that is an abuser or a liar or whatever I also think it's extraordinarily dangerous\nTo have a guy who\nMay have beaten his girlfriend may have mentally abused his girlfriend assuming the evidence is real and checks out you can't have him as the as the the the chief law enforcement of the state\nRight and does anybody care no this shows you that nobody\nIn the media\nAnd for some of the state right and does anybody care no this shows you that nobody\nIn the media cares at an iota\nFor this woman and her story they don't care if she was abused and they don't care about any of it would they care about is stopping Brett Kavanaugh\nIf they care thing would be just as passionate as a guy let's not just thrown out of the Minnesota attorney general this is a guy who was second in charge of the deep what the the DNC ... this is not a a a a ... a peripheral figure in politics he's one of the most powerful Democrats in America and is now going to be a chief law enforcement officer for state\nAnd you can say oh well it's all you're what you're doing is what about them no no it's not it's not what about them I apply that same standard Alison that I applied to Kavanaugh\nYou weren't doing this to Canada I Would still be saying this about I'm I'm a about I was\nLooking to go back to why it's rocket why was Brock Obama president\nRight rock bottom with

a Senate seat that would have been incredibly close if he was going against Alan Keyes who they flew in the last week to just started a campaign\nBut it was a Jack Jack Ryan but it might be thinking of junk residency at this point I'm trying to think too many Amazon commercials but uh Ryan was his last name and he was a legitimate challenger\nTo Brock Obama in that Senate race it was a close election and he may have won it\nAs a Republican in Illinois wow and what they did it they went through his divorce his field divorced or um hearings and ... and paperwork\nOut it it to the public and in there there were accusations by his wife the actress who said they went to swingers clubs and all this sort of shady stuff\nDo we know if that was true in added horse proceeding and the divorce proceeding people make all sorts of yelling and that's why you don't just believe them that's why they're healed because they went\nAnd got them on the old in a democratic state and they they they ... Brian eventually dropped out there was no real opposition for Rocco bomb and you've got eight years of him\nThat sort of thing should be always viewed skeptically\nEvery claim of a crime should be viewed skeptically by people on that side you're supposed to give the presumption of innocence and close to start with skepticism of a claim on any ... on any side on any side of all people who are accused and here we are in a situation where Democrats overwhelmingly believe the accusations against capital with almost no evidence\nAnd they only five percent of them believe the woman who is a Democrat who does not want someone up a ideologically opposed to ... to Keith Ellison to have that job she's a Democrat\nAnd only five percent of people believe her the the platitudes you hear from the media and the left I mean nothing on the story they do not care about whether for with abused or not they don't [noise]\nAnd this shows you how fast that standard is applied and how [noise]\nAnd how your life could be destroyed\nYou are on the wrong side of an issue and by the way I think you've seen the issues to change\nAnd up positions what's politically correct changes and if you don't abide one hundred percent and you're not on the right side will destroy your life [noise]\nWhile they let somebody else be fine\nThis is why we must have a standard we must have a standard\nGetting dangerous to be an American [noise] that's a frightening thing to say [noise]\nClan that\nWe Bruce Sam adams Boston longer was only these hand selected heirloom hops not pretty just delicious Boston you can leave us domestic looks like a responsibly [noise]\nWe see it every day they cut you off\nIt's called road rage\nThey're Mandy overpaid on a used car\nThey didn't go to ... dot com [noise] our facts has a better way\nWhen you search used cars and car facts dot com you get the most accurate price based on the car facts reporting so you never have to overpay on a used car again start your used car search today at ... dot com\nNinety seven point one the big t._v. gee cake and Gina village northern Arizona is more stimulating talk\n[noise]\nWaiting the future of Brett Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court I'm ham who's now Fox News\nI Do believe that way well confirmed judge Kavanaugh today our next U.S Supreme court justice Senate Republicans\nI'm Pam who's now Fox News\nI Do believe that way well confirmed judge Kavanaugh today our next U.S Supreme court jobs that Senate\nRepublican Joni Ernst and the chamber prepares for a final vote on Kavanaugh's nomination the Iowa senator telling Fox is near ... food out it's clear to her that the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh were baseless\nWe certainly want survivor they heard that is very important to me that understanding that again we live in a nation that Dolly is the fact that we are innocent until proven guilty\nOn the other side of the arguments Senate Democratic here ... brand\nAngle day for the brave courageous survivor who have had to relive trauma\nAnd in some cases have found the courage\nTo tell their story for the very first time\nToday's vote just hours away\nThis vote is probably going to come a little earlier than we thought the center has been in around the clock since yesterday they been incest and all night so that votes would start about three thirty four o'clock they'll close the vote about Fifteen minutes after that we think we know what the vote total was going to be it should be fifty eight\nForty eight days one president Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and then one apps and Steve Gaines Republican Montana\nFox has had ... minutes ago the president called today a big day Chicago police officer is spending his first full day behind bars\nVeteran Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was led away by sheriff's deputy says bomb revoked after being found guilty of murder too and sixteen counts of aggravated battery have a twenty four teen shooting of teen burglary suspect ...

Larry's wise or he is the president of government accountability Institute the producer of a\nDocumentary called the creepy line the creepy line dot com um we're talking about Google\nAnd Larry I've never I've never believed in\nYou know those dystopian movies I've always made fun of them and said yeah there's just this is crazy you know the corporations out to get you\nBecause of their algorithms because they are so all encompassing that is the world were headed towards what do they tell you when they say algorithms that we have to keep that top secret because\nYeah they what they argue is it's it's for reasons of of a state secret um\nAnd and you know that they need to protect their trade secrets they need to be a a you know making sure that nobody gets access to it there's some truth to that but there are a lot of things that they could do to demonstrate um that they're offering a fair product in service to people and here's the thing that they have lied about this before\nYou know ten years ago or so you had other companies like trip advisor and Yelp\nWho are saying that Google was artificially suppressing their rankings in Google in favor of Google owned companies which okay you know Google has the right to do that but here's the thing\nGoogle flat outlined said absolutely not we don't do that our algorithm is pure it's true the best results or ... or or organically at the top well here's the problem the Federal Trade commission the European Union\nProfessors at Harvard University looked at this and said yes you are fiddling with the algorithm you are screwing these other competitors and you're lying to the point is when Google says you can trust the algorithm you can trust us they've lied before and they're lying now and I think the only question that remains really is how are we going to deal with is\nUm you know there's old story that Henry Kissinger said when he was on the national Security Council\nYou give president three choices do nothing\nTake my solution or thermonuclear war those are your three choices are in this case it's kind of like that we can do nothing\nWe can try to deal with some sort of the regulatory issues related with Google or we can break up these companies those are the three options that we have and I think we're really at the point of point number three\nBecause this is not a monopoly like standard oil standard oil that's going to dominate the market Mrs controlling the news flow in the United\nStates is in the end this is in the and Peter ... controlling everything yes Google is ... the most likely company in the America in the American world or to come up with a guy yes who ever\nWho ever gets to a I first controls everything there's no way to beat it probably once you have a guy yes this company is the most likely in the free world to come up with it\nIf we don't have them\n... contained in some way or another when they get to a I worked hosts yeah\nYes that's exactly right and here's the thing it's not just\nGoogle the company a lot of people don't realize this I didn't realize is if you use safari on your apple product you're actually using the Google algorithm and that is Google information on if you're using if you are using um Yahoo\nYou're using Google the point being Firefox is Google the all these entities are using the Google algorithm so even if you say I Am not going to use Google dot com you're using unless you are making very specific choices for other options if you using any of those others\nGoogle is the one that's dominated by the way Google pays apple\nNine billion dollars a year Google actually pays apple\nThat's exactly right you you are the product yeah we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing\nAll of it look you know there's that this is just at the beginning let me tell ya boogie story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay this center is the main city of aging how many people it used to look it up for me what he's doing how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy ... pick somebody to go into the center of the city just go hide K [laughter] they had a picture of the guy\nAnd the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then\nAfter like an hour or two they gave the leaves system\nThe picture of the guy and said find him\nIn eight minutes he was in the back of a squad car unbelievable in a ... minute yes city of twenty two million yeah twenty two million amazing in eight minutes yeah so and this this with out AI right this is the kind of stuff that it's coming that people really need to pay attention to\nThat's right and and Google is at the forefront of that they they take a position of pride that they are the forefront of exploiting future technologies real quick though on Gmail this is very important for people to realize that just shows you how far Google goes\nI used to have a Gmail account now what ... does is they scan every email that comes into your Gmail account and every email you send out you know what else they scan\nIf you've ever written a draft email let's say you're mad at your cousin you know I'm sick of you know cousin Chris and all the crazy stuff he does and you write in late one night you write a draft and you say you know what\nI don't think I'm going to send that to Chris that's just me\nBeing on just a second I Want to make sure this is writing a draft but that's not saving it as a draft correct It's just you ... it ... the delete delete delete delete delete delete it's not even saving it as a draft\nRight correct that's correct it scanned by Google\nSo Google knows more about you than you know you can have a very open and completely transparent relationship with anybody in your life your spouse\nYour best friend whatever Google knows more about you than they do\nAnd they are very aggressively going to retain that information but they're using it against you here's the key thing it's not just privacy it's manipulation\nBecause they want to take that information and not just sell information advertisers they as part of their mission want to steer and move your life in a certain direction that they deem is the way the direction your life should go\nTo Peter Schweitzer the documentary as the creepy line or ... let me push back in a couple of ensure or at least problems I have 'cause I'm with you on Ninety percent of the one issue I have is Google is awesome it all of the products that they make\nAre better than everybody else's product that have similar ... and it it would eat ... incredibly inconvenience me\nTo give up Google because all of their products work better than everybody else's ... doesn't know [laughter] more easier because I mean yet they're everywhere but they all they're doing really good job yeah ... uh when it comes to designing an easy to use product right how do you ... that that's a great\nQuestion and it's not easy I mean there are alternatives search a systems out there um but none of them are as good as Google\nAnd it's not really that I don't know I think that's a a a road that people will go down that you shouldn't go down that what we should go down is we should be talking to the people in ... no no no\nWe should be sending people who understand this five to Washington because by the time we talked to Washington it's already over we need people who understand the ethics of what's going on with high tech in Washington\nBecause they need to have this conversation right now it's not about us changing our behavior fry it to the point we must corral Google and\nBreak them up or corral them in some way not just little litigation because I'm a ... litigation but are not with just little simple laws of are we going to cut because they'll go around that\nThat fire right okay\nLet me have one other one yeah you said this earlier and it made me very uncomfortable and my suspicion is it makes you very uncomfortable to which is your solution we\nSee we're leaning towards breaking up these companies and\nAs a capitalist as a person who does not want the government involved right or in private business\nI mean how do you how do you have a bridge that guy no I mean I I think that's a great point and I came reluctantly tennis as I looked at all the possible things to do with Google here's the problem into this space the way that technology is moving how Google exerted market dominance it really we really do not have a free market\nIn search uh it's really impossible in fact one of the guys we we interview the vice president of Yelp or in in our in our a film a and the founder of Yelp said he wouldn't start up today because it'd be impossible Google would smother them the only reason that Yelping these other entities have survived as they have built up enough brand equity\nWhen they were founded what Fifteen Twenty years ago to where they can exist so we have a situation where\nThey're truly is not a functioning\nA monopoly and by the way Google's market dominance is partly related to its political alliance in Washington may pass laws and rules all the time to squelch competition a veteran or benefit\nAnd to do things like the platform ing yes we are not a publisher we're a platform right then they go in and they add it will now your publisher you're not a platform so they play it both ways and they're they have the money to do it\nAnd that's a hugely important point because when they first want it or it was set up the regulation for the Internet it was if your publisher you're treated as a media company if you're a neutral platform which is what Google and Facebook claim they are\nInternet it was if your publisher you're treated as a media company if you're a neutral platform which is what Google and Facebook claim they are they said we're not going to any content they even use the analogy were like a telegraph we're just taking a telegraph message from Peter and we're sending it to Glenn\nNothing else is happening when we all know that's not true now they're editing or they're censoring so they are acting as publishers but unlike other publishers they don't face the legal or regulatory burdens that they do so twice a year in competition\nOr even the public scrutiny even the public you sound like you're crazy if you talk against Google editing for I Know that they are like the when one solution be to make their algorithms trends parent\nA yes that would help but the algorithm is changing constantly and and I do get I Am sympathetic to the argument that this is a trade secret that they work very very hard to develop and they have\nUm I think by breaking them up into pieces and by the way I don't think it's just two companies I think it's several different Columbia felt so bad [laughter] um I think it would be would be extremely helpful in the way to go on this because otherwise they're going to continue to re ...\nThe other thing I hear conservative talk about and I find this terrifying is to make them a utility\nOh no no no terrified I don't know what the utilities are like here in Dallas oh no [laughter] we don't really have a we have an open energy yeah oh that's all we have five different energy company as in yeah we don't pay anything yeah like the\nNotion of making Google a public utility ... which really means you're making your government utility now means you've got a government controlling search no I live in a no interest in that whatsoever\nAnd what you are seeing is is merging of Google which used to be generally out of politics very little lobbying very little interaction\nWhen Barack Obama was elected in two thousand age\nYou saw this enormous influx of Google people into Washington DC and they stayed so what is now one of the most plugged in if not the most plugged in corporation in America so this notion that there are kind of these wild cat or out in Silicon valley that are like independent from government is just totally ridiculous I could\nSpend two days with you um I really enjoyed this I'm going to take a hard\nPass on that show where you know by all our\nPeters wiser he is a president or the government accountability Institute the documentary is called the creepy line how do you see it\nUh it's going to be available shortly on Amazon I tunes there's a trailer on the Web page and we love to get feedback\nFrom then it won't be it will be on a YouTube I [laughter] I think is so much
