Jesus and and and again I Know that's overtly spiritual but we're talking here in this this focus I mean so it's to take any for Jesus Jesus is not coming back on air force one he's not riding a donkey or an elephant when he does\nAnd to acknowledge that I'm only all in as a Christian\nAnd following Christ and everything else is shaped around that my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom that's kind of our motto we're weak college my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom than anything else\nSo I explain this yesterday that um you know the the so called Christians of the Westboro Baptist church you know they they hold up signs you know God hates this Scott hates that blah blah blah they're just despicable you don't win\nBy by holding up signs no God hates view and shouting things back you win by listening by understanding by him racing them as a soul or a brother and sister not to do what they're doing\nStanding up but people have been changes one woman in particular that actually left her own family in the Westboro Baptist church because\nSomebody spoke to her with ... with the ability and said let's just reason here for a minute\nYeah that's okay I I on my desk actually right every front of me a name played because they actually protested at my church we went out and serve them coffee and doughnuts and they called me and the national news\nI Can't use one of the words probably on the radio but a lying the false prophet and so it's actually one of my staff made into a name played it says it says lined Blanco false prophet Westboro Baptist church which by the way of Cedar Rapids either Baptist church\nBut but in doing so I mean the question is how do we respond well somebody reached out actually interviewed or the members of the family as well a Christian Today so somebody reached out\nAnd I will tell you I think that's what we can do right now with the blue deeply disagree with us in the book is filled with examples of Christians who actually built relationships with people who radically disagreed\nAnd in the process rebel to come to maybe a better understanding of what examples for example is a\nIs the president by older university which is a Christian university in California are met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party and say legislature there in California that was trying to change laws that would make it illegal for by old enough to live their Christian beliefs about merit\nWell he ended up getting to understand each other better but will the bill was ultimately not move forward but dropped and and and now we're at a very different place now\nI'm not saying you can always do that but I Am saying that Christians need to try to do that\nAnd I do think that in doing so well liked a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians historically because at the moment we're in is not time for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and and as you said earlier to your caller I'm calling people to arms yet\nThat's not I mean clearly that's not an uncommon of you know some of the some of the worst things I see on social media I I click on a lake and I find go to the bio and its first think listen the thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like and I think that's what we need is a change in a lotta arts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us is right now or the the victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained as slaves or you know story after story after story of these Christian\nWho I mean I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you I'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we are going to come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit\nAnd we're gonna crucify you the family set down kids at all and wrote a letter and said\nWe understand we forgive you for that we're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with pita yeah unbelievable what's happening\nWhere we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fencing ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate 'cause you know victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about or try to hold back the advance of course it either pagan\nOr they just gobbled up whole foods right now and when they did kroger's stock went from thirty one dollars a share to twenty two [laughter] that's how big this company is wow they're going to be a the largest clothing retailer by twenty twenty\nOr they already sell more books than anybody on earth they've driven how many\nUh book retailers out of business\nUm and they're they're about to spend more on original programming than even Netflix or they're going to be the biggest Hollywood producer [laughter] and just so many things is it time to\nI mean I don't know what you do about it do you favor as a capital is breaking up a company that's what they did the Microsoft that's what they did to or are they tried to to Microsoft that's what they did with mountain bell I'm\nYvette mountain dealt with in with the government\nI mean that was that was protected by the government and part of a you know that was\nThat was a protected property you couldn't you couldn't start anything against them\nRight that's why yeah I mean you know you could start your own Amazon you're not going to be able to compete on I think there are other options you know there were other outages are just people you know the problem is Amazon does everything better than everybody else you know this is a real problem where we've been talking about this week is I don't I don't want you to change\nAmazon I like Amazon I like Amazon Prime I like the fact that yesterday we were trying to build a stupid volcano for um my daughter\nAnd Tanya went and got a three percent hydrogen peroxide and we're reading it I'm like I think Seventy five percent is a different kind of peroxide and it is I didn't I mean it's a dangerous kind of peroxide [noise]\nUm and we didn't have it so I go online and I'm like where can you get it Amazon [laughter] I mean it'll have you'll have tomorrow you know yeah that was ... I mean it's yeah I don't want them to change some of these things yeah and\nAnd we're the same way with Google and Google's getting pretty intrusive things right but we we like their search engine yeah we'd like their browser their mail is greater mail is great I mean like free and so we\nJust we get it out or you've given it all live from Google\nAmazon you make the same argument Amazon controls I mean people are like oh well I buy a lot of things for Amazon and that's obviously a big part of their business when they're cloud computing is really the main thing driving all of their profit auto um you know and it's a and so many places or use it every place you go on the Web based government young Amazon yeah I mean\nAnd it's like you know Alexa at this point is a\nIt's a luxury a product of moderate\n... utility right like I mean I feel like it's fun to play with like we use it as a speaker\nAsk if the weather every once in awhile I mean there's a couple of things you can do it but I mean like I I don't know as the likes of changing my life now as soon as I Know what I Do absolutely has changed my yes yeah I mean it ... I I ... yeah prime now can deliver to your door within an hour yeah I mean\nYou could I think you can safely say Amazon has almost\nKilled the them all\nYeah I get most of the ... right I mean it's you know between Amazon and Google they have totally changed the world well yeah yeah like there's a there's a big mall near where we're doing the show in Texas and you know it's it's still has tons and tons of stores in it but you start to notice the way it ...\nDid you come from a place to shop into a place\nFor experiences yes there are lots of things for kids and lego stores and aquariums they took one of the big box stores\nAnd they made it into a giant um it's I think it's called the field house it's a giant gym with like twenty five basketball courts in all leagues always more as entertainment yeah let's see more of an entertainment complex has has to go yeah well\nIt's not necessarily a bad thing I mean I don't get it's a cool you go somewhere and have an experience with other people and then people bring things to your door it's spent tons\nOf something that I can I can I tell you about the experience I had last last week and I have to tell you it is\nOkay\nThe only thing ... you get to be rich it's the same problems just bigger OK mhm\nUh is there is one game changer and that is private air travel that changes your life entirely okay\nOn that same media ...
