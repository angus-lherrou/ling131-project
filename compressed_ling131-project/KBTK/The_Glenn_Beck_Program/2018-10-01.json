every single person in this audience I Want you to ask your friends that\nLet's imagine for a second that every single person that you want elected from from dog catcher to president of the United states\nThat every person you want elected is elected and they are putting in all of the policies that you want\nIt's it's your utopia\nVery remains about fifty percent of the country and I'm going to be really just\nThere's thirty or forty percent of the country that disagrees with your utopia they just want to go in a different direction what do you do with the forty percent of the population that does not\nAgree with you\nWhat do you do with them\nWhat do you do to make sure that those people don't start infecting the minds of others\nSo your perfect utopia starts to fall apart what\nHappens with the ones who won't comply with these new rules what do you do to make sure that that utopia it remains in place by keeping all of those people in power because there's going to be another election and if if history tells us anything it swings the other direction what\nOnce you have the power what are you willing to do to keep the power\nIf your answer to all of those questions isn't nothing\nYou have gone over the cliff because in America the answer to what are you going to do to all of those people who disagree the answer in America is nothing what are you willing to do to keep your power or the answer in America is nothing\nWhat do you do to to silence those who will not comply the answer in America\nIs nothing so any time somebody says we should shout these people down they've taken the first step\nAll thought is creative when you begin to speak things they you speak them into existence when you say\nWe shouldn't round people up the more people that say we should round people up we should disturb them in their own homes we should we should picket and surround their houses the more that you say that the more reality is created in that direction\nBe very careful on what you say and what you think\nThe answer to these questions in America must remain\nNothing\nI Will not do anything to my neighbor who disagrees to me\nWith me I Will not do anything and everything to hold on to power\nI Will state my case and I will Duke it out on the battlefield of ideas I Will not silence other people I Will not smear or destroy other people I Will not be calm everything I despise\nThat go army stuff in my arms and the book covers and still in high school at the time\nAnd he said and as I'm walking out the wrinkle recorded there that's arms folded and he

first illegal drugs and eventually illegal drugs and and she was a victim of the drug war and she was a convicted felon\nSo I pulled her out of prison and I used my whatever things that had to try to get her back up and running a reading her an apartment in the house that coming up on a car that kind of thing and\nShe struggled and if you if you've had a felon in your life and you know hard it can be right they have that on the record and then they feel less then and then when they get a job there a hostage to that job because they're afraid that do the job for them and\nIt's just bad bad bad so I said you know what\nI'm gonna do something I've been taken actually my whole life and take action now too and we decided to start our own business I figured if we're in charge him with the boss is you can't fire that's it so we started on but we can't trucker so became we had a small trucking company\nWho what did you know about but what did you know about business nothing [laughter] matter God Bless America would it matter what it was what what right have a\nChoice I allow my mother to be a hostage\nI Do something I was my option go to business school what that what I was going to do\nA Latino right eye ... eye drops I don't I never I never happened never will ever measure\nAny plan I have against perfection because perfection doesn't\nStatus quo because that has caused what I have status quo was my mother as hostage I don't accept that as well so was that isn't is it did well my my um it did well I actually left it let ... let her and my step dad run it and she ran into she retired and when she retired she they were too many New Yorkers do and that is leaving New York state and she went to South Carolina to retire\nUm so she did that and ... and she was fine until she passed away several years ago but after that that's what I Would often did you I don't think I had many different jobs and then decided you know what the first visit ... let me try another one so I thought at my second business\nAnd that's when I actually uh that when I did not do well and that's why I said we're not that's when I first heard you back when you want your Philly station\nI'm In the morning show\nGet outta here yes that's when I first heard you doing your ah your jokes um about an hour and a stand [laughter] I remember I remember I was I was I was driving around and and I was actually listen to you I think you can I Am I yeah yeah I think so yeah I Am yes you and your your morning show I remember listening to back then and\nUm then I did that and I sold that business off it and not do as well as I Want to be that do but I was called that my MBA that failure was my MBA\nYeah I'm from that I have one more job and then started this job now that this is now that I have which I'm a trainer consultant teacher\nSo as large clients like a ... and I say laughter and smaller clients like small law firms I teach um leadership and executive coach at each business I've been an executive in a public company twice as a a band aid\nAnd I've taught him many colleges that Bruce St John J. and I've taught as a guest instructor at the graduate level about Yale and Colombia and\nNow the about what have you done with your life seriously and what have you I I'm a loser I'm Sorry I'm yeah holy as so oh you are a guy that\nTo me seems tailor made for the times that we live in I I mean I think Iraq Obama\nWas also in in some ways tailor made for the times that we live in and I don't think he lived up to his potential\nUm the more division happened um we we need somebody that can speak to all sides with a with credibility somebody who can speak to prison reform\nWith credibility and not an axe to grind but common sense and experience\nYes I mean this is the thing that I talk about all the time you know I've dealt with and seeing the prison system from both\nYou know both sides my father's rushes off from my mother as as a felon and I say the same thing as I say in business and that is when you want to fix something you don't walk in and start dictating when you do that you get rebellion when you do that people say no\nThe issue that we have particularly in New York state but throughout the country is we have to side to side of thinking right as you said before a binary I either every corrections officers a thug and every single person there is a victim or every prisoner is evil and she'd be killed in every corrections officers perfect\nAnd neither is true the reality of it is to fix this is the situation in prison we have to have the corrections officers as part of the solution and that's hard for people to understand because I think that part a system yes but they see people\nEvery day what I Know for sure in prison right now we have people in jail who should probably never get out ever what bad people should never got out and\nThere are people who made a mistake should pay that society and should then get a second chance and people probably shouldn't be in jail at all the issue is I don't know which one is which and I never will but you know who does\nCorrections officers who deal with them every day\nThose are the people who deal with the inmates everyday\nHow do I know that to be true you look at Massachusetts right now they have the Humvee program which is a program that has CEOs corrections officers and volunteers from outside together with a specific community in this case the communities veterans but you can pick any community a community that that feels no and they see in prison everyday\nYou make that happen to all of us what happens\nYou know if people who've had that problem\nAs volunteers knows your tax money\nYou also have corrections officers who know how to control people know which people who can get in there no those who will be scanning and went out the those who are scanning and we'll put the people who need to have the rights the right to the second chat out there in his program how do we know that there is it isn't right in Massachusetts in general is about Seventy five percent\nWhen this program less than five percent\nHoly do yes no no specialized people coming in corrections officer into it here's the problem in New York say specifically for corrections officers ... the the the life expectancy is fifty eight years\n... years old not just that every corrections officer I've met either know someone who committed suicide\nAnd or a knows someone who is so ready to leave they had become completely apathetic to assist them\nThis is a problem all of them to have the same thing Larry you know I'm I'm already there their therapist I'm already there that marriage Calif I'm already they're legal assistant already helped them out with all kinds of things I'm already trying to help them\nThere are so many CEOs who would happily ship into this world without having to change any where at anybody giving them an actual contract they haven't had a contract and three years in the upstate that's how bad it is so we could actually fix things this is a parable if we actually use both sides and\nGo in and asked the people who are there how to fix it that's how you if it's in the business that's how you fix it in life\nAnd where do you have time can I hold you for a while to ...\nOkay ah I Want to take a break 'cause I I Want to talk to you about the economy I Want to talk to my business sure are and you know the direction of California where they've they've just a mandated that you know women now have to be on the board of directors\nOr ... we're going to completely
