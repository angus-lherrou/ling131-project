weekend\nIs the one year anniversary October fifth one year ago\n\nThe me too movement was organized New York times ran their bombshell story on Harvey Weinstein and it has been twelve straight months of me to madness now this is incredible if I Would have said me too I Would have thought this has been two years it's been twelve months\nIt's been good and it's been bad it's\nTurned into an absolute nightmare I think we\nCan all stand in solidarity\nAll of us stand with people who have accused who have accused people and have proven the case that this person is guilty we all stand by it the witch hunt not so much we\nCan stand against violence against women violence against men end violence against children there's without a doubt every American is for that\nBut over all the me too movement in twelve months has become an out of control monster in the span of three hundred and sixty five days four hundred and twenty nine people had been accused in a total of more than Seventeen hundred\nAllegations keep in mind these are the high profile cases spanning Hollywood governments in big business you at in the lesser known cases that we know of Andy accused doubles\nNumbers are pretty easy to find but guess which numbers aren't the amount of convictions good luck finding those maybe we should take Kavanaugh and just throw him in the water and see the floats\nCourse it'd be floats he's a rapist if he doesn't he's innocent\nWhat's the number of convictions it seems kind of relevant you would think the me too movement in the rest of the media would be eager to post those numbers but they don't\nMeet too has devolved from the post wind steam fall out as a movement that cows accusations as facts\nThey rushed to collect heads this is the French Revolution evidence doesn't matter cooperation doesn't matter it is the accusation that is all important\nThat is what this movement has become you can call it a witch hunt or you can call it the McCarthy hearings but believe me there is no difference when we get ten years Twenty years down the road that is exactly what this movement will look like\nMy hand it's comedy I energy\nGrowing up on me and my\nLike Africa

Want to ask you honestly Dane is if for Montana leaving to go to his daughter's wedding and I was ... there's the really important vote and who knows what happened to twelve hours even if something goes wrong but I thought that my daughter and I was like you know what I I Would totally leave\nOh I'm In my daughter's finally gave you my daughter's wedding nothing right choice yes\nYeah I mean I'm I'm I don't know why they can't work out something on that\nUm you know there are ways to vote 'em but I you look you know if your daughter's getting married your daughter's got married um maybe they could move the ceremony later and they could but I don't know I don't know but you're right you gotta you gotta family first\nAnd there's no reason why these guys have to be there why are we using Seventeen hundreds technology out of the year ...\nEl reason if he can be on a phone\nHigh right right and they could make an exception I think but you're right okay what else\nI'm All right well she's only send me an hour on that I thought where are they going to say if you want me to give you so now we've got to get on it or they will give us two minutes not an ongoing they asked that\nA lot of the book is about evil and and my contention is that most Americans don't understand evil my mother did she lived a very\nI I'm an array of your life yeah she's on ... which is obviously\nBut she wrote me and thought I was good\nSo they just didn't understand evil right right\nSo we're seeing so much evil in America are we not um you know people walking in the schools and gunning down kids or clerics are abusing children um Chicago where thousands of people are shot by drug gangs and nothing's done opioid epidemic through the roof\nThis is all evil it centered on evil and so\nI don't know yet I mean I Can't speculate on that I can just I Know I'm pretty good at at a value waiting the mood of the country\nYou may remember that five days before the election of two thousand sixteen I predicted Trump would whether I predict it because people didn't like Hillary Clinton would stay home\nI mean that was my best that I ever did in ... right now I Am feeling it everywhere I go I Know a lot of people around okay\nThat the regular folks know this was a sham\nAnd they know that cabin on his family were damaged very ...\nDidn't care to seek the truth they know that\nThat I think will play out in our politics but you got to remember is a powerful powerful corrupt lobby\nThat is driving me to thing and the media\nIs like what ... what was like this is still a brand new but then the second\nTime I go to Graham Grassley\nHis hair was that I I Believe\nOkay also to miss half and\nUm you have to understand that the media in conjunction with the fanatics Israel it's powerful powerful to drive\nSay so I only have to hold on to stop hold on\nJust er Heller she's now ... now yes being in the big one that's your health and\nMrs heights man yeah Murkowski commander in Hong\n... Johnson is there a gym Mr Cain\nKennedy Mr King is a big one is clear return\n\nIs your Kyle\nMr Lankford surely he\nCertainly\nMr Manchin\nMr Markey when you when did I mention\nMcCaskill Murkowski Mr McConnell\nInstrument into almost there Merkley about on this summer and it came I write is Murkowski\nIslands so we do not Murphy will know soon wouldn't you know we didn't\nKnow on a mansion or Murkowski those are the two very interesting\nOne is is strange I'm watching all of the networks and none of them are catching the vote so no one is\nYeah north of New York times or we're looking at all the science right now to see what the nobody knows we don't know yeah yeah yeah yeah and that's kind of has\nA you know they're gonna they're closed debate and I'm Benno both moral and I do believe a cabinet will be confirmed [noise] um nobody wants to be on the wrong side of this and the winds are blowing against\nThe Democrats now the winds have shifted\nA listener emailed me out of the wind shifting don't you think I mean this the first time I've ever seen this tactic by the Democrats backfire on them\nI don't know the Clarence Thomas stuff was pretty rough um and I think that a African Americans at the time were pretty angry about it\nBut it that of course the dissipated once he got on a court the question is if Kavanaugh is confirmed more or less all go away we'll people just say okay the good guys one and and we're not\nReal are interested in punishing the Democrats I don't think so anymore I don't think I I just think people are so furious I think they're gonna they're gonna take it out on\nThe ... I think the Democrats think that they can for all these these um activists they really think that they can you know tap 'em you know turn 'em on and turn them off no I Know they do but I think they're approaching a time when they're not going to be able to turn them off\nA ... I don't see it that way in which is very well organized you're going to get individuals that confront people in restaurants or ... that you're going to have that and somebody might get hurt\nBut on the organized front these people are very disciplined and there's about a dozen organizations now where money is flooding into disrupt the process on the part of the far left\nThan by um there's some news Iraq\nYet with um one thing a couple of things here are Collins one of the big ones are yes ... I'm like so yeah and in the ass so\nI'm I'm sure Murkowski was a yes and mansion I don't know that that's an interesting or in the middle of looking\nAt that right now ah and bill do you think that they just overplayed their hand oh yeah I really feel like they could have had it they could have had Murkowski they could have had colon if they really played this seriously but instead they overplay their hand to an incredibly worldly\nAbsolutely and they didn't have what they didn't have um ... I went through this and and and all the all of a sudden I Everytime I turned around there was somebody else and the law Riley did this\nWas a true mhm All right so what they thought would that more people were going to come out\nAnd and point a finger at him and and or somebody was going to bolster Ford's\nParty statement on all yeah I was at that party and I saw this happen where do they have to lose they threw it out there the less accepted\nIt as fact and made it easier for people to come through and then you add an avid ... and all these other crazy people\nPiling on and and the and the left said look this is what usually happens but here um you know with the FBI involvement and you know pretty strong statement by Kavanaugh\nKavanaugh saved himself you know to you know one of the things that I couldn't do in a way to save myself because they didn't want they being far need to address it yes\nAh may I couldn't save myself cabin or did\n... or we had a ... I turned it does look like a rock Joe Manchin has voted yes on Kavanaugh\nSays that means that having a that mansions gonna vote to confirm him mhm\nAnd the reason Manchin is doing that is because if he voted against having all that he might lose the election\nI Wonder if the west Virginia Mountain Dew period\nWe do have one no vote from Lisa Murkowski the Murkowski it out a mansion in playing in Collins is in a this would you should be enough for him to get confirmed\nHere because if it's a tie a pen breaks it correct Murkowski if Murkowski votes against Kavanaugh she's through in the Republican Party she's finished yeah I won't get a nickel\nI'm from any Republican and I believe that she her Senate career will be over I think of the people of Alaska very conservative state will throw her out\nDo you think Joe or do you think a bill that we have with a um with Murkowski the situation where she knew it was going to go through we wanted to vote no was able to vote no because she knew they had the fifty votes\n[noise] doesn't matter just a no vote going against every single one of her colleagues\nMhm\nIsolates her and puts her as a poli a word of the day polite [laughter]\nUh and the Republican Party\nSaying\nThat that's an amazing situation I didn't think Murkowski was put her entire career risk ... over this but um apparently she yeah\nShe could vote yes tomorrow how\nHow though if she's voting not to advance the nomination to the floor\nNow it's an allergy vote yes I Want to confirm it because I didn't think that it should go\nOh it's gone forward and so now I'm going to because\nA lot of people are calling my office and I'm afraid I'm afraid for my career I Do I'm going to vote yes\nMaybe but I uh that's a pretty tough line and\nYeah I don't think he's going to do it but it is interesting point him in that one of the most shocking vote result of that I can remember my entire lifetime was Lisa Murkowski beating Joe Miller on a write in ballots\nAre in that Senate campaign in several years ago does Alaska reward Murkowski after this with another election I mean I don't think so I think so\nAnd so they are very independent they are conservative but they're very independent or and we'll wait and see Bill thanks so much Bill O'Reilly dot of a good weekend ... ... talk to you next week alright [noise] let me tell you about the greatest chair of all time it is\nThe next year or the next year is a an office chair I have for uh my other studio we had to get another chair for the studio\nBought the next year they have become advertisers are in the in the around the same time and now we have them in here as well ...

bipartisan agreement on opioids the vote was Ninety eight\nTo one in the Senate and the one vote was Mike Lee he was the no\nOn the bill in and mad if that doesn't make me hesitated and wonder what the hell is then they'll you know I mean I Know yeah you nervous I mean if Michael ... is not like Mike Lee ... drug victims right and I can I just\nSay I'm Sorry pat as a guy who lives in excruciating pain in his whole life as me a guy who has woken up on the operating table they cannot keep me down my body doesn't process that stuff\nLike other people and I've woken up in the middle of surgery scared the hell out of the anesthesiologist but but woken up they can't keep they take it takes ... to keep me down so\nAh I sure do appreciate those drugs so yeah I just did an interview with um [noise]\nOh shoot from the five he's a friend of ours are ... ... ... did the first interview with him about his son and opioids and everything else it say how our full powerful interview\nBut his stance now is those all should be banned they should not make them all the old opioid any opioids should be banned should not be even a\nVeil a little to anybody I disagree with that is so wrong yeah it was summer example a ... it may have ... to live in\nIt it makes life miserable yeah you can you can handle getting through your daily activities otherwise you'd be curled up in a ball and pain somewhere and you'd ... you'd you'd end up killing your uh usually would horrific yeah yeah\nOr if you if you don't have that I mean it doesn't even it doesn't even negate all the pain it just may not care yeah you just don't carry your skill\nIn pain you just don't care as\nManaging and there does seem to be a legitimate medical use for a lot of people to use opioids in that if\nYou do get a different than you you can get addicted to oil they kept it and you can do your body it's only normal your body gets addicted and it helps to get off of it\nI don't know about you but my doctors are really vigilant on by their ... and oh my gosh what they are a big gotten ... absolutely not see ask about it\nI Know your doctor because we we have the same back Dr and we were talking about it and I I always bring you up 'cause he's always when I bring you up ... because I'll always say patties in so much and he's like I think he's one of the worst\nPain patients that I have he's like I I don't know how he does it um and so we always talk about it and he's told me that his his the government is coming down on opioids hard you know it's like I don't know how people like pat are going to really I mean yeah it's going to be hard it's going to be hard\nAnd they're you know you got to do drug testing of almost every time now almost every time you had to make sure you're not doctor shopping I guess and getting drugs from somebody else and you don't have anything in your system but what's supposed to be there almost every time I go I get a drug test seriously\nHa ha ... and ... interesting allegation right yeah the idea that different doctors would have different approaches to a particular medical ailment is not surprising right like\nYou would go to a doctor because you think they're treating it better than maybe somebody else no there's no doctor shopping I well that's what that what I'm saying in the search for doctor shopping allegations can sometimes encompass some people who are yeah who are young something legitimate yeah\nYeah but there are a lot of people who will go and try to get you know whatever they can from somebody or their their pernicious drugs but it's like anything is the Internet bad no right it can be it can be\nAre are these opioids bad and you know be it can be I mean it's it's like anything with real power\nAnd in the hands of each human you have the choice you can use them to alleviate pain or you can use them the way they're not supposed to be used and it's a very hard thing but you just gotta be rock solid and it it it is hard it's really hard\nYeah but banning them is a it just is not a good idea to its again\nProhibition you know the drug war than not the way you deal with it [noise]\nWhy am I doing hopefully some
