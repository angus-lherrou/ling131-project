about the um the caravan coming from a Honduras\nThey're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nWe got to start putting ourselves into shoes or other people we've got to start thinking about the consequences that others suffer enough we've been spared those by the grace of God let us be let us be appreciative let us count are blessed that he stopped and let us take\n'em anymore bill we're within six hours my crack team found out who these people were what the real intention was a and the the press and John Case they still are just say no no no the good people\nYou want to talk a little bit about uh the Caribbean\nYeah I'm a first of all I Know case it's a long time he used to a sub for me once in a while on or a factor on a Fox I'm a good man\nA very sincere that nice job running a Ohio but John is a theoretical\nGuy he's not\nA real world guy and people want to know that so he basically saying Americans we have to put ourselves\nThe position of somebody in Honduras who uh is poor and oppressed because the society down there as violent and out of control okay\nBut then what is the point of that exercise governor case that we allow everyone in Honduras to come to Ohio\nEveryone\nIn the same thing with all the poor countries and the world because that's what your spouse thing\nBy saying that the caravan people should be allowed to seek asylum in the United states that's what you're saying everyone can come here and do that\nWe would lead a ballot for night now California would be a foreign country within Eighteen months\nRight three year backlog right now of asylum I'm\nA hearings and if you apply you are in the country you're here for three years at least okay what do you do arrow who does fifty percent of all immigrant families both illegal and legal are on means tested welfare\nSo there's a one out of two chance that the American taxpayers are going to have to pick up some of your bills twenty two trillion dollar debt right now for the usa so if you look at the unintended consequences of John ... six vision of compassion\nNot compassionate all you're basically wrecking a system that does provide true opportunity for three hundred and twenty million Americans should they do what they need to do to succeed you reckon that system governor case it do you not understand that\nSee I can and that's the debate I mean I just crush them in the bay 'cause he would have no answer for any of that\nBill tell me who's behind this who's financing this\nWell I Do believe it's the progressive crew um the George Soros people\nUm because that was done it in the past that we did a big thing on Bill O'Reilly dot com last night about Soros after CBS glorified and\nWe said no I'm the he's pumping in two thousand Eighteen this year alone tens of millions of dollars into the worst organizations and by that I mean they attack and smear anyone they disagree with David Brock runs one of them\nThat's the media matters guy and I don't tell me that's you know this was a benevolent man so I Believe that these\nKinds of people I Can't prove it because there's no accountability and Honduras but I Believe they're behind a big ... big money behind as everybody knows\nA bill I and I invite you to read what even the president of ... saying I'm this is this is backed by a cube of ah Venezuela a and ousted president of Honduras\nAre that are blaming the United states for all of the unrest ah the former president says that ah America's gonna have to pay for all of this or they'll have to accept our citizens this is just an ongoing internal battle\nOr in Honduras that has quite honestly lied to many of their people\nUm and said that America's gonna have to take you and they're going to because they're responsible for this mess this is a Marxist a revolutionary\nUh that uh has tried to take Honduras by force the Supreme Court two branches of their government\nFound what he was doing to be unconstitutional and kicked him out and he's been causing problems ever since and now he Venezuela in Cuba are together and what was formerly known is all about but they are his to the United states and they're the ones financing at least the beginning of it\nThat's how it started now sorrows or others may be involved but I haven't seen any evidence of that yet but I Would not put it past them\nRight and and it would be interesting to see if there is a pipeline of cash going into the kid to goose ... so this is what I say I'm skeptical of everything and I agree with you there has been no hard evidence put forth of George Soros or people like him did this but if you know it's it's\nOne of history's things they've done in the past yes but the the government of Honduras should\nBe able to trace ... foreign money coming into that country back they should be able to show people this is what has arrived here\nSo I Hope they do that if they if they believe Cuba and Venezuela are actively involved in subverting their own country on doors and and by extension hurting the usa they have the ability to find that out\nMay be but there's all the ... the Mexican government does not want that\nAll right they don't they ... they don't want that got problems on the border um ... you know war is one of the worst places in the world Tijuana right behind they don't want all this because it drains their infrastructure I mean this is an environmental disaster for Mexico\nThese people only facilities that they are the water they need food Mexican people are poor\nThere's not the infrastructure to support their so yeah\nSo how would love shantytowns there with ... mothers and babies and look at the United states they're rich and look at these people and let them in short but the Mexican government I'm telling you is under tremendous pressure by the Trump Administration not to allow any of this to happen\nSo so um how did you move seven to fourteen thousand people and just find enough water how is this not a humanitarian crisis\nIt is I asked her but they have it set up where by there are tens who paid for those tents\nYou in the media would care now [laughter] you\nDon't know it all I Want to know no pictures of the poor baby and you know older and you know but the mother no no no building you know they care so much about the humanitarian side of the ... you might think that they would find out is there enough baby formula yeah who is paying for it\nRight or ride it look we've been over ... over this we don't have a a a on us press in America anymore which is enormous story that is not being covered by the decide this president going to cover themselves\nSo these guys like you and me we do it but you know there most of the American people feel that we do have a functioning on us press and we don't\nWant any level let me ask you this there was a story out this week and I know you touched on it about the one in for college students were in Korea all distress I Know in response to the Trump election twenty five percent said they felt like they had P. T. S. D.\nYeah this is at Arizona State university um and in Tempe um and and look it just an ongoing indicator that there is a segment of the American population are under the age of thirty\nWho cannot cope with life and that's why you're seeing the rise of opioids are opioids you seeing this whole thing it all plays into\n... we just can't handle it yeah\nWe can handle any stress no stress so I didn't have any you know we we have Mike Rowe aggression I Know I'm offended by a sign I'm offended by a speaker I'm offended by a hat I there's a frog over there yeah offends\nMan [laughter] you know Matt and when they have children like Josh they're not going to be able to get up in the morning\nAh it's\nBut those people will fail they will fail in our system is our system not going to change is going to be competitive it's going to be self reliance that the progress has would love to change it but\nIt's not going to change in our lifetime and these people who have all of this anxiety about Donald Trump being present or whatever else it may be are going to fail in the marketplace\nGoing to give you an opportunity to address Megan Kelly anything to say about making Kelly\nI think I was kinder to Megan Kelly than any other person in the news business as you well know\nUm we featured her and on my program in a segment called the Kelly file which became her a name of her program when she got one\nUm we've promoted her and the beginning I thought she was a very honest you know great talent and did what I always do I helped her a long\nSubsequently um she turned out to be not a very nice person to me and many others at Fox\nMany others and went on her way and now it's not looking so good but\nI I'm a civic lean how young wants to revel in anybody's a discomfort or I don't like

Donald Trump responsible for this as any logical person that ever seen anything to do with our legal system would be able to do with um but you know again this is we we're not gonna know enough about this this is but this is a product\nBut maybe even a couple of maybe not going to write three you're pushing it us\nThree hundred bumper stickers covering all of your windows you are not convincing anyone to your viewpoint I think you know people because of it\nI don't know if you have an ACOA you're you're you're going to be kicked out yeah you're going to they're going to tell you to move because you're a spoof to death all of the neighbors\nEven the navy you could be living in the most\n... you could be living in a neighborhood with the holy family ... and the pope and all of the pro life activist from all the time right\nAnd you could drive one of those crazy anti abortion bans into your driveway and those people are going to say you know we have standards yeah you're nuts\nI just really hope if Jesus comes back he's not in the van [laughter]\nYou know I'm a white van with you about your bumper stickers people are not going to buy it they're just like I don't believe that guy there is no way back like that and again you're not supposed to know what's coming right or maybe that's how that's how he says he comes back maybe that's how the anti Christ comes from that I Would yeah [laughter] well no no no that wouldn't be slick enough you would have you know he'd\nBe oh my gosh well\nPlug yours too okay he'd be the guy who would try to say we should round up all the people out of hand [laughter] anti Christ would be the first one to go [laughter] you know these people are nuts\nI Would be a good suspects I normally around him and his wife ... relevant for and why do we care so now It's Tuesday night rice wine will surely a settlement wow I didn't see that one coming that's like what like the really\nBad like lifetime movies where they're trying to give you the big the big switch through and like it's like a it's a you know it's a rape case and you\nKnow the whole time they put you to this one person and it's a very last second you know a guy she walked by for three seconds in the grocery stores the guy who did it come out of course we didn't see that coming it's a nobody [laughter] well You're welcome on the track [laughter] there you go wow same plot twist\n[laughter] I don't know if I feel comfortable employing the anti Christ so I'm just going to concentrate on the mail bomb suspect that it's just been arrested in Florida\nYeah it's I I cannot believe there's not a journalist who was taking the high quality photo disadvantage\nHouse it's possible they're all zoomed out from you know the helicopters and you can't quite see exactly what it said I Will say you know by all appearances it does appear to be a pro Trump propaganda and now it's it's sort of difficult to see\nYou know like for example a\nThere's a shirt that was around in the elections are a lot that looked like a a Hillary a presidential shirt and then it said a message on dirt that said something like a lock her up twenty twenty or twenty sixteen\nThey get could theoretically be alive anti Trump stuff but I don't think you would think that I'm just trying to say we fish in pretty deep picture I Do this all the time for the uh for the level after you know like you're trying to find okay what is the one\nCircumstance that we can be missing here and maybe that's it but it does seem to be\nA ... in his face in the presidential seal pretty clearly on one of the windows but again you know\nThat the media and try to make this out to be well from ... or you know evil bombers ... you know and and again we didn't do that with all Bernie Sanders supporter no they all people who have ... we didn't say that I was ... going to shoot someone on a on a on a field yeah and that guy was successful that guy actually almost killed people\nThis one didn't there's some didn't\nAnd we didn't say that when we could live with the Bernie Sanders guy\nAnd you know there's a couple of reasons why number one this stuff happens right right wing people do crazy things to there's there's plenty of them on the right as well that there are plenty of crazy does not go to one party when you get these fringe levels there are people on both sides who do it um there's a there's an ideology and we've talked a lot about this that affects many on uh the very harsh left\nGoing back to you know examples like Bill errors in the one the weather underground and we saw this with the Occupy Wall Street where\nThere's some idea ideological reasons why certain types of pilots come from the left more often but still there's crazy people all over the spectrum you just said hey you don't want to do it because your sides probably need some dumb leader and you're gonna get blamed for it but beyond that it's just correct when people people are responsible for their own actions\nYou were an individual you act as an individual and the person who says something that you listen to it was not responsible for how you take that information and how you deal with it not to mention it may or not may have nothing to do with that at all\nYou know just because you happen to be a he happens to be a a a Trump supporter does that make ... make Trump's making Trump's fault that he's doing these terrible thing no and the same thing would apply as it did apply to a Bernie Sanders by the way that just\nA fan but campaign volunteer was actually working to get the guy elected who then went and tried to shoot twenty five Republicans on a baseball field but again not Bernie Sanders fault at all not his fault at fault zero percent ... and the same thing would be it would apply here if this is how this thing turns out I\nTell you there's more to find out I I Will tell you this think how fortunate we are in a couple of things um\nGo back to the bombing of the bridge in Cleveland you remember about that you remember that name remember anybody Mueller bealer you remember when Occupy Wall street was caught by the FBI on their way to the bridge I think they had part of it even wired did they have an even wired\nBut they were going to blow up bridge and Cleveland ah and they had the capability of doing it and thank God the FBI caught them but that never made any news you know it would have made huge news if the Tea Party would have been doing that right but they didn't they\nYou know Occupy Wall street all those are just crazy kids you know they're just they're in the Scooby Doo van there just crazy kids\nUm but seeing how fortunate we are that that didn't happen how that could have torn apart [laughter] think\nAbout the blessings that not a single bomb went off that this guy may have been so damn crazy that he really thought well\nPretty sure ... sand gets\nSo damn crazy that he really thought well I don't have any gunpowder\nBar I'm pretty sure ... sand gets hot\n[laughter] uh you know this guy is I mean you want to talk about incompetent um how fortunate we are that none of these bombs went off if any of these bombs would have gone off and hurt or killed or maimed people from the other side\nThe world would be a different place today the media would be going crazy because look at how they're going crazy\nNow well\nGood news looks like we may have caught the guy yeah\nIt's interesting and now they're starting to yeah we're getting to that point where people are starting to share pictures of what appears to be the van which does appear to be very pro Trump also very pro soccer\nAnd [laughter] it's an odd combination of things to be I Would I Would not assume dons a big soccer fan but who knows a but will ah\nWill tell you these things checkout again everyone roasted soccer people well we said how long have we said that yeah I think we blame a I think we blame the world were up [laughter]\n[noise]\nOh my gosh the world cup\nBooth in

I think these package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say between ... between these crazy right these these national rights groups planting bombs on the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in the selection for the\nFor the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nIt so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're gonna lose they're not going to win the house back Democrats than the deep state they're not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state loses they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way\nYou ... and you really think that the the deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and have the left when in fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean like I said rush three years ago I would've said I'm Crazy I mean I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\nI mean you're talking about some very high profile people being in a lot of trouble\nTheoretically actual\nEvents eventually the gears of justice grind slowly but you'd like to believe that actually some of these people are going to pay for what they've done\nWell wait a minute but why why is it that happening now the Republicans round the house of representatives now why do why do they have to win it again in order to conduct these investigations\nThat Jim Jordan says are coming up\nI think Trump will have more to do with pushing it forward once these elections are over I think there are deep state people on the Republican side who helps slow roll this thing I really do\nI think Trump will be the one ram routing at once these elections are over if he gets the big win because this will be a mandate about him they if they really\nScience museum let's discuss the you think Trump is essentially on the ballot in in this election there is no wrong answer her don't miss

on Trump\nNo doubt about it look at the effect he's having when he goes in campaigns for people in the states that was supposed to be such trouble when the Republicans I think he's definitely I think these people on the left think this was going to be their big moment when they finally damage to this guy and get all their investigation started I think they think this is the beginning of the ...\nAnd I will is something that I was I was reading a a tech blogs yesterday and folks I really appreciate you indulge me talking about this is my hobby not keeping up with the blockers meant keeping up with the\nTech and to keep up with the tech yeah have to read the stuff and\nIt's all written by among the young millennial\nJournalist and they have ever since election day two thousand six day and they haven't been in various stages of\nPanic and I I'm a ...\nThere was a reference in one of the tech blogs to a poll showing the red wave of the blue wave was not going to happen and it was not nearly as big and this particular blogger was in a mile to panic about it\nWriting about you know what we all have been thinking that what happened in two thousand sixteen was an odd confluence of events that that gave us a one off result that's not really representative of America that Donald Trump and these Republicans is not who we are\nAnd then the guy says\nBut if the Republicans hold the house of representatives and we're gonna have to come to grips with this is who we are and that we are not running the show in truth\nAnd it was it was um it was like I wouldn't say there was panic and end up reading the written word but it's slowly dawning on some of the last two years they have live with the belief\nThat what happened in two thousand sixteen\nWas unusual irregular a one off that it shouldn't have happened it was an odd confluence of events of bad candidates with the\nHillary Clinton and so forth over confidence by people on the left but that um people had been waiting every day for these two years to fix this mistake and the Democrats are going to storm the ballot boxes on Tuesday in November and correct dismissing now they're starting to begin to quite\nMaybe this is not an oddity navy navy we're not the majority\nAnd it kind of dovetails with what you're saying here do you believe for example that a\nTrump voters and Republican voters right now are actually losing momentum to vote because of his mom's now\nGo rush can I share something with you here I went yeah Trump rally I went on a Trump rally two weeks ago it was in I was in Council Bluffs right across the river\nAnd I think the uh mid America center seats\nI went out a Trump rally two weeks ago it was an I was in Council Bluffs right across the river and I think the uh mid America center seats for this event it was like twelve thousand I'm not exaggerating there had to about twenty five thousand people outside there in that line\nThere were more women than there were men and women are going Americans and they were nice people but I'm telling you there were a lot of these protesters\nAnd my instinct was I Want to say something to these protesters when I got down there\nLike me and many other people we don't want to start trouble with that it's like we don't have the inclination to get in their faces an act like they do and so many of these Trump supporters are not the kinds of people that are wearing it on their sleeves right now it's just going to go in and poke how how could you hold against the guy is doing such wonderful things for the\nCountry I mean he really is and I think\nA lot of those people are just going to go in there and they're going to vote because they now realize that they got the momentum on their side but they're not the kinds of people that are out there wearing an under sleeves like these crazy radical leftist are all doing\nWell it is it is a it it's standard\nOld conventional wisdom thinking that people voting impulses or energy or desires ebb and flow like this\nI mean the idea that this week a bomb scare stories can dampen enthusiast I I I don't I don't think that describes the average Trump voter I think the average Trump voter is immune\nTo all of that and more maybe I think more than the average Trump voter I I I don't think they have to be told how important the election is I don't think they have to be reminded to vote I don't think they need to be told the stakes\nAnd yet there are people that continues you got to drive turnout Russia got to tell people how important it is I think they already know I I'm I'm\nI don't sense that there is a usual\nLessening of enthusiasm or a gaming of enthusiasm based on the ebb and flow of news I think people understand how important it is it was it's as important now is it wasn't two thousand sixteen in fact\nIt may even be more important now that Trump is in office and policies have been enacted the idea of this stuff needs to continue or maybe more important like Trump said at one of his rallies\nI think the ... the rally in Houston He was talking about how he he produced he's got he's got a track record now\nIs it two years ago on the campaign I was saying we're going to do this we're going to be great again we're going to stop this we're going to make a trade deals better but back then it was just words that\nWas just words but now two years later I produced meeting is not just words it's real now and I think from soldiers supporters understand this I I just think they're immune to the um uh attempts\nThat are made elsewhere to his spirit them a or to somehow we can ... and so we'll see a it won't be long haired Jimmy I'm Glad you called thanks for the extended time we'll be back after\nThis doesn't hold back the news you need
