I Do think many people who are coming out is transgender nowadays probably have some other psychiatric condition that isn't being diagnosed because\nClinicians aren't able to do their job properly so if someone comes into your clinic and says that they are transgender I don't work with patients anymore but um if someone comes in Allen says that they're transgender a clinician really does have to take that at face value they're not really allowed to to ask\nHer questions because I've seen a trend Celtic so I think nowadays because it's seen as very trendy to trends\nThat can be part of it and so if someone who has another form of psychopathology it's manifesting is something that has to do gender even a gender thing to do with it um but with regards to why transitioning shouldn't be seen as something beneficial in research that show\nFor some people that can help I Do think if others things happened ruled out that it\nCan be beneficial for somebody on I think ultimately adults should be free to do what they want with your\nBody so so do I don't get me wrong so do I but I I I think what a a I was getting to and you just answered is\nWith this trends phobia of this this uh just hurting everybody into Ashville questions is dangerous it's just dangerous for people\nAnd and we we should look in the end you're an adult you get to do what you want to do and I'm fine with that but just the silencing of thought and in this case science and medicine is is terrifying\nYeah but I mean going back to the difference between gender disorienting something like anorexia with people who are gender just for their brains has been partially either not school and I are feminine I\nWrite in the direction I got out of that\nThe gender they identify as right the thing is these studies that show\nThat in the brain how are also conflated with sexual orientation so if you have a study on trans women say so these are people who are born male that identifies female they are also attracted for the most part two men so when you do these brain studies we're still not clear on\nThe differences we're seeing are due to then identifying females or do to them being sexually attracted to that because there are very strong neural correlate that are associated with sexual orientation so that's the other thing that people aren't talking about is that this has a lot to do with sexual renting\nAre very strong neural correlate are associated with sexual orientation that that's the other thing that people are talking about it that it has a lot to do with sexual orientation and K.

mixed right now there was another fall by the way I'm an ... you know um some polls are showing that Cruz a real race even tighter so I don't know I mean\nIt it was interesting to hear Sean Spicer talked about it because Spicer as you would know is that you know it was the original spokesperson\nFor Donald Trump or and became famous for that but has a very long ... long military career and he was a he was a very much a a you know a Washington insider really knew the behind the scenes politics of it and you hear him talking about politics he knows this stuff you can rattle off these races like nobody\nElse is from the latest podcast the news and why it matters if you are deeply don't subscribe to that it's a about a forty five minutes a thing every on your way home you can listen to a and it's me and it's a stew spat it's a Sarah Gonzales and uh also sometimes a gas like yesterday with Sean Spicer\nUh and it's just to kind of a fun look at the news here's here's what Sean Spicer said yesterday just a little bit of what he said about the this election\nThe problem is that their base the vocal minority of their base keeps dragging them so far in the left that they kind of have to keep\nFumbling passed each other to outdo each other to prove who is the most ... ... and that's the biggest problem that we have right now for the Democrats and said the ... they have been the biggest helpers to the Republican Party over ... because like going so far to the left in trying to ... this this law which is what it really is\nThey've lost the ability to talk about things and I don't know [laughter] um [noise] they they for most pragmatic traditional Democrat\nThey feel like the party so far left them\nI actually think he might heavy turnout problem you're talking about it with the Latino community now\nI think the Democrat is ironic it may sound may actually lose the enthusiasm gap by big margin heading into the ... midterms because a lot of these folks are saying why they they've now exposed and they really are this isn't about fighting for workers' rights are environmental causes that we've cared about for so long\nAnd this isn't about impeachment investigation I don't know that I bought in on that if you're a traditional Democrat and I think that they look at the Republican who haven't focused on a pretty pragmatic agenda of economic growth low unemployment\nDeregulate tearing down the deregulatory state\nAnd I you know I'm not sure I'm a Republican but I kind of agree with that agenda\nSo when the dust settles how many Republican senators are fifty five fifty five and I think if if he called me into a high you are wrong is fifty six [laughter] it'll it'll be okay with that but I I think that the way it's going now got a fifty one forty nine majority I yeah I I\nActually think Florida is going to go Republican I'm Nelson as governor Scott's going to be income and center now than I think there's no question in Indiana and North Dakota in the\nBag and then I think I mean North Dakota point yeah but I haven't but Indiana that's another story I mean that's how I think Indiana I ended up for it but it's ... look\nI've been in politics

must be ice skating on the lake so fire and held today [noise] because hell has frozen over a ... a member of the media\nHas now actually admitted that he shouldn't have dismissed Juanita Broderick accusation against the bill Clinton now this is coming from a columnist for the Washington Post where his name is Richard Cohen he's worked at the post inspecting sixty eight\n[noise] and he just wrote an opinion piece titled I thought Juanita Broderick wasn't credible\nI was wrong\nNow Juanita Broderick is the woman who alleges that Bill Clinton raped her when he was running for Arkansas governor in Nineteen Seventy eight but since the me too movement exploded over a year ago there's been a title shift in the culture culminating in the tug of war over allegations during the Kavanaugh hearings\nNow what are the biggest takeaways from those hearings according to those on the left is that you always must believe the victim\nDuring the hearings Anita Hill was once again in the spotlight brought up over and over again and her accusations against Clarence Thomas universally believed by the media yet somehow some of Bill Clinton's accusers still haven't been extended the same sympathy as Dr Blasey Ford and need a hill\n... that's really why is it so unusual to hear a Bill Clinton supporter admit that they may have been wrong about Broderick\nTwenty years later\nNow this has been obviously influenced by the me too movement\nBut Cohen now admits to dismissing Broderick claims during the Clinton presidency is just another wild accusation made by twisted Clinton haters\nNBC's Lisa Myers recently told slate I tested Broderick story every way I could again and again and again I'm quoting and no detail ever changed it never got better it never got worse it was always the same and quote\nCohen ... now wonders why Monica Lewinsky is now totally characterized as a victim while Broderick is ignored\nIsn't that interesting\nMonica Lewinsky who has always say she says she wasn't a victim\nIs now the victim and Broderick who is always claimed it was not consensual I was raped\nShe's ignored Cohen says it might have something to do with Broderick bring being a Trump supporter come on I couldn't have anything to do with it going writes\nI remember refusing to deal with the Broderick allegations because I simply chose to believe Clinton was not a rapist my position has proved naive\nMe ask you a question\nUnlike Broderick who had all of the evidence had witnesses unlike Keith Ellison who the witness is very credible has nothing to gain everything to lose the evidence\nIs overwhelming those two things you can look at\nAnd you can say there's evidence there you're ... you chose to ignore it with Kavanaugh there was no evidence but if suddenly there was a bunch of evidence and it was presented\nI Would be fine with saying wow okay new information looks like Kavanaugh did it\nWhy is it that no one on the left is willing to do that\n\nWhether dealing with Clinton or the Kavanaugh cases all political camps should tread carefully\nTheir certainty about the truth certainty always seems to get us into trouble\nRequires a huge dose of something more elusive than the truth to be able to survive today and that is humility Cohen seems to be exercising humility\nAnd for that I think the Washington Post columnist\nThank you for being willing to step out of the crowd go against maybe some of your peers and say you know what I think we were wrong about this one thank you Richard Cohen\nIs a pretty big moment we recently went over the details that Broderick accusation like to have her um\nYeah she she would come on I think she it was interesting to see that because I honestly the same thing had a similar reaction to it at the time or in which a lot of the accusations about affairs and stuff seem to be credible but you know rapists I mean the the accusation was really brutal\nOr by the time she had five corroborating witnesses that she told at the time\nOr she talked about seeing a I think it was a prison\nOr in the outside of the window ... um which was confirmed that prison with there she was confirmed to be at the nursing Congress that was there he was in town like I mean there was a lot of it was on like the she knew that she knew what hotel was at\nPlayboy magazine right [laughter] you know what I mean you had to shame you're going to like if I'm you know like concrete no windows and like your car would be there and be like all very goes into ... store like no and it's and it's not\nThat way now now he is the worst of the worse now it's degrading\nI knew that are easy to get up every ... everywhere and and the ... and the real\nShocking that Glenn is not only is that the case with technology and the prevalence but\nAmong young people where it's most prevalent Eighteen to twenty four year old men now the numbers show that\nThey view it as a morally acceptable choice or indifferent to it a majority so so what can I tell you something\nI mean you're a guy\nYou're being told you can't look at women are sexually you can't notice what they're wearing you a rape is completely undefined I mean you know\nI asked you out you said no I asked you out a second time and now ... you know I'm a ... [laughter] I mean it's it's crazy and confusing and I don't know you know as a as a twenty something boy or a Seventeen year old boy\nWell anyway\nPlus and who would argue with consequences free right like it's just yeah I don't have um I'm not getting real that by anybody I'm not getting in trouble with anybody I mean\nIt's round I went for it not consequence for it right yeah not at all um I mean the the pastors that are in the score some\nYou may remember glad I don't know if you know Doug Wilson but he um he got famous because he was debating Christopher Hitchens he went around and he was the he was the apologist version of politics that went around with him and and so and so he lays that all out about how you know destructive this really is to relationships and how is the silent killer\nBecause there's a stigma with with pornography like if you go into you know your church is your testimony and there's some sort of\nYou know like a drug addiction or something like that you know there's a lot of sympathy for you and and people you know roll out the record but there's you know if you come up and you're the poor guy right now it's like you don't how many how many how many times have you seen that testimony or church I have never seen it right and so and so\nAnd actually the numbers and the studies show that even church leaders are are falling victim to to this so I Know there's a reason why they're not bringing it up there there's a fear that they're going to be found out too\nI Know in you know in in in my church\nAnd you know my church is a good way to to you know [laughter] I don't do we drink milk [laughter] um it it's the number one reason families are breaking up is the number one cause of of problem is pornography and it starts out as pornography and it just spirals out of control\nThey too if you're if you're ... you know if you're having a porn addiction issue like you're probably not going to want to stand up and front you're right because the stigma is big I think it's interesting about what you've done here is like ... that the same way that\nThe the negatives of what has happened with porn which is the stigma has been taken away 'cause you could just do it on line and your own right like this course that you have is kind of think it takes away the stigma of having to admit it necessarily you can kind of go through and and here these things without having to stand up in front of your shirt I don't tell your neighbors\nAbout it I mean I Know you're ready I Know it's really I Know it's I understand the stigma\nBut it's the same kind of stigma as you would have as a as an alcoholic twenty five years ago you have to um there's it is\nThis is natural as you said God gave us the sex drive and it is different between men and women and men are driven by their eyes it didn't we just are we're very visual women or not is visual as we are when it comes to sex and so there's\nIt's it's normal media normal yeah you would have this Dr what makes us not an animal is trying to say okay some of that is good some of the too much of this is bad right right\nAnd and what we're doing is like I said we're pressing the reset button and showing you where God has laid out because cultures on so off the rails and that's part of that's been infused in the church I mean even the stuff you let inside\nYou know the stuff we allow ourselves to watch I mean as you can talk about pornography and say oh hard core pornography yes that's pornography but where do you watch it on ... which feeds are you looking at I mean there's Instagram not like\nThe women in bikinis showing their buttons right now I mean like only when I got in the rain when you're just rolling that all the way through I mean given that be considered part I think I think some people can make that case it make a strong case\nThis is an argument that the movie you know my wife and I have all the time a because there's almost nothing that you could watch on you know Netflix or Amazon yeah\nThat unless it's an old TV series or something there's almost nothing that you can watch that doesn't have this\nYou know so you know click click click you know go ahead and and um you know fast forward through some of that crap and that's the argument is on my wife like don't stop watching we have ... honey let's just ... head of this part you\nKnow but [laughter]\nIs that right right is that right you know it's not because it is of course like how does it have our recommendations for filters is it about that type of\nThing with me and we ... we mentioned those things because they are good like having Internet filters and in our town ability partners you know things are good but what we do is we really just tried to get to the heart of it because those things are bandied they're they're right the Bible says our hearts are deceitful above all out and so it's\nYour your heart's gonna find a way if you're still desiring that your heart's gonna find a way around your filter you're going to find another device you're going to know how to do this and that to get around it can we ... we tried to rewire your heart and show you what God will give you a positive vision to shoot for you can't just say don't do it right do it right give me some of the stats\nUm while I'm you know two thirds of all Christian men have you'd porn\nMonthly they admit that I I Would assume too that if that's the admitted number it's\nTitled we I mean that's probably I actually just to hold on higher I think it was something like I don't have one in six\nChurch leaders have admitted to struggling with this is that's church while you're six and so you know nine percent of churches only ... only nine percent of churches actually have resources dedicated and and I and I believe because it is it's just you know me\nSort of projecting this you know I'm guessing this but because of that and the ramp and you know numbers that are here I think that there's probably a little bit of fear and somebody\nThe sort of projecting this you know I'm guessing this but because of that and the ramp and you know numbers that are here I think that there's probably a little bit of fear and some of these leaders because they feel hypocritical you know coming out and saying let's fight this thing because they know they're struggling with with themselves but I'll give you one more um\nAh kids are being exposed to porn I mean my kids went on Syria the other day and actually said something and they miss entered Syria misunderstood and came back with like a sexual thing um and my son was like what's that all about Mm I'm so kids are accidentally or intentionally getting exposed to pornography as young as ten and eleven years old\nAnd they're getting married later so now think about that if you start getting into port at ten eleven twelve years old and it becomes a habit for you um and then you don't get married until you're twenty eight twenty nine years old you've been poisoning your brain now in how you view women for ... you know two thirds of your life who thirds of your life\nAnd an hour and it gets people to to be a good husband and it\nTakes more and more\nTo excite you yes I mean it just it is a gateway hit the gateway did you start with porn and and we we look at it fairs and that the other thing that ... where does that usually start it didn't start just one day you wake up and say I'm going to have an affair with my secretary [laughter] started in the house and your phone\nYou know and like and we can talk about this but I guarantee our voices right now we're hitting the numbers don't lie the numbers don't lie we're hitting you were not hitting a neighbor were not hitting somebody else I guarantee you there's somebody sitting in their car listening to this and edits hitting home right now because it's the silent killer and you've been walking around with that would\nThat shame and guilt and so that's why we made this course set free course dot com because you know God wants you to be free from this he he wants you to live in you know shame free guilt free from this and he's given you the tools to fight it and so that's what we want to thank you very much Dan thank you thank you for having me\nYeah he gets doing something with his life [laughter]\nSet free courses dot com is the place to go get it and the Israel thing is coming up to where we got the ... documentary I was talking to Dan a little bit earlier today about some of the experiences of seeing the media as they covered the Palestinians versus the way they cover the is there wasn't an old to go over there now over the media and yet that's what this documentary became because\nThe media was if you didn't stay with the gaggle\nYou actually knew actually observe something above the gaggle yeah that they're just never aware\nOf wall and and even more shocking line is when the guy goes there they get the story wrong\nI mean it was unbelievable to me you know 'cause we went there to watch from you know actually do what the other presidents didn't do and and open the the us embassy there in in Jerusalem and so um that's what we were therefore but then what we saw with how the media can talk to the narrative that's completely false\nI'm at I'll I'll tell you a quick story of you know for some some contacts I downloaded it out while I was there called red alert\nAnd so you can try this at home and test it and see if I'm if I'm I'm full of it\nBut it's called red alert and what it does it you know you know

was that these rockets were getting shot in Israel all the time\nAnd you know and then they might be a show that the picture like there's the contact like their rockets are flying in from Gaza all the

power back as ... grams had south it's just I just I think a lot to be honest\nI only I Am so I I'm I'm I'm happy to hear you say that with events like this happen I always wonder what the\nAh reaction is going to be from people who are actively engaged in in these events each and every day and informed about them and the reaction gives me a gives me great solace and comfort because your reaction is pure commonsense if somebody really wanted to hurt somebody with a bomb there's ways to do it this is not how you do at this these bombs haven't gone off these are pipe bombs\nSome of them are large some of them are small we don't yet know what was in the ... with shrapnel what was it tax was it nails was it a shot when we don't we don't know any of this yet none of these bombs what have been capable of taking out a building they were not big enough to be\nBombs into structural damage if they went off they could have killed some people are given their size so but none of them did go off and they were discovered a mostly and distribution centers by the by the post office and\nI'll tell you what if this is real Tania if this is real\nWhoever did this is going to be named by the end of the week and we're going to know who it is I agree if you if it's really at\nThis point I felt this trucking people I wouldn't put it past and they pay somebody off I really do distressing and the Democrats um so anyway we have a lot of what ... what else they put out there and that\nWas exactly exactly this is why I was telling people back in June and July to polls you really don't matter a hill of beans I think however the polls now do not so much in accurately without any doubt predicting a winter but the\nPolls today can be highly influential and decisions and\nAction taken by political people now I just I I Love Tonya thank you very much for uh for calling\nA ... and again for mentioning Bob foreign it really is one of the finest dies anybody could ever meet [noise] ah\nI look at the psychology of people and I'm not a trained psychologist but I Am fairly experienced here at analyzing predicting understanding the left\nAnd I know their mind set on many things one of their mindset on power is that it's there's that that they are entitled to it\nAnd whatever it is denied them by way of elections they really really resented and they resent the people who made it happened which are the voters\nSo today's American leftist angry as it can be at peace\nReally resented and they resent the people who made it happened which are the voters\nSo today's American Left as angry as it can be at people who voted for Trump the hatred for Trump is actually directed at hatred for people who elected him and compounding hatred when those people will not abandon them the left is making every\nEvery effort it can to distance Trump voters from Trump they've tried everything they know how to use to damage Trump to force him out of office divorce Kavanaugh out of the nomination to try to convince Trump voters they made a mistake none of it's work the degree of frustration they are feeling\nIs something you and I cannot relate to\nWe can try but the degree of frustration they're feeling at having lost that election in two thousand sixteen when they thought it was a landslide victory\nAnd subsequently everything they've had the most powerful influential people in their movement all coordinated working together to destroy Donald Trump\nAnd it's been like you know spit balls at a at a at a battleship they haven't Denton Trump I cannot tell you how frustrated they are it is easy for them to\nTake out Republicans whenever they want they are able to do it and if not take them out damage them tremendously\nBut they haven't been able to even score on Trump salt they began this movement of promoting\nIn the media that there was going to be a blue wave they created this movement based on the fact they ... they created a whole cloth something that did\nNot exist a national attitude of hatred for Donald Trump they simply\nTook their own attitude and they transferred it to a majority of Americans for all intents and purposes and then began reporting the news that way\nEverybody hates Trump that now that they've seen Trump an action they hate him to despise him they regret voting for him they wish they could get their vote back that became a narrative that's been the narrative for two years that narrative is what led them to hide things blue wave\nThat it was the only common sense view and a half now that now that people seem trumpet action they've seen is bad manners they've seen whatever is about in the left tastes now everybody's seen it now they regret it now they can't wait to get rid of Trump every special election every Democrat was going to win it because why everybody hated Trump everybody hated themselves were voting for him\nWell it isn't coming to pass\nThe blue wave they said the existed maybe never has the blue wave based on people who hate Trump now they've seen him in action can't wait to vote against them now we're learning much of that was made up much of that with soap operas scripted media narrative\nNow we're getting down to the nitty gritty now or two weeks away from the election and there isn't a blue wave of Republicans look like they're going to gain seats in the Senate even in Democrat Paul's and the blue wave in the house is looking iffy iffy and now with Republican turnout\nDwarfing Democrat turn out in early voting early voting is where the Democrats get to run their frog schemes faults early voting is rubbing illegals vote and the debt vote and all these other things it's purposely set up and the Republicans\nWhy it appears that more sophisticated than Democrats ever considered the Republicans are not letting the Democrats get away with what they usually get away with\nThe Republicans were showing up in droves they're out performing at political rallies Trump won twenty thousand people Fifteen thousand people another twenty five thousand people outside block Obama can't even draw one thousand Joe Biden Hillary Clinton can't draw flies there is ab jet panic\nSetting and now you got this caravan coming up and the Democrats have missed played this caravan even the creepy porn star lawyer Michael ... is tweeting that the Democrats are blowing the way they're reacting to this caravan\nSomething has to happen to change this\nSo Tanya and her instincts in Atlanta I totally totally\nWholeheartedly it will be back in may and in the afternoon rush muggy
