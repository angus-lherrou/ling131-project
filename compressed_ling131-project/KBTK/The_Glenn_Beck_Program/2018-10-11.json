to get nonsense published in peer reviewed uh and uh\nAnd you and you you know you were hoping maybe to get one but you had seven in a year and some of the topics were insane which one where you are responsible for\nWell I I took part in all of them I I listen I took the lead on on one ... Chen ... when the judge Sonia which was a bit shaky but and wait\nI'll get that that there is not acceptable way to criticize a social justice scholarship and activism and that anybody who mock potato or they decide what they do or a hoax academic hoax of it was trying to possess them and and\nThe privilege and that one was accepted quite quicksand and was apparently a as an accent a contribution\nTo [laughter] so but you don't you you you guys found out that you couldn't just published nonsense exactly yet as you pointed out\nRight you you you you actually had to um to join in on the on the grievance club is that is that accurate\nYes he is really have to understand and navigate a complex arrangement of\nOf rules so it is that we couldn't say anything that was was crazy but we had to stay there recently within the joke than this developing body as Siri say sometimes yes we take a mad idea like and\nI'm going to take home pay among adults with the whole train humans in the same men like dogs and\nThen we'd have to find some way to make this to the theory and in that case we looked at San assumptions about implicit bias and claimed that we could read it in humans and interactions with dogs and that was that the hook\nThat enabled us to build and I love to see a way to support this this plane and Fritz accepted and then on that does exemplary scholarship\nI Believe ... what was what was the hum you took Adolf Hitler's mine\nCalm and and how much of that tax did you leave in and what did you change\nBut that's quite that's quite difficult to explain and James ... took the lead on that one so I'm not entirely clear on a warped and okay\nAnyway thoughts the important thing is if you read it through you would not immediately think they sounds just like Hitler you know it has been changed it to insects no feminine isn't that the point of that one was really to to draw on the\nAnd the grief and it's and the totalitarian kind of feel\nOf that but also we wanted to say you wanted to prove that we could make savvy thick absolutely anything if we just both in enough different\nThey love it says that one is incredibly complicated bringing in the theory from all over the place but in the end it it it builds up to two yes it is to make that kind of we must all them together in the right thing against a common that common enemy and narratives what\nDo you have to ... when this came out uh and uh I mean I Would\nThink that this would be something that you know the uh the the the world that you travel in would be outraged that those things were accepted\nA and you would you would be viewed as a whistle blower hey wait a minute we've got a problem you done have you have you had any response like that from your peers\nSurprisingly yes we we have a good then yeah when we were delighted\nFor example that and the judge is which is often and extremely critical of criticisms of than that and his mother and a fit and sort of academic academics less does and I came down on our side\nAnd said at remained quite neutral and there's also often nine for Iran said yeah\nThe whole city on charitable\n[laughter]\nUh you know he didn't say anything with an

million other manufacturers who use steel and aluminum and what they produce I was over it and how is your Bush a couple of weeks ago they you know when they make\nA you know bud wise or they're using a lot of aluminum for those cans and they showed their prices are going up and you just that's going on around the country our auto producers are autos are more expensive because the steel tariffs so my point that Trump is this isn't even creating factory jobs were going to lose factory jobs as a result of that so\nI disagree very strongly with the steel and aluminum tariffs I think they do more harm than good\nDoes he look like he's softening now\nDo you think I don't see I don't see it either and I agree in response to that question isn't it [laughter] you know he's not you know and I I ... at\nThe rose garden last week he said how he was ... boasting about how all the steel jobs were created it's true we are creating steel jobs Mr President but we're losing jobs we're losing you know jobs in uh in other areas that manufacture a quip meant trucks and things you know those kinds of things that ...\n... it's a it's a dumb policy I Wish you would reverse it and by the way the auto ... same thing even in the U.S auto industry doesn't want the first you know there's so many of their supplies Tom from you know\nA country's abroad you know there's there was manufactured you know ... steel might have come from a you know Canada about the assembly might have come from Mexico the the parts might have come from Taiwan I mean there's just this is the modern American\nAnd global economy at work and and we put ourselves at risk here but at the end of the day I think Trump is going to prevail on China I think I'll make a production within six months I think China's gonna come out in hand and make some real concessions to to a Trump and uh and ultimately if that happens that you're going to see the biggest stock market ...\n... even more thanks so much good to talk to my

ready to fight I was ready to parched ready to stop you know the the whole like arts at that\nUh um I [noise] sorry I found out and uh my uh sorry my uh my daughter was born she was born a four months early\nAnd ah I ah my focus away from everything going on around the world to what was going on in my house by household and uh it was a sorry it was a challenging a re where\nShe was she was born member first and she was in the hospital and so on so Easter and she came home and she had a teacher and uh she was on oxygen and stuff like that but she was home\nUm I Am remarried\nAnd ah yeah my wife we have between us we had three three daughters and we try for about ten years and nothing ever happened and that are out of the blue wife calls me and says uh we'd had a conversation at a she told me that uh that she was pregnant\nAnd uh it's I don't know I I sympathize with the the the gentleman you you were talking with um\nBecause I I still have moments where I Want to get angry and stuff but then I stop and take a step back a rave at\nThis bank of like of a dollar you know\nSo did you think did you ... gain hope or did you gain perspective\n[laughter] of both I gained bulk up I just I I had hoped because I Want I Want a better world for my daughter you know uh uh\nThe the ... drum thank you for sharing that and thank you for um thanks for your honesty of emotion there um the the good thing is and that's what I tried to um impress and our caller yesterday after he hung up unfortunately was\nWe were concerned that there would be this massive blue blue wave in both the house and the Senate I think we see a red wave not a tidal wave but a red wave\nIt's possible first of all I Would say Kavanaugh if\nIf the last two years have been any indication Kavanaugh will be ancient history by the time this election happens it's like three weeks from now I like these things go away for example or the the Access Hollywood tape happened right about this time in two thousand sixteen\nRight about now with your Tobar eighth or ninth in September eleventh that I\nUh and that by the time the election came as we saw had basically no impact all time news ... I mean there's stuff goes away fast and I think\nThere will I don't think this is because because it's not just Kavanaugh if they would've yeah left it alone leclaire Williams\nBut they're not they're doubling down Hillary Clinton yesterday we can't live with these people I'm a Eric Holder comes out that the news today that he says when when they go low we kick them\nAnd the crowd cheers and this and he follows it with this is who the new Democratic Party is\nAmazing amazing Michelle Obama pushed back on that today by the way of kind of an interesting way um but you know what you see I think it if you are under control you can make these stories go away their craziness in the cabinet thing could probably be forgotten by a lot of voters if you look at it from the time that Donald Trump came down to the escalator to today\nProbably his cleanest month\nWas October two thousand sixteen\nAfter that that a tape came out\nHe was buttoned up for the rest of that time and made it very few statements and wound up winning the election um because people were able to kind of forget about you know started this craziness and scandals that were going on and look more at Hillary Clinton and Hearst craziness and scandals\nUm so if you look at that age they ... they could get it to go away doing things like we're going to kick them when they're when they go low a and a few people saying that's not a mob what are you talking about that sort of stuff is not going to help them no ... and so far since the Kavanaugh saying what we've seen is really encouraging numbers\nFor the GOP particularly in the Senate the Senate has a you know we had a lot of reasons we talked about the um Robert Francis overwork versus a Ted Cruz situation where Cruz a that poll came out of fifty two forty three\nAnd a nine point lead know Cruz had been\nThere was one poll I think that had them tied a few ... most of them settled around three or four points with cruise leading um that's expanded in multiple polls now to a nine to ten points I think it's to be more than nine or ten point yeah the pat gray who are who are not in here with us today but he was talking on his show it was yesterday the day before\nBelieves that it's going to be over ten points yeah I think it'll be I think it'll be between fourteen and Eighteen points another interesting poll that came out yesterday again from the New York times\nAnd this is the other during his life pulling thing I mentioned uh last hour\nHow many calls does it take to get seven hundred and Seventy eight responses in Texas how many calls do you have to make to get seven hundred and Seventy eight people to talk on the phone to you\nThe number fifty one thousand one hundred and Ninety two oh they had to call fifty one thousand people to get seven hundred and Seventy eight to actually participate in the poll which is kind of well you're calling Texas\nA and if it's marked with a New York number more but New York times I understand that uh I mean it\nIs but I overall like for example York they did they also polled the eastern Long Island district New York one\nAre and what they found a five hundred and two responses they had to make twenty seven thousand one hundred and Seventy eight ... are you an certain seriously you know anybody that would take the time to answer that nobody does and that I wouldn't ... again if you take into account that factor which is totally changed over the last Twenty years with cell phones and and uh telemarketers and all those things\nIt's amazing these guys get even close to accurate results from polls because your self selecting a group of people who want to participate him and it's a you know who knows if they're represented\nWhy Google Home should include some sort of an MRI so they can just read our brains and that would make it a lot he would make it a lot easier to come to your door that yeah I\nWanted to um another interesting poll that came out of there are times though however was a protest of the Taylor Swift effect remember Taylor Swift after all these are all the time being silent on on politics decided to dive into it inexplicably they\nRidiculously ... you know again like you almost feel like with her PR team if you're going to come out and do this at least have like sensible observations and there'll be just bumper sticker you know a ... you know quote tweeting Huffington Post write like\nThat wasn't the level of analysis she provided in her little post but again she's one of the biggest celebrities in the world how does this happen\nI she's from Tennessee she came out in Tennessee race the biggest thing that she talked about was Marsha Blackburn saying how anti women she was and and how she didn't care about does she wanted to keep gaze at of stores and all these ridiculous things that aren't true\nUm well the first of all come out since that um and ...\n... the most of the ... ... calls were uh after that uh fifty four to forty Blackburn leads fourteen point this was a race that within the tossup category wow now that polling holds I can think we could fit a safely\nOr understand that more people care about what Kanye West things about politics than Taylor Swift a but we'll see if that holds or not\nSo we could look at Senate possibly a red wave in\nSenate yeah I think you know so we talked about this a little while ago to which makes sense people know that where the Supreme Court is happening and also people are in red states right and they're going to become more excited to vote more passionate about voting\nThe the the house we're seeing sort of a a slight turn to the opposite effect wear purple districts um sometimes it has been a little bit lose a little more blue\nNot much to tell from it I think already the houses in real real danger I mean I it would be a surprise at this point if the Republicans were able to pull out the house not impossible it would be a surprise um uh but for the Senate real quick we had ten tossup races that we were talking about before um and I believe it was three or four that their\nI'm a but for the Senate real quick we had ten tossup races that we were talking about before um and I believe it was three or four that the ... the Republicans had to win to control the Senate I think it was three they'd with three of the tent at the time we talked about it but Ted Cruz race which in which he was favored by only three points was the best\nCase after case right now that's changed dramatically since we talked about that a couple of weeks ago now I'm a Ted Cruz seems to be on solid ground or any more than a three point lead\nA Heidi Heitkamp seems to be in massive danger I Would say it looks like two races were decided with the Kavanaugh hearings barring some other may major development ah Heidi Heitkamp voted against him she looks like she's toast and Arthur in North Dakota now a Joe mansion voted for having all he looks like he's safe\nSo those two races are not even in the ... category anymore in my mind a ... we need to really is the cruise one which gets you down to about seven toss ups\nWhich the Republicans need to win one one of the seven will keep the Senate\nIn Republican hands is much improved situation from even when it was just a couple of weeks ago the cabinet I think I think is a big part of it or we don't know that for sure yet I think it will play out in the next week or so when we really have a lot of results but it looks very promising in the Senate better than it looked to probably all year\nOr so that's a that's a good thing if you care about that\nSo they asked the let me let me explain something or this election\nCould be in that I Know I Know technically we have three branches of government but I Believe we kind of had five we have\nThe press and the people okay vibe executive legislative um and a judicial are the three in the constitution then you have the fourth which is the press and the people I Believe what\nHappens in this election could put all five branches into chaos if they win the house the house will go nuts\nAnd they will impeach they will subpoena which\nThose subpoenas we'll go to the Senate\nThe Senate will be in chaos because of it because of the Democrats\nThey will put the administrative in chaos because it will be under impeachment and it will also ah have testimony that it has to give that it will fight they're going to subpoena his tax records he will fight that which will go into the Supreme Court\nWhich the people will rise up and destabilize the fifth branch if you will the people as they stand up\nAnd they're starting to fight kind of back and forth in the streets you know not in a mob sort of way just in an ... sort of way they will the house will then again I think tried to impeach Kavanaugh\nOr at least get him to recuse himself from anything having to do with the administration you watch\nIt all in the end of the press is already in chaos all every piece of society could be in chaos based on this election\nIt's going to be a fun couple of years it'll be fun ... thanks so we don't uh give us a quick report maybe every day here as things start to change yeah ah and ah give us a look on on the polls I'd also like you to\nSummarize the polls that I gave this morning on the people\nAbout the you know what is it eight percent of the people are
