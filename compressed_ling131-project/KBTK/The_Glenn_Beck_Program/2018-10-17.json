I think you did and I've got a lot to ask you about on this but let me let me start with this\n[noise] [noise] why do you suppose that there isn't a an uprising or in Portland or they are the\nBlind to it for some reason or do they actually supported are they afraid to come out what is the what's the real readership\nIn in in Montgomery County so if I were still working on channel two I'd be doing commentary going okay I'm going to be out\nUh on the banks of the war I'm it wherever I'm going to be there at the turn in the morning on a Saturday I Want y'all come out and support what I'm doing okay nobody's going to do that there's nobody in town going to do that with any visibility it'll it'll be two\nUm unfortunately\nBecause there are many many many good people in Portland in ... county and I have friends there most people are selfish\nAlright they're into their own pursuits they're doing whatever they want to do and you know what this is it a New Orleans but I don't really want to spend time on this and then maybe there are a lot like me and maybe and teeth hit me or I'm not going to do it\nIt's a selfish thing and it's not just in Portland, Oregon I mean we have to really as as a people we really have to start to rise up and say hey you know what we want to process\nWe want a presumption of innocence we don't want dogs on the streets in mass beating people up and telling women that there has been shut rotten the grave it we don't want that\nOkay so important when do we have any democratic 'cause it's all Democrats a hundred percent got any politicians at the governor of Oregon doing anything about this saying anything about it no no no no no ... and that's how far we've come that's how far we've declined\nSo bill I Want to talk to a little bit more about this and just one thing on and when you say we've got to stand up and fight this I'd like to hear your opinion on on what exactly that means I'm but also when we come back I Want to take you to Saudi Arabia\nThat nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad okay I'm not going to seek out for Saudi Arabia is bad\nBut Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran and the middle east it's the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt it runs terrorism and destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading that charge\nSo why on earth is the American laugh wanna destroy that nation\nWhen in history we allied or so which style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you are not destroying\nSaudi Arabia you should destroy that and then not trade with them the sanction them boycott them all of that and then you turn around and go the unintended consequence of that is\nThat the whole alliance against Iran falls apart at a wine is empowered eight times as much as they are now and so the Brotherhood\nYeah and and the and the left wing press doesn't care what happened ISIS did it have you seen one article from the mainstream media about how the Trump Administration destroyed ISIS\nNo have you seen them wanting to know under Obama ISIS ran wild and killed tens of thousands of innocent people for eight years for eight years Trump gets in there and the first year he wipes them out because of math is the defense secretary and he didn't do it\nClick away it was all done behind the scenes which you can get those articles you can get those stories are even tried to get them\nAll right so bill here's here's the problem with with Saudi Arabia as I see it you're exactly right you know we're in we're in a no win situation in fact I think we're going to lose lose situation here\nStanding with people who we've known for ever dug they do this kind of thing all the time yeah ah they're bad people we shouldn't have been in bed with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the first place but we were and now they're they're I'm a strong ally that\nIs one of the only ones that is standing up for Israel at least quietly fighting the Muslim Brotherhood and fighting Iran they we have a lot of aligned interest even though I don't want to be in bed with them\nBut now how do you get out if if a get out well but wait a minute Saudi Arabia this is different because if there is a tape\nOf this guy being dismembered while he was alive this will set the world on fire it's different\nAnd any new sanctions Saudi Arabia in a way that hurts them but doesn't destroy\nThe kingdom that's what you have to do so um but look Trump does have the heart\nFor this he doesn't want to cancel the arms deals that are rich America doesn't want to do it and the reason that we're we have a relationship with Saudi Arabia anyways because they had it OPEC we needed that oil in the in the sixties and seventies and eighties\nDead on any more but now Silicon Valley takes a lot of their money\nRight so I have I say punish them\nYou know when when it comes out and I believe firmly they did it I Do I don't think there's any doubt that they did it this guy walked into the counseling and assemble Saudi council it and he was butchered or whatever okay they did it and I believe that salt and the guy running the place he ordered it\nRight to the top so when it comes out than Trump has to say we're going to do this and figure out a way to punish them\nUm but not destroy that that's what has to happen for the good of America\nAnd do you think they'll take that punishment they've said that if we run on you they have to right\nYeah yeah I mean it's just like turkey when a letting the pastor out or the guys are going to let them out while he's out\nI mean Saudi Arabia can't exist without the United states they can't exist without the United states because Iran will go in there and cause so much trouble yeah that'd be the place will collapse\nAnd so they need the United states can say whatever they want to say they need us and they've got to pay a price for this they absolutely have to pay a price for it\nDo you think turkey has the tape or is this last night I\nCan I possibly know back in the turkey or three times\nAll right uh I don't know what tape they have all what channel I watch I don't know anything\nWhat they do I I I Would think the leading national link user had interest in politics or at least have some ideas I'm a little like the gas on it I mean I Would think so too I mean it\nIn the Saudi a counseling is Saudi Arabian territory the Turks have no access they did go in by the way which is interesting and they say yeah we found some chemical agents of and then somebody\nPaint that jumping but let's just wait but I don't think anybody listening to us right now I should have any doubt\nThat this guy was just fascinated by the Saudi Government it's amazing how close to this is to rear window or the Hitchcock movie I mean it's it's really I mean it's you know if the Muslim Brotherhood and try and swords were involved um a bill always good to talk to you the book a killing the ss\nAbsolutely worth or read it applies to today shows real heroes and real real villains they got away for a way with it for quite some time\nYeah I Want to tell everybody I had

humanitarian warriors in the battle of Mosul\nYeah a welcome led to the driving back on the bed so tell me a little bit about the battle in recap where we've been together before or was this books will tell the story\nOK so last time I was on we talked about that we talked about the book and we talked about the ... fund\nUm so the book is about a a a journey I basically went on last year a humanitarian work I did in a in a in northern Iraq to help\n'em with the fight against ISIS so as a former seal it was a natural fit for me to go and um and help and now I originally thought I was just going to be doing you know the the standard humanitarian thing of handing out water bottles doing a little bit of medical aid well when I got in there um that she knows with a group called the free Burma rangers\nWe we ended up in betting with the Iraqi Army and um basically becoming their frontline medical support because they just don't have the resources to to do that themselves\nAnd so and I was not a medic how was it was a sniper and uh but I had pretty good medical training for my time is a seal and so we actually ended up being involved in the direct assault into Mosul to open up the um to open up the western front in Mosul and finally\nCollapse of the caliphate in in Mosul\nAnd we were in the city for about thirty days from from the day that we entered the city to the day that I ended up getting shot on a rescue mission I was was exactly thirty days and what happened\nIn in\nIt was something I thought I Would never see in my lifetime UC evil you see pictures of World War two you see Killing Fields you you see these black and white photos and you think I Will never see something like that you know there's a certain\nAmount of denial that you have well\nI saw it and it was real and so in the city of death I talk about my experience of going in there are sort of being caught off guard um with the amount of violence and the fighting that was happening but more

if GOP loses its\nWho cares I mean CNN [noise] can you just get over it for ten seconds is there nothing else important going on in the world\nThey're not the only ones guilty of this but there is CNN in particular a treat\nLike Donald Trump\nLike almost the reverse of ... a teenager and a boy band it's like the obsession level is is incredibly high now they're looking at it as a negative instead of a positive\nBut like they just are obsessed with this person yeah I mean it's seemingly but they're all mattered dominated by him yeah all that matters the whole thing about living rent free inside someone else's head I mean it's so on display with CNN right now they can't talk about anything else even when they're talking about other things\nSaudi Arabia Trump Saudi Arabia now Saudi Arabia and he's in trouble you know draw does Trump have ties to Saudi Arabia he's talked about his ties to Saudi Arabia\nHow they can be caught somebody up a live a lively butchered him alive caught him up and\nPut them in a suitcase and you're looking for a way an angle\nTo get Trump what is wrong with you people that's wrong with it like\nLegitimately like a sickness for some of that ... ... you know but I mean it is it as a network as a whole they can't\nFigure out a way to discuss any other topic is really incredible I mean he really doesn't dominate their lives every aspect or at least at least they're public life I don't know maybe they go home and don't talk about it I don't know but when they're on TV they're talking about it all the time it's like there's got to be something else interesting in the world there's got to be\nWell just look to the headline at Fox they're talking about Elizabeth Warren and you know are Cherokee heritage\nReally\nMy again like all of the story like dealers with Warren thing is is interesting 'cause she's gonna be running for president it's a day or two story\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas\nKept it this way try this on for size\nOr a Donald Trump is\nEverywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like Rocco Palmo was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah\nOther days you're like oh yeah that can we talk about the day and I know in talking about the ... you know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life\nTed Cruz was a very big picture or big big force in everybody's life two years ago but he's just kind of falling off the map and he's just doing a good job okay mhm I'm\nGreg Abbott is just doing a good job and nobody's talking about nobody's talking about because the state's running great everything's going really well he's a great governor he's not controversial so I think the poll numbers are just\nHow much is this person impacted my life\nIn a kind of in a bad way of oh got to deal with this again today I got to talk about this again you can get you get older you get into it but the ... yeah yeah yeah and it's not a bad thing about any of them it's just like oh I'm so tired of this ... you know it's like the closer you get to Washington gravitas here\nTed Cruz's in Washington but you know really the epicenter now and with the last president is the White House\nAnd so the closer you get the more you're like oh enough\nYeah I it's it's a it's an interesting thing I mean I it's nice to see I think you know especially if cruises hold on to this race would it seems like he will at the moment or it's going to help a lot of other candidates in really close races there six tops of races right now or Arizona Florida Indiana Missouri Montana and Nevada all of them are are very tight\nYou know the fact that the thirty eight million dollars is not flowing into a race in that group is a real positive for Republicans that the Democrats are very excited about better but I mean his chances of winning are very low\nAnd they've just thrown money at a candidate who has essentially I mean a very small chance of winning I Would say it's no chance but a very small chance of winning and you know that's only benefiting Republican chances of of keeping the Senate but they are here's what's\nHappening they've made him into a national figure ... you know they're already by putting him on Ellen y y and Z analysis\nHuh I Wonder if he doesn't get done he's he's responsible for absolutely nothing right he's not he's not something like up and coming outsider right like he's a guy who's been in Congress for a long time or he has been in politics for very long time\nHe's the whole life has basically been politics outside of his early ... I Swear it's just because they think he's good looking guy and he can he can get a good speech\nI think he's I think it's it's the bronco bomb a syndrome of two thousand for what is this guy done he will he gave a good speech\nBefore well you should be president what is this guy done well he's been on Allen\nI mean it's it's it's not just that he's good looking I think that there is a part of the Democratic party that does not want to go the Democratic socialism anti capitalist sort of way and Beto doesn't look like\nThat you don't like his ... his power as I Am as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez correct I mean they went ... went through them and the debate yes last night\nI'm sure some of these young yet but first of all let's start with a hit a Beddoes opening and how you may know\nBeto is a a Hispanic\nNo ... no Hispanic votes name is Robert actually Brandt says here from a Central America I Know a very recently Irish and he uh and he came out and make sure you knew how Hispanic he was the last Hispanic than war than Elizabeth Warren is charity I don't know what you're talking about here's a here's the battles open\nFirst case let me thank you and Sarah from moderating tonight's debate Ken's five for hosting us the people of San Antonio for being here and the people in Texas for watching this and participating in one most important decisions of our lifetimes ... author of as a ... I'm In San Antonio\nYes the powerful see how it's panic he is he can't even stop himself from speaking Spanish ... he was trying to speak in English that entire time and just slipped into it because it's so natural for him coming from his deep Hispanic roots and that's something I Want you to make sure you understand unlike the old white guy\nOr she may not prove knows it on white or who is ... I mean\nIt's so ridiculous Ted Cruz's old white guy with a ... a year and a half to two years older than a ...\n... or Robert Francis Oregon or he's not my will come ... um anyway so uh this is it was interesting to watch just because you know like as you pointed out crews runs for president he doesn't win or anything\nYou know you don't hear from him as often as you did and but he's been doing a great journeys his voting record is very solid I think you know anybody whether you like Trump branded like going to like the stuff he he votes for\nThe stuff he's doing behind the scenes with the judiciary and I don't mean just the Supreme\nCourt I mean the ah the ah the federal courts is remarkable and we'll change the course of court decisions for very long\nTime yeah he's been very involved the very involved um however Beto I don't I don't know I mean I get the idea that maybe he's a younger and good looking and can speak coherently I think that's the only thing he can is attractive to a lot of neck muscles\nYeah a lotta neck muscles a very shiny and well very China but he um talked about\nAbout Cruz and his motivations remember this is a guy who's brought in the only story about better off of any note if he's raised a lot of money that is his entire the entire region anyone who's ever discussed him because he has raised a fortune but of course he goes after Cruz over money listen\nSpeaking of balancing budgets I'm only one of us has with\nGood friends in El Paso started a small business ... met that payroll every week balance the books made sure that we deliver for our clients only one of us has served at the local government level every single year balancing the budget seeing each other not as Republicans and Democrats but at the council members entrusted\nWith a share of responsibility to deliver for the taxpayers will pass every single year we did and for Senator Cruz to say that this isn't going to bust the budget at a time of Twenty one trillion dollars in debt when we're on track the deficit spend to the tune of a trillion dollars a year he voted at two\nTrillion dollars and those tax cuts just proportionately will flow to corporations who are already sitting on record piles of cash\nFor any already wealthy in a country that has ribbons with income inequality unseen simple last gilded age why\nIn the days just before and just after that vote Sen Cruz except that one hundred and twenty thousand dollars from the political action committees who represent the corporate interests that benefited from this sucks 'cause that's why does the vote for this why does he vote for Internet companies to sell your private browsing data to the highest bidder without ...\nWhy does he not vote for universal background checks in a country that loses thirty thousand people to gun violence every year follow the money in each of these cases if you look at the political action committee contributions to Senator Cruz it helps to explain the reasons for his vote and how corrupt Congress has become\nNow again unbelievable hundred and twenty thousand dollars really if Ted Cruz changing and opinion over a hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nIt's ridiculous if cruise dropped out of the Senate right now he get a lobbying job at some from and make millions without even thinking about it he was ... I mean he's highly educated his wife worked at Goldman Sachs if we remember this is not a not a money\nIssue or for crews are beyond that\nOf course Beto O'Rourke\nHas accepted or as had many ads run on his behalf ... from ... from PACs and superPACs and he's got that\nLittle uh you know that little line of ... you know I'm not telling them to do it so therefore I'm not responsible more in but again he's raised thirty eight million dollars he's complaining about one hundred and twenty thousand dollar\nDonation to cruise it make some changes opinion worth thirty eight million dollars do what does that make you\nI'll tell you what it does I think thirty eight million dollars uh for some uh makes you in to a national candidate for another race not this one ... for others who have given part of that thirty eight million dollars\nOr in large a chunks that just piss them off because I Want results are results I gave you told me that this guy had a chance this guy was gonna do it I saw him everywhere and you still got beat and\nA and a beaten by how much wasn't\nEven close where's my money where's my money\nI you know I think that's how people who would react to that but\nI I Know people on the Democratic side who have given money who are absolutely that they have given given and given and they're like you know I have to tell you\nYou're you're off the deep end with crazy

yesterday and I missed it I didn't I didn't catch this until after the program yesterday little Bryan's daughter\n\nThe CNN media critic\nWas on CNN yesterday complaining\nThat Trump is in the media too much that Trump is talking too much that Trump won't shut up he is doing great damage to the country he's damaging the media because he used to bail them all you ever heard of them\nDrive by is worrying about too much access well actually you know what they don't have that well\nLook I'm forty eight and one in the primaries actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful\nThat people don't even talk about but many of those for the aid is you know where people that have no chance in some cases we look at Florida you look at Donovan in Staten Island he was losing by ten points I endorsed him he won I can give you a long list of names look at Georgia governor\nMany many racist and I will say that we have a very big impact I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact because I'm having they would say that in the old days and if it got the support of a president or if you got the support of somebody it would be nice to have but it meant nothing zero like literally zero\nWell some of the people I've endorsed have gone up forty and fifty points just on the endorsement in no way in that statement does Donald Trump say\n\nHe doesn't even addressed the house being lost he doesn't even accept that premise a pie offers it\nAs a premise so they say if Republicans lose control the house with a ... do you believe you better responses but no\nI think I'm helping people that becomes a headline Trump tells a pie he won't\nAccept blame of GOP loses house now the eight people tell you what oh that's essentially what he was saying no it isn't essentially you are miss quoting Donald Trump does not looking at himself as a negative at all he's not looking forward and seeing the need for excuses any pay\nHe thinks he's helping people he thinks he is helping secure victory but it's not even in his mind that they're going to lose and somebody's going to blame him\nThis is why Trump never\nMisses an opportunity to talk

isn't covered properly and it's not that the economy's not covered properly by these so called mainstream media and it isn't a we went up almost six hundred once yesterday and they didn't even have it on the major news you couldn't find it anywhere in\nThe economy is doing probably better than it's ever done in history and they don't even talk about it and that's because they have their opinion and they'd like to keep their opinion going the way they haven't they do not treat us fairly and therefore if I Do the news they owe me on the news so I can talk a lot of myself\nAnd what about the your tweets and so for these people say we don't want any more tweets anybody ever tried to tell you stopped waiting\nOh and I don't think I'd be talking to you if I did that I said way of getting out the message look we're fake news everyone's sake and I'm not saying you and some of the people on Fox and I know of\nThey will create this cloud of suspicion this\nCloud of danger\n\nThat port handles disaster for Trump they'll referenced this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms when\nMullet releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of this\nIs going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waving to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end this\nBecause his report goes to Rosenstein who is technically is boss the department of justice and to Congress and there is decided whether or not that\nIt is made public so if the Democrats do when the house they're going to insist that Muller not conclude\nThey investigate particularly if he hasn't found any collusion of the Democrats win the house they're going to tell them what we got\nTime man we can all the time in the world keep getting\nWe don't need to report right now we rent any one house and we didn't mean your report so you keep digging\nHint hint you keep dig until you find that proof\n... meaning since we're on the show\nYou're not going to need any proof all you need to do is highly speculate that have happened we'll take care of the rest that's going to be the Democratic message if they win the house\nIf the Republicans when the house\nWhile there's a whole new ballgame in terms of what mother will do and how he will do it and whether he will and that wrap it up issue as report or not but there is no reason\nOther than political\nReasons there's no reason for smaller to say or for anybody to leak\nThat he's ready to deliver key findings no reason to do that\nOther than to have been used as a change agent\nIn the upcoming mid terms\nSpecifically Muller is close around during judgment on to the most explosive aspects of his inquiry\nWhether they're very clear incidence of commotion between Russia and from [laughter] believe me that one of the lead long ago there isn't any of that and the second thing is whether the president took any action as it comes to the obstruction of justice\n\nAnd Bloomberg goes on to say some things that make it look like they're pretending that there's even more being investigated besides collusion an obstruction but there isn't then they say there's the question of timing is critical monitors work won't be concluded ahead of the midterm elections when Democrats hope to take control the house\nAnd and Trump's one party hold on watching it but this time line raises questions about the future of the pro it sells Trump single he may replace Jeff Sessions after the election a move that could bring in a new boss for smaller Rosenstein my also resigned re filed by Trump after the election but you notice here\nMueller's work won't be included a head on November six mid term elections when Democrats hope to take control that normally every news story is written from the perspective of its impact on the Democrats\n\nOther words what what does work won't be concluded ahead of the November six mid term elections when Republicans corn maintain control about no one ever think of writing that\nThis is out there to create the\nIllusion that Mueller has been gardens and it's only a matter of time before the world is officially told at Trump loaded that's what they hope to create witness and the media will be helping and it will all the impact votes\nAnd again\nIf there was done to be this gigantic blue wave that was not in doubt why would any of us would be necessary let me take a break what's what's next in the ...
