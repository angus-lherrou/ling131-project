some words no\nDoubt that\nBecause you're not even willing to let them know [noise]\nRemember when I said there was more than that momentous than I had realized there's Denise defending and I'm like saying you can't\nDo that to her head that after what happened in that moment I asked Denise later\nI just felt very angry that from one that was supposed to be sharing my point of view in my perspective was blatantly disrespectful on completely shut off in one of the main thing that I honestly just like to defend her\nWhether she was on my side they're sided matter\nIn that moment to moment of impact the enemy line to actually shifted someone on the complete opposite end of the issue became an ally to Denise when there was a greater obstacle to overcome [noise]\nWant greater

obstacles to consensus so many of the times was the same person risk\nNow are you willing to put ... into the [noise] it wasn't his ideas the majority of the room shared his idea of them will pretty much everything it was his approach\nThe conversation\nHe became the greater optical\nMany times we would all agree to an idea but and going around the room for consensus we should the blonde hair for everyone around [noise]\nBut the problem is I came here I Am an hour to anticipating his block to a new idea a rule I think he knew he was playing\nAbout that before [laughter] you know we're three here I Am again and Matthew specifically because you're the you're in your mind and it is right now and then this happened\nNow are you willing to put some words no\nIt wasn't the content of what he was saying it was the way she was saying the intention behind it and that was because of his number\nThe number ... walking\nAids for six three ten ten or ...\nWhat [noise] remember those numbers and the sound guy was setting up and people who are sitting down and sipping their water nervously I Wonder how could only measure the degree of hope that they were bringing to this round table how can I gauge their commitments to finding my list to just an audio started recording you hear me asked\nThem how do you think is likely one to ten on finding some sort of some sort of you know jump on [noise] what do you honestly believe in them and then to too many\nNumbers were privately pass to me at the beginning of the conversation and never referred to again until it was time to leave three hours and forty six minutes later he was the actual moment to the conversation ended and the numbers are revealed you'll hear Rick at the end\nStuff it's a tough one\nCan't wait to see more our numbers come out\nUh it was\nThink three\nTen ... or ... what was already\nKnow there was a race or one of the interesting\nRick was the one\nWe never had a chance [noise]\nIn fact the next day he sent me an email saying quote real I think this was in college but the impact is far too wide and kept him to be quote\nAnd quote\nA one will always diminished the hope in any given them just the way that negativity lately overwhelms whatever true hope\nThere is out there we've all been Rick for whatever reason or whatever mood we've all been that person [noise] but a one is a very powerful thing especially in a very divided America [noise]\nSo to me the answer for how do we move forward and work together to keep our children safer [noise]\nUsed to be any number\nGreater than one\nThis is Denise at the end of all round table\nDenise who went on to open up her world to show a fellow American than she is an aide them\nDenise is number is eight\nI'm loving sitting here like my heart is

United states just started hearing audio soundbites ... he is apologizing Kavanaugh on behalf of the nation\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who stepped forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified\nEvaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nJust calling them out this covers right this is not done what normally when you get to the ceremonial swearing in you follow the script and all of that is in the past it's not to be referenced again the fight is over\nEverybody acknowledges that the result is the result we're moving forward except that's not the way it is anymore the Democrats are not stopping the fights not over to them\nThe Democrats are openly promising to impeach Kevin other openly promising that continue investigate Kevin on\nThey are openly talking about packing the court if they win the house of representatives to nullify the power capital has as the fifth so call conservative justice on the court they're not pulling back at all this is one of the world over\nAnd so Trump is calling them out and I told you folks this is crucial we don't I Can't think of any former president would ever do anything like this in defense of his nominee\nIn defense of his principles I Can't think of one who would do it and it's just as important but Trump do this and it was important when Trump at a rally\nExplained to the American people what the American media has not told them\nWhen he resigned the essence of her testimony\nThat when the drive by that that he was mocking Dr malls before he wasn't mocking he was simply in warming the American people what the media was holding from them that she couldn't tell anybody where it happened she couldn't tell them when it happened she wasn't sure where the house was\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required if you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do\nIf you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says buddies believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nThen that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court\nThe rest of it the history onyx the child like

... facto career and life political murder\n\nTo stop things they don't want to stop\nPeople that they don't want how do you how do you oppose\nThem how to beat that back\nTo do it with decency to do it with politeness do you do it with manners I'm Sorry I'm\nGoing to cut it sorry never Trump or his bought the right manners and ... and so forth isn't going to cut it some people might say Russia the ... the church is rock solid the churches where in during the ... uh not anymore\nThe churches are like every other institutions sucking up the people they hold power everybody needs money churches need money all kinds of people need money and if the people are going to give you money demand that you be a certain way and be open to certain things and you're going to do it this is half a take a look at your papa\nAnd what's even happening to the Catholic Church in places serious serious problem when talking about the preservation of what I call our way of\nLife underneath the umbrella of decency\nSo we're very lucky we have somebody willing to push back against the from the highest\n\nLevels of power in the country Donald Trump fear loosely pushes back on it are caused amount identifies\nThem they're not used to this they don't know how to react to it media is the greatest illustration of that not knowing how to react to being called out for what you really are I\nMean everybody's accused the media being biased over the years but nobody accuses them of fake making it up\nParticipating in the open and want to ruin nation of people nobody ever accuses them of that and I'm not I mean we may hear but its highest levels that governs never happened before there's Donald Trump doing it and from the East Room of the White House here is more Trump last night\nThis really triggered him when he declared Kavanaugh innocent\nWhat happened to the cabinet or a family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty [noise]\nAnd\nWith that I must say that use are under historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank\nYou saw [laughter]\nRight [laughter] [noise]\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness encourage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens\nYou know what that is I'm Sorry never traumas but that's just pure class to take\nTo look at those two little girls and tell them that their father is a great man in the midst of all of this\nTime out to tell those two young daughters\nOf breath and actually Kavanaugh your father is a great man every father wants to hear that every father loves having his children told that he was a great man few ever are afforded that\nOpportunity but Trump did it last night then\nProclaiming Kavanaugh's innocence I mean that is I can to taking all the poison the arrows at every Democrat launched it Kevin all the past two weeks and firing them back at once right down the throats of every Democrat Senator on the Judiciary Committee and every member of the media tried to ruin the capital\nTo openly proclaiming him innocent\n\nHe can't do that that was in a corner law he doesn't know but they had him guilty didn't say he was guilty simply on the basis of the allegation\n\nI Want to say one more time I don't believe anything that we went through the past two weeks starting with the realization that Christine Blasey Ford and written a letter to Dianne Feinstein I don't think any of it was spontaneous\nAnd I don't think any of it was happenstance I think every bit of it was an orchestrated campaign just like every other October surprise in politics is\nI think the Democrats were in on it I don't know whether ... forge privacy was violated I don't know if she was in on it or if she was also a storage\n\nBut somebody suggested she writes that letter Monica McLean her buddy who has FBI connections to Preet Bharara who hates Trump the yesterday and why the United states attorney as well as all these FBI people trying to prove Trump Russia collusion\n\nI don't think they ever expected it to get as far as it did they thought Trump would pull back withdraw the nomination or the Kavanaugh would pull out and they would never get as far as ... as it got very was\nClearly\nIllustrated she had no evidence low cooperation no nothing in their strategizing of this event they never thought I'd go that far\nOne of the reasons is there used to Republican presidents caving nominee gets in big trouble pull the nomination presidents don't want the grief starts reflect\nPoorly on them as they go to the nomination look [noise]\nIt won't work nominate we can't sustain this you gotta ... nominees inside damn it's my one sorry nominee up pulling my support nominee\nPresident get together for the good of the country blah blah blah blah nominee pulls out didn't happen here Trump repeal is to pull out withdraw ghetto capital that's
