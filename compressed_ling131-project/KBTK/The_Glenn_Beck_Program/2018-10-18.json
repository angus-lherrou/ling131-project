really seemed to be a high priority\nOf NATO founders yeah to make sure that people weren't accused of crimes and punishment for them with no evidence or and or no way to give someone due process due process seemingly important to the founding of this country seemingly\nBut it's no longer important because how good just the accusations enough to I guess ruined you I mean Kobe Bryant went on to have a really good career and he I don't know just a few years after he was accused maybe even the next year he signed a hundred and thirty six million dollar deal so his life was okay\nUm however when it's affecting them now Fifteen Years later and it's already been\nWorked out in whatever way or the Nineteen year old to group refused to testify against him or they dropped the charges that used to mean okay he wasn't guilty but now it just means I'm your tainted for life if you've ever been accused of anything\nYeah I don't know I don't know if it's like this constant barrage we've had for the past few decades of CSI and law and order but every institution that's supposed to be investigators\nThey're all supposed to be able to solve crimes that the police can't solve their all supposed to know more information and yeah this happens in the NFL the time and the NBA it's like there's a crime committed and there's an accusation and they'll just released the player yeah like well wait a minute don't they get a chance right\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's trying to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated a reception\nOf Michael everybody which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy the I guess they are so pissed off about that and they do not want I'm running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are today are very much trying to destroy him at this point\nBut what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then my club and out of yeah introduce himself to you\nBut it's so bad that even Trevor Noah who's the ... I mean I I thought John Stewart was on funny this guy is on funny too about the one million to power but\nI'm Trevor Noah on Comedy Central the other day I took on Hillary Clinton and you know to his credit actually said some some accurate things are about her and and whether or not she's the best person to be speaking out on sexual allegations here's what he said\nIn retrospect do you think\nBill should've resigned in a way because the Monica Lewinsky scandal currently not it wasn't an abuse of power now\nNow there are people who look at the incidents in the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with and in turn the power imbalance as to why in and out but let me ask you know where's the investigation of the current income than ...\n[noise] I'm Sorry man look here's the thing that's not cool maybe it was different in the nineties\nBut today I think we're all understanding that there's a massive power imbalance between an intern and the presidents of the United states right I mean forget in trying to present with anyone as a power imbalance person Obama texted me I have proper you up a [noise]\nI'd have to let him slash and then he'd be like I actually I just want to know if you're watching the game and I'll be like oh yeah I knew that I knew that of course I did yeah [noise] and also of course Henry fines and deflect and make this about Trump like you're not in a position to be throwing stones at someone Henry especially when you literally sitting in a glass house\nUm other than the power dynamic thing while he is saying there is is really amazing because nobody takes around like that on the left um but I don't buy into the power dynamics that nobody can say ... or no\nTo the president of the United states of course you could I mean don't you wouldn't you certainly tried to raise your children to grow up to the people that would say no to president in states yes absolutely yeah you don't you don't let him do whatever he wants to because you're the he's the president and and this is a side thing may may be a longer\nBut Monica Lewinsky is not a meat to victim she is not ready to get it she was a willing participant in an old fashioned affair is what she was\nAnd could have said no could have said no she absolutely should have said no he obviously should have said no and and from his perspective you know he's the price of the United states he\nIs doing things that he should not be be doing but like it's totally different than Juanita Broderick or Paula Jones that these are totally different stories she was a ... she was in love with the guy\nShe told a literary trip she was in love with him\nWe're Paula Jones that these are totally different stories she was a ... she was in love with the guy she told a literary trip she was in love with him like she thought that they are eventually we're going to be together and be married\nAnd this was not a situation in which she was like oh wow I'm I'm I'm scared for my career for example like that's the thing though that was a power imbalance well\nThere's an implication even if the person doesn't do it\nThere's an implication that maybe they'll ruin your career if you don't hook up with them or which first of all is prosecuting a crime before it occurs like you get your just assuming the person's going to commit a crime and ruin your career over sexual stuff but that's a whole different story that's not what happened here\nShe was she was a willing participant in an affair she was she was into it and she was also by the way ... and the one pointed ballot for Hillary there she was an adult we\nWe should not be excusing all action by twenty three year old with it right or twenty three year old men you were an

himself like pain of the murder and the other Merck rebelled and there was\nA war among the murder because no one should do and that your message when I was a kid stuck with\nIf you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedians I never heard of they're probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks in it doesn't set or Jerry Seinfeld comes into all things that are loose the gay woman doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he's bounced around to several clubs around New York since and they let them under the age so the New York times of exhaustive report about trying to talk to the club owner but why you let him on stage\nThis is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision\nBut some other people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy but he's a comedian and like okay when do you think he could come work now he's like\nNever ... might never he says never\nWell could you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence never work again he says I don't care never this is an admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as the harvest place what you would say\nParticularly to a female customer who is somebody else on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton who was credibly obviously accuse in Juanita broader I mean I think\nNobody will expect a warning before he shows up somewhere\n... nobody\nLike why were they sharing Roman Polanski as they were the years why were they giving standing ovation ... director accused of sexually abusing he ... he did it but behind all these people you're mentioning Roman Polanski the film director Bill Clinton the president Lewis became a comedian\nIs someone who gives them a stage and in this case that's you know but I'm had nobody cares that Mike Tyson who rapes are convicted of raping somebody performs looking only control the venue you control yet but but it's not unusual to\nExpect some consistent wow and you see wildly inconsistent demand if it's so obvious that the guy who Nasser ... in front of\nWomen and expose himself and women should never work again\nYeah I I he's I mean that's amazing meet your rationale of\nOkay but you let this guy on who did much less than they are and you shouldn't you shouldn't have let this comedian perform on your stage fright and the fact that nobody cares about these other people the same people right by the way\nWho want him to shut out Louis C K didn't care about Clinton didn't care about any of these other circumstances but he's\nSupposed to yeah and it you know I I Will say he he was really smart about this I mean he he well he some great points in this interview and and the New York times reporter was constantly trying to say well yeah but you did this thing and you allowed and try out it personally on him as to why he made the decision which is an interesting part of the story but I mean he made the point is\nWell of look what is the line\nWe don't allow him a Louis ... to work so what does that mean does he go on the governmental or can you work at other jobs can work what if Louis the cake hired by Walmart\nWould that be okay\nI I think it's it's a fascinating I ever support himself in life yeah again and the idea that this guy had not been punished for the English sanity yeah the Manhattan was making ten million dollars a\nYear and he's probably now making a movie making at a comedy cellar appearance fifty dollars maybe five hundred dollars I don't know nothing may I wouldn't be surprised if he just walks in and does it because he wants to do it\nOr he has you know paid for this and in a large way\nUm and you know it it certainly affected his career and a big waste most movies he's lost jobs\nBut I mean we saw this with Charlottesville there was a guy who can again we're talking about a consensual act 'cause if I can yeah I can central time he actually did it yeah\nIt was it was interesting you will and will there was one case in which as we discussed the well known them no\nAnother case on the phone where we don't know what happened another case where he started doing it and the woman left because she didn't want any part of it will be good for her or him that's what you should she should walk out rank he's a loser and tell every all of her friends that he's a loser for a um but that does that mean that he should be losing jobs ten or Fifteen Years later\n... another great example of this book\nWe saw the people we play the video and the and the audio of a you know Jews will not replace us and and all these crazy chance from the real dirt bags or in in Charlottesville carrying torches and ... you know the the deepest darkest corners of the ... right and ... one of the guys\nWho attended a rally and was in some of those videos\nOr was identified as a man who worked at a hot dog stand in California\nHe was fired from his job at the hot dog stand now how is this a good outcome for anyone that look if he is saying to black customers I won't serve you because you're black\nObviously we get that but if they're into indication that I'm In the kitchen if that ever happened he did his job at the seemingly right for everyone he was serving hotdogs and making hotdogs and it was not like you know he was not at high levels of finance here [laughter] and so now we we we can all feel\nGood about ourselves the dynamic of a hotdog vendor though is that a still intimidated or other people that's true so so I guess that we can all feel good about ourselves\nBut the fact that we are instead of him having a job at a hot dog stand instead we will support him with our tax dollars\nBecause he's going to be at home and all these projects and programs that liberals have created over the years to support people in need are going to go to this white supremacist who can no longer hold down his job at a hotdog stance crazy 'cause we're too morally above him\nI crazy I don't want to ever hang out with a guy who would go to that rally and carry a torch and say Jews will not replace us never but I mean do do what we do is we just find every one of these guys\nWould go to that rally and carry a torch and say Jews will not replace us never but I mean do you do what we do is we just find every one of these guy you wanted you to replace you [laughter]\nOf course they never consider you want to I Would rather not\nBy anyone [laughter]\nI never have considered that include uh gee I guess I guess I don't like me\nOr anyone else does include that\nUp but I guess [laughter] I really don't want anyone um it's just a it's a weird thing we're dealing with because\nYou know finding someone a in a video and identifying them on line gives you the sort of rush of I've out at this terrible person and I can punish him who really punishing I mean I ... for certainly you're pushing the taxpayers the area who now have to support the loser\nWho actually somehow was able to hold down a job selling hot dogs and now has to fit inside probably playing X. box well you're paying him to do it I mean you want to win but don't celebrate that one I I I don't know it's a strange direction for us to be going\nAnd it's an ... ... yes yes it's not it's absolutely crazy\nOr so maybe the answer is um they just can't be alive anymore I mean is it almost comes down to that because if they can't support themselves\nAnd certainly the state you don't want them supported by your tax dollars right so I guess all people who are accused just starve to death now yeah I I guess that's what it comes\nTo get it that's the way it works and I I Would be nice for us to find some consistency in this world would you know the fact that like you know if you were to say the me too movement I bet to most people\nAre sure you get hurt you get Harvey Weinstein mentioned mhm um and you might get ... maybe Kevin Spacey or one of the other two you know few few big stars but what you would almost definitely get is Donald Trump\nRoy Moore and Brett Kavanaugh and every conservative are anyone even supposedly leaning right that you can think of that was accused\nThose have all had huge play in the media the I mean what's the percentage Ninety five percent have been on the left ... it's all Hollywood and news media people and I mean it's been almost everyone has been in those industries and those industries obviously lead incredibly to the left\nThe idea that this is a right wing phenomenon I mean it just seems like people who are on the right pay the price for it where people on the left you know don't necessarily see that the same way and you know I think you have to get to a point where\nSomeone like Lucy K who was I think ... accused ... correctly of being a dirt bag right to his ... to his own admission but\nNot not any nothing that was over this line of sexual assault at least is not as reported you know you have to look at these\nThings as they say it I mean is even sorry no doing shows again um and he was a he was accused of something or you know what's his face from the New York times he's back\nOr or Glenn or what the heck is his name you know we get wrong frustrate you used a of a of a harassing you're young interns and other underlings and he he's back at work\nWe have this weird saying why I mean Mike Tyson\nIs pretty clear the man was convicted of rape not not time convicted of rape spent time in prison yeah and he's like the darling of the media he comes out of you guys the silly appearances everywhere have a problem going anywhere now doing anything and he's I mean look he served time he's out right now\nUm and so you can make the case as the left has beat forever that people who go in felons should be able to come back and vote you should be their programs that give felons in convicted felons and murderers jobs\nYet but when someone's accused of something much less than murder they can never work again and not even convicted just accused ... yeah it really doesn't make any sense to relate seven twenty seven back is the phone number or it is a pat and sue for Glenn who\nTo those sending me messages saying hey she has a right to do this before she has a right to do this but shame

that's ridiculous it is it's got a bad\nYou know there is also a for you to I was thinking of you well as I was reading this new study on the burger chains are having failing grades with their antibiotic use in their ...\nOh I Know I I Know I'm not sure one eighty five burger James reveal a very different pattern now there's a new study the chain reaction burger edition and if he thought it

mean you wanna talk about all full environmental organization [laughter]\nThose are the top of the list\nBut the use of antibiotics in the beef industry is a terrible terrible it's fairly terrible right so there's ... there's only two restaurants that uh you know fast food chains that got the essays are in their belief that they don't use any beef with antibiotics burger phi\nWhich I've never been to never heard of that and shakes jak oh really ... right I Know I Am at all that yeah I Want a guy let's check let's go to shrug show right now runs the U.S [laughter] leave right now you know

it's making us resistant to change the way our core a left wing environmental groups are saying there's bad things in their right a watch I that means absolutely nothing to me\nI'm guessing there's worse things than antibiotics and they're not like you know cow poop and that kind of mixed in there that are on 'cause some of this stuff is not\nDone really well yeah did you see this report in la

that's included in this terrible thing and and you go through the course\nOf course at the end of the day there's absolutely nothing to the report because that is what you know medical journalism has come to it especially about food [noise] they just try to say like well this ingredient is included in some other thing that sounds scary\nUm of course you don't eat nearly enough to come close to any problematic area where you are constantly you know we can't miss some of us why\nThey shouldn't say that would definitely never been to the point of us need to be concerned [laughter] if you're eating as much as nine horses would eat well okay I can ... falls into that category so but it's\nJust we get so scared about these things in in Ninety nine percent of it is nothing like it you go and you can have all the things that they say you could never touch you can have as long as you don't go crazy with them as long as you're not constantly eating them all the time you're going to be okay and honestly most of the stuff even if you are eating it\nThe time you're ... you're probably going to be okay I mean we are but I'm pretty resilient creatures here I don't even tell this from a guy who's who's in the past\nYeah all the time you're ... you're probably going to be okay I mean we're pretty resilient creatures here I don't even tell this from a guy who's who's in the past drank round up
