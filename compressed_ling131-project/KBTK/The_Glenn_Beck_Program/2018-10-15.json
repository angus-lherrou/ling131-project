[noise]\n[noise]\nMonday October Fifteen you're listening to the Glenn Beck program\nAcademic grievance studies and the corruption of scholarship\nPart was the introduction something has gone wrong in the university especially in certain fields within the humanities\nScholarship base less upon finding truth and more upon attending to social grievances has become firmly established if not fully dominant within these fields and there are scholars increasingly but bully students administrators and other departments into adhering to their world view\nSo Dr James Lindsey a along with a couple of other friends decided you know I let's find out what this is all about let's see what the lines are and they learned an awful lot ah they learn something\nA quite valuable that you just can't get away with anything you have to fall into a a set pattern really Dr\nJames Lindsey a is joining us now he is a thinker he's not a philosopher but he has a thinker which I like a doctorate in math or background or in physics uh James how are you sir\nGood Glenn how are you\nA good um so tell us what you were tell us what you were trying to do what were you trying to prove\nWell we were looking into these fields to find out whether or not their scholarship has gotten so kind of ideological bias that if we put forth I'm\nReally absurd arguments or that they might be willing to publish though so long as they've felt fell in line with the political views that they seem to be forwarding and plays a scholarship\nSo ... that first you didn't you didn't really understand the political view part right because the first few the studies that you use submitted\nA you've got back they were rejected\nYeah um well it's not quite that actually we I think we understood the political view but we didn't understand the need for a scholarship we started this project out and as you said we got the first several papers\nAre back rejected we started in August by Thanksgiving when it literally Thanksgiving a day of are we really realized we were in trouble um we weren't getting anywhere with trying to hook them but the problem wasn't we didn't understand the politics so much although there's still a lot to learn there and there was for us to a very complicated\nThey call it a matrix of domination that you have to understand\nUm but it was more that we actually we're not trying to work their scholarship and so there are two things that are needed\nTo to get these papers and one is that you actually have to understand what they call scholarship you have to do it according to their rules you you have to understand the concept you're working with and present them knowledgeably and then\nAnd sit on my defense sanctuary cities that stop liberal police from working with

business let us keep it looking great for you\n\nMore stimulating talk Glenn Beck Ninety seven point one of the doctor\n\nClint Van [noise]\nThese now published studies are a just a tremendous uh I mean I don't know how if you guys had beers before you came up with this or how you guys came up with these are but they're fantastic oh let's go through some of them one by one let's start with the first one dog\nPark the or the thesis is dog parks are re rape condoning spaces tell me about\n... tell me about it\nWell it's kind of funny actually I'm I'll tell ya story um when I went to we we all got together to to have this ... public as best we could so I went to Portland we all went to Portland, Oregon\nToo I'm ready for this project to come out publicly went to the dog park on the first day I got there almost right off the plane I took over next thing you know I'm walking\nCaters dog the dog park with our filmmaker and uh we get to the dog park and there's this just dogs they're living out the paper it was crazy this dog\nWas fighting the other dog's hunting them down hunting them left right and center the the owner comes over by the same as the ball thrower at the dog gently I'll point out he wasn't being abusive and then the stop hunting\nAnd then we get to as I lean over to the filmmaker and kind of monitor I guess a little too loudly but maybe we should start interrogating people about their sexuality given much is going down here and then this lady yells out to me oh no no it's okay she's the girl dog and I was like oh man this papers happening for real\n[laughter]\nSo what is what is the thesis\nSo the thesis for all the original idea behind the thesis was that we should write a feminist paper arguing that we should train ... and the way that we train dogs to prevent rape culture\nAnd so I thought that if they thought it was pretty funny when I was brainstorming ideas for papers to Peter Peter takes his dog the dog park every day I'm like I said let's work and some of the stuff from the dog park and as we started working and just you know absolutely absurd ideas from\nWhat might be considered the most ridiculous dog park in the world or the paper grew into that and so we made it about\nSo called queer perform activity and human reactions at the park and then ended up including things like that we we should be able to leash man released dogs ... to prevent rape except if not politically feasible\nAnd uh gosh\nIt would be great if we could\nPut shot colors on men but that's not okay either so we have to shock them out of you know hitting on women by screaming at them to scare them and get them from their behavior the thesis of the paper was though that humans\nReacted differently to gay dog hunting as opposed to stray dog hunting and\nMen were far worse about this than women and then we concluded that this is indicative of race culture and we called the dog park rape condoning\nAce loosely than whites to nightclubs with a great night clubs are also rape condoning spaces was no evidence for that whatsoever\n\nSo that was pretty out there um that one was was really out there I think it's I don't know maybe the one about the the feminist spiritual spirituality meetings and poetry it's a little more out there but it's probably close to the most\nWell LOU LOU finished the dog park this one was accepted and reviewed uh some of the reviews is a wonderful paper incredibly innovative rich and analysis extremely well written in organized\nA yadda yadda I Believe this ah intellectually and imperial being periodically exciting paper must be published and congratulated the author on the research done and\nIn the writer a and in the right yeah yeah\nThat was that low to the most disturbing parts of this I feel like because the ... again it wasn't like these ... these journals looked at this and didn't really go through it and kind of just ... it made its way through the process there are very specific comments from dozens\nOf reviewers who are on the ... who are doing peer review in saying specific things that you wrote that are completely ridiculous are amazing\nI was missing the field I mean that had to be wild funny and it proved your point had to be really disturbing as well\nOh yeah that's by far what we consider to be the most important evidence that we gathered in the process of of this project that the papers it got published or that they are award in some cases are one case and all of this it's fine I says a lot in a disturbing but the reviewers comments show that the\n... bureau viewers which it worked out between two and four or five or paper so we ended up with something like forty five or fifty total a set of comments\nThey they really did engage with what we did they really looked at it they said our analysis was good ones are analysis was terrible they didn't raise an eyebrow about the data we gather the idea that um you know the dog park paper contains\nA bit of a completely irrelevant evidence about where dogs go to the bathroom and unauthorized ways as we've ordered it and that's completely irrelevant to the paper but nobody raised an eyebrow about how ridiculous that is um they were concerned however that we\nIndicate that we're human about dogs so that we can be sure that we don't claim that when a dog there was a ... ... thing of another dog whether or not the dogs they got ... wanted her or not because\nHow could we know that as being ... and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little\nVideo we put out to announce the project they're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals um\n[laughter] and going out and so what what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... what I mean you got me man but [laughter] I thought it was done in the privacy of a of a veterinary office okay\nUm let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nAre the the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building is a category in which that is displayed politically\nSo that fat as just considered another to issue a equal with muscle and to say that that's not true is to be mean to fat people pat phobic as they call it\n... and that was accepted\nYeah that was expected that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity or who wrote that who we claimed that paper and you actually as a professional body builder\nOr Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind of this guy being the author of this paper fat body building was just kind of whole area\nBecause that was another thing to a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean it some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking would it would it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean those kind of a it's a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship stand or fall on merit not on who did it and so\nLot of people are are making that point and we deliberately chose names that would be hard to find in a Google Search in a district which was very common names on purpose I actually used\n\nWhat if this were published and they were real if\nThis were published ... what what would that mean to the university system would what does that mean\nSo all these answers are really complicated I'm there would be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some uh educators primarily working and social justice size field topics\nCourses I guess the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general at stuff would take up some degree of the suggestions as\nYou know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to the gold standard journal this wasn't some fringe journal and education this was the gold or tennis philosophy journal Asia that we were working with here\nWhich is where a lot of the literature that like this already exist which you don't mind me going on a little bit this is kind of what's happening I'm we think that what's happening here is kind of in the equivalent with ideas of money laundering called idea laundry oh\nSo they take they take these these bad ideas some of which are just opinion some of them are prejudiced some of them are genuinely terrifying like this educational thing and then they wander them through the academic process and they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge so you're\nOh well there was a study or we face this program on studies that show well that's fine when the studies or could but when the studies are coming from a place they can't tell a truth from from prejudiced and opinion it becomes a real problem\nTeams one of the other ones I found um disturbing or was\nThe uh H. O. H. two ... two was was accepted can you explain explain this one\nYeah that paper was accepted by high pay showed the singer and I was just mentioning that\n... stood for a hoax on hoaxes so it was a hoax paper we wrote that was a ballot writing academic hoaxes just the code namely gave for convenience what it argues is that that you can\nOnly properly criticize things that go against social justice and in particular you can only use humor to make fun of or or do satire to deflate\nThat which goes against social justice if you use humor against social justice if you criticize both will do that what that means as you never really properly engaged with it therefore we don't have to consider your criticism and that's one of the huge problems going on in this this set of of\nFields is that they don't accept criticism if you tried to criticize them they say that it's a privilege preserving epidemic pushback that a scholar named Allison Bailey huge huge\nIn the education literature they say it's white fragility that's Robin to Angelo who has just had a big book published on that this year but it introduced the concept of twenty eleven which says that if\nI'm somebody with privilege in particular white people for her work ah is challenged so that their privileges Clinton question that they are fragile and don't know how to deal with it because their privilege made them weak\nThey don't know how to psychologically deal with having that challenge and they act out in anger or grief or something like that and trying to maintain their privilege and so\nThese ideas are already getting out there we just took him to step further\nAnd then the you know it's interesting guy because the one about hoaxes is interesting in that if two to criticize what you guys did they would almost half just cite your paper as that was\nThe idea yeah it was definitely to put them in that position and I've asked ... to stand by the paper that they accept it and publish in our right names they haven't responded yet\nBut we'll see what they do I'm that way indeed people who want to criticize our project from a position of interest I can all feminist them we'll need to cite cost in order to criticize us\n[laughter] I could we could one more to Glen ... on the Utah joined us on the scary front at the feminist mine comp or\nWill you also did the white man my income if you did to one of his was accepted in the white man wasn't right\nCorrect correct tell me about them\nSo I'll do though the white one first because it didn't get in it was much more frightening it was written in from the position of an auto West Nile graffiti where the researcher is reflecting on and hurt the state's her own experience\nAs a white lesbian women coming to hate her own white mass and it was rejected partly because the scholarship wasn't quite er which is the case in all of the papers but also because the position is the author as a good white\nRather than being sufficiently saw what country or whatever to critical race ... ... so there was there was an explicitly political reasoning behind why it was\nWas rejected and it was that the the author as a white woman was trying to make herself look good by criticizing her own white was was one of the main reason the feminist one was\nWell hold on just a second hold on just saying that took\nMind the parts of mine Tom where he was talking about Jews and replace the words Jews with ah with whites\nYeah in that case it was either whites are white and this and then we edited the text around it and added a whole a whole bunch of literature and rewarded things get passed plagiarism checks and things like that so yeah that was a\nBit started with ... scanning through my income picking out passages about the Jews and replacing Jews with whites are white miss\n... than editing around it\nOr this having just one didn't do it quite the same way as soon as one was not about it didn't take Jews out and replace it with with men for example it actually has the chapter in my income where Hitler explains the need for the Nazi Party as chapter twelve and what its members would be expected\nTo a whole to and including especially the sacrifices that they have to make to be Nazis\nAnd we've replaced our movement the party et cetera he doesn't mention Nazis specifically in that chapter or we replace that with intersection of feminism or solidarity or ally ... something to do with with the feminist movement and criticize the idea that\nUh some feminists do what they called choice feminism which is the idea that if a woman is living her own life the way she wants to and considers that to be a statement of feminism than she is doing feminism it's salmon is for women to have you know full agency and make their own choices in the world that's what this paper was criticizing\nSaying that no no responsibility if they really want to consider themselves feminists is to be to make sacrifices him stand in solidarity with other oppressed people particularly of you know women of color or women of other marginalized status is\nJames [noise] couple of quick questions um they\nHad to be one of those things that you entered into and hope that you were wrong and when they were accepted you had to celebrate and then short time later going\nGood God this is bad am I right\nThat's exactly that is exactly right so especially the ... paper I think the one that got accepted\nThe idea there was that we were trying to it's very different from mine copy of course do I mean as you noted for one to one thing uh but the ... the the politics of grievance through I really am\nGlad I get to talk to you about that if I can because politics of grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic left as we were trying to demonstrate we called this stuff proven studies we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided a politically right now I was really\nHappy to talk to you because I mean I don't want to getting in touch with you but you're a real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this whole\nMay a ... about how things were going where you under Obama's time and I thought that was huge and I was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge she's looking for reconciliation is on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again\nSo our project was you know where people on the left were left liberals I'm not ashamed to say that I Know when you consider yourself a classical liberal and conservative on the right\nThat's great I'm we're on the left me to take responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that you\nKnow we're left wing people who want the left to come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all START I think you know people\nIn general I get a lot of sense of the people send me emails about this now all the time especially\nUm we're all kind of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to production politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think\nWeek is it five on Ninety seven point\nThe big Tucker from the Ninety seven point one the big talker

you\nCan find a lot of good and a lot of bad if you happen to be a Republican\nOr ... or rooting for conservatives to have a chance here to pass anything I'm obviously the both to really have a good chance of passing anything and that we've seen over the past couple of years even that is no guarantee you have to get anything done um but\nUh what you're seeing now is really good polling or for the GOP in the Senate a lot of these races that were close have moved to geo peas direction um to get to fifty is which is what they need of course to have control with Mike Pence was the deciding vote\nYou need to have a a there is about ten races there um and they've knocked out most of it's not just the ones that lean in their category get them get them to fifty there's the ... additional seven tossup races where they could get all the way up to fifty seven if they were to sweep those\nUm you know maybe even outside shot at something dramatic maybe even getting to fifty eight\nMost likely you're probably in that area of fifty three fifty four right now which is an improvement over the current situation in the Senate but if they lose the house that doesn't mean anything is that yeah you know it doesn't mean it means something but it doesn't mean a a heck of a lot 'cause you're not gonna be able to pass anything 'cause you know the house is going to both the other way\nAnd the houses where it looks real things look very bad for Republicans um it's interesting the way that they're looking at this is not whether usually it's like we'll we'll ever will the party loser gain seats\nRight that's the way we usually typically look at these things and then there's the control angle as well who will control the house\nFull even notice you haven't heard a lot of talk about whether Republicans\nWill will gain any seat largely because it looks like it's not even possible at this point in fact um the the polling models that they have working right now uh five thirty eight has one which they have um the ... the chance of Republicans can maintain their current amount of seats at less than zero point one percent\nAnd you might say oh well they've gotten you know there was issues with dating a Trump right which is the thing every time I talk about polls were like oh well they didn't get truck right well first of all the national polls are almost exactly dead on for Donald Trump or it just didn't get the\nAh electoral college right but that also wasn't what they were pulling and right and some of the states where we're obviously wrong but for example uh five thirty I Believe had about thirty percent chance that they thought Donald Trump or when they're saying there was a point one percent less than a point one percent chance that the Republicans will maintain the same amount of house\nSeats in the house in fact they're saying the\nEqual chance that Republicans maintain the same amount of seats as Democrats gaining eighty three seats\nNow both of those Arctic stream outliers right like I don't think either one of those is going to happen right but the chances of of of the of the Democrats just controlling the houses are about eighty percent again more certain if you want to use those words\nPolice nothing nothing\nI don't know if you saw the uh the mob and yes and I did use the N word gosh I don't know if you saw the mob in Portland this weekend but they had a a a law and order march and anti fall showed up for the law and order march\nGo to the countdown one twenty seven dot com check the facts to your spouse bone and now I'm not one twenty seven [noise] paid for by Arizona for affordable electricity prices any candidate a campaign committee\nIntroducing they are on the holiday tradition\nWillie hear this holiday season remember to shoplift\nMore holidays ... from the Arizona Lottery\nPlay for a million in prizes on tickets started again just tries to super size twenty dollar holiday down ticket with top privates five hundred thousand dollars now back to regular\nThis holiday you time for new leadership it's time to vote for evolution branch from the Arizona how\nWe should have dedicated our lives and publisher\nShe's been

leader to be our voice of the cat we vote for leisure French were represented the board by GPL committee for Arizona leadership not authorized by any candidate\nTheir retirement road map show with Germany for a weekend in Ninety Ninety seven point was that they talk more stimulating to\nHave some good news for you [noise] Arafat uh more than a thousand Honduran migrants are headed for the U.S border uh so\nWe got that going for us as well as if there's not enough chaos or in the country\nAre All right we're going to be a going out and basically I Would have some laughs or we're going to be out on our a tour addicted outraged tourists theater near you all you have to do is find out where and when it's Glenn Beck dot com slash tour\nYeah I'm going to be all over the country a check out the list I think it's gonna be a fun way of looking at the elect a little different than we are going to get from cold there for example\nHad lost the joy and at some point just before the bread so I was starting to lose the plot\nI become desperate to hold on to something I thought I might be losing and I thought I had to do something special to keep it\nI started doing things out of my comfort zone like presenting and the truth is it had been a while since I had been having fun\nIt started I started to worry about ticket sales for my tours what the critics said what the perception of bite me might be I felt like I was living with this over my face and near a and the reality I was seeing was all blurred by it\nI decided I never wanted to read my name and print again never read a review and I never have I decided I'd never use social media again and I never have but the diagnosis made me realize how stupid I had been to worry about all of these unimportant things I was embarrassed by my ego\nI was embarrassed that has allowed this in security\nI realize that for many years I couldn't believe I was on the same stage as my heroes I couldn't believe I was looking cross somebody like Paul McCartney and saying things like it's hard to get here\nMy God it's harder to stay here\nThan I woke up and sought after ten years of trying to get here in five years of being scared that it would go away I think I can enjoy it\n\nAfter his son's illness he says I just don't have the stomach for it anymore the celebrity narcissism it started I started to crumble but then I started to wonder why I wanted to do it in the first place\nI had forgotten that it was all about souls connecting because I become so anxious\nThere were people in my business life saying if you hadn't done this or that if you've written do better song tickets might be selling quicker I started to take all of that on board and no one wanted to take any responsibility it's just so much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was since insecure enough already\nI Would digest it and say it's my fault time rubbish\nIt affected me and I started to think it's all going to go I'm going to lose everything it\nIs fascinating to read these things from him because what I've always felt about Michael boo play was he was just having fun\nHe was just living a dream and I wondered and I never spotted in him I just wondered\nIf it was ever going to get old to him because what makes him I think the best performer I've ever seen on stage is that joy he just has a joy of performance and it is a it is so in fact was\nYeah he loves it I mean you can tell when you see 'em live you can tell he just absolutely loves doing it or at least did at one point um but they're starting to talk about I mean there's conflicting reports\nThat he's actually thinking about stopping it completely he says I was learning with passion that I was afraid I'd become a mere poor photo copy of my heroes but\nWhen I come back from this terrible time I realized I'm not a mere photocopy of learned everything I can from them taking it found my own soul my own voice my own\nThat away it needed clarifying now I've just seen the music I Love maybe when you let go that's when it comes back to you it's a lot like love\nHe is um he he I think he's joking about ... because he says I miss the guys in my band so when my wife had to go back to Argentina I said to the guys come on over to the house let's have a drink order some pizza place in video games and jam\nThey came over and we partied and I said let's play some music and I thought wow this is fun it was then that I realized I missed making music I didn't even know I missed it that was about a year ago so why would he possibly be saying that he is now\nIt seems like it might be one of those situations where the Internet has taken a somewhat a sarcastic comment and turn it into reality has his spokespeople are coming out today and saying that he's not actually going to retire because he's in the middle of a tour in a book or their album released and all that other\nStuff so here's what he here's what he says exactly to the reporter he pauses there are three reasons I wanted to do this album one because I felt a debt of gratitude deeper than I can explain to the millions of people all over the world who pray for us and showed us compassion\nGave me faith in humanity to because I Love music and I feel I can continue the legacy of my idols and three because of the world was ending not just my own personal health but watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe breakup\nNever a better time for music\nThen he suddenly stops quote this is my last interview he says quite solemnly I'm retiring from the business of made the perfect record and now I can leave it at the very top end quote somehow though the writer says I don't think he really means it\nIt's unbelievable because you know that it was put all over the media as if he was retiring well he said it was his last interview he's got other interviews scheduled right like he's had a whole press tour for this album is just silly and most important thing though is is looking at that and saying that that is really the type of thing that ... that changes your perspective completely right you\nGo through something like that and you stop and you examine all the nonsensical idiocy that you you participate in everyday or and you can re prioritize you don't want to have to go through that to do it but sometimes it's the only thing that makes you kind of re prioritize the things you're doing in your life\nOr and and he seems to have I mean he he is making thirty five million dollars a year if he's out there a touring and stuff and he's able to walk away from that um\nBecause he just wants to spend time with us on how many times a week here are close excuses I'm so according to what it is more time with my family that was completely real guy yeah it's nice to see somebody who actually you know as I used to see\nThat he he got through it and has made it into a good thing you know I have I have\n... probably more respect for Michael boo play than any other professional that I've ever met in the\nEntertainment industry because he has found a way to keep his feet on the ground and he was afraid I mean when everybody when everyone it was very popular to hate me\nShe didn't mean no hobbies or hate you I Know but he but he and he was never taking a stand for me he just wouldn't\nHe just didn't understand that he was like I'm I'm not in politics I'm Canadian why do I care and then you get out of it and then you get a fight at a ...\nYeah he said the guy turned around and said I could believe you'll look what Beck and he's like I'm Canadian Idol vote what what does it matter what does it matter to you and the guy threw a punch and he said I threw punches back and he said I gotta do it I got into a hockey fight [laughter] you got to do a hockey fight [laughter]\nI Am so happy to hear that his ah family is um is doing better and his son has made this miraculous turn\nAnd ah Michael ... you've given enough if you want to give more we will certainly take it but uh do what's right for you do what's right for you and for your family and your real fans will\nMatter what you decide [noise]\nI mean unless it's leaving music business than were pissed off [noise] yeah [noise]\nBy the way his new album is out in a few weeks a couple of tracks on it already been released and they're really\nGood really really really good [noise]\nAlright sponsored this half hour relief factor a relief factor is a way for you to escape the pain naturally\nDid you buy depending chance listen to the um a pod cast this weekend [noise]\nAh the one from you ... ... I mean I've heard a I I mean\nThey were there when we were recording so I listen to it again this weekend with my wife and uh he is the I just think he's wrong on this I mean I you know how do you say this to a to a father even though it did ah that lost his son to opioids\nAre because he's saying there's no reason for any of these opioids we shouldn't have any of them oxycontin Vicodin none of it should be available at all\nAnd um I just think that's really really wrong or 'cause we have a lot of people\nCertainly understand the position he's coming from\nFrom his position yes but I mean look at pat\nPat if he didn't have drugs I don't know what drugs these on but if he didn't have dry heroin many heroin yeah there are many days he wouldn't he wouldn't make it to the middle of the street to meet his dealer no he wouldn't make it to work he wouldn't be able to get out of bed yeah\nNow if you were in a situation where you want your life back and you've tried to everything may I suggest you try really factor stop taking all of the pain medications I have this I stopped taking everything last Christmas\n'cause I just I just couldn't do it anymore I just didn't want to live this way anymore and I have my life back\nA hundred per cent drug free created by doctors for key ingredients that help your body fight against inflation and that's where the majority of our pain comes from try it tried for three weeks they have three quick start it's Nineteen Ninety five Seventy percent of the people who ordered the three week quick start go on to order order more month after month\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but\nJust so hostile to ... ... it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean eight pounds so it sounds so it's this is confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left we want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western\nSocialists they think still functioning\nAt a democracy but but that's that's what they want us so we shouldn't be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich\nSay what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nThe problem with that is that so many people expect politicians to not keep their promises that I don't know how big of a scoring points that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on it it will review says he's going to do something he's going to do it or die trying\nWe don't have a war yet but not for lack of trying and we don't have the full repeal of Obamacare yet but not for lack of trying now the Democrats are often running here on a couple of 'em read birth issues I don't know if you've noticed it or not but all of\nA sudden Trump wants to once again take away\nHealth insurance from people with pre existing conditions where did this come\nFrom out of thin air it came out of thin air there's no way Trump wants to do this there's no Republican wants this is the reason the Republicans didn't go on for a full repeal of Obamacare as pre existing conditions\nWhich you get down to brass tacks preexisting conditions being coverage is not even insurance there's no way you can get insurance if your house catches fire and then go buy insurance nobody's going to sell your insurance wants to houses on fire or after it's been robbed\nSo we're not even talking about insurance but we are as far\nAs the general public is concerned so I don't know where all of a sudden Donald Trump and every Republican candidate for the house in the Senate wants to take away\nHealth insurance or preexisting conditions when did this happen no Republicans out there saying that\nIt's sort of like when Joe ... a ... a joint Stephanopoulos was interviewing um ah well questioning Mitt Romney in a debate\nAnd he asked if you think the states should be able to ban contraception Romney look the rest of what\nNobody's talking about that stuff and I don't care for that he's talking about I Wonder when you think ... states have a right to ban contraception round the looks around I guess what we're not talking about ... George I don't think anybody I don't think anybody would even think of this I don't know why are you asking me I\nJust want an answer quit stalling\nYou in the states will eventually Romney answered it and it didn't matter\nWhat the answer was it allowed the media Renee\nDiscusses states banning contraception\n[laughter] that's all it took and the Republican war on women\nWas reborn and that's what this pre existing condition garbage let me see what the real issue with the real\nIssue that is raising its head out there that the Democrats don't want to talk about his immigration illegal immigration that remains the issue that cola lessons\nRevolt Republican voters no matter what other issues they have that is the issue it has been poll driven and tested in terms of being a very helpful to Republicans and of course the Democrats don't want to talk about it after ...\nThey're trying to gin up all this stuff about pre existing conditions Leslie stall here trying to do the same thing by suggesting that\nTrump is hostile to our good friends in Europe and just you sound so hostile why would you want to sound so hostile it's like when she was talking to host Jose Rodriguez why would you give them in short that's the stuff they give cancer patients so I mean that's not who we are so you're so hostile and ... what is hostile\nThe way they treat us is what's hospital we're not hostile she says yeah but you can't deal with it without he says we have been the stupid country for so many years and that you find\nThat you're willing to get rid of the western alliance no I like NATO NATO's fine but you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO\nYou know what else they said in his interview secretary of defense Mattis\nCame up Trump's that I Know more about NATO than matter does [noise] [laughter] [noise] I don't work man is as far as the deep state is concerned yes\nNATO any army general would be nice though Trump\nJust [noise] as Vanity Fair magazine says and it's surprising admission sixty minutes\nWas out matched by Trump the president talked over Lesley Stahl at a rate let loose blaster Miranda ... seemed more rally an interview\nLeslie stall will not be happy ... of Vanity Fair and they all live for puff pieces and\nVanity Fair particularly news people 'cause then any fair you know is is Hollywood star celebrity mecca magazine and if you had mentioned Vanity Fair\nEurope done massive crossover you've crossed over from news do entertainment\nSupposedly doing both not to be just my Vanity Fair that's not a bullet point that's not a resume enhance or\nMinutes aired an interview with Trump rare for its status as having appeared outside of Fox News or conservative media appearing the same weekend as first lady Melania Trump on twenty twenty\nA new level of media blitz seeing on the part of an administration that already seen its head get plenty of free promotion during rallies broadcast on cable\nNews\nAnyway they go on to trash Leslie stall and trash CBS for letting Trump\nWalk all over them to just continue to dominate\nWith reading length list rhetoric CBS let Trump get away with the same kind of persona and the same kind of stuff that he says\nAs he says\nAt his rallies they say Leslie stall interview with Trump was an undeniable get\nHe'd been scarce on mainstream media since around the time he appeared on tape what Lester Holt and NBC and indicated he'd fired call me in part due to the Russia investigation but the interesting governed by two motives both of which played in the hands of the media savvy president\nWho's refusal the play by typical rules of engagement has been at the center of his rise\n[noise] you know people in the meeting and say oh you want he's been the most media accessible president you've ever had this guy will stop and talk to your wherever your gathered if he's on the way somewhere and sees you he stops\nIn talks to you and he tells you exactly what he thinks it's not his fault if you can't keep up with it it's not his fault if you can't play your usual journalists games and dominate him and get away with re characterizing what he says looks like or thinks\nVanity Fair just admitting ... very very frustrated that they can't treat Trump successfully the way they treat all other Republicans they want to get rid of\nYou know read about it in the paper tomorrow ... be met more talking bugs news on the\n[noise]\n... and this is the ... stock market report simple wealth management at investment banking tied to check in with chief investment officer Michael ...
