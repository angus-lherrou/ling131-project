Tea Party and they were accused of being racist and they were accused of being violent which they weren't meanwhile the press and politicians excused people like ... and it's getting worse and

way we consume politics is a mess and lots of our political discussion itself is a mess\nBut I think it's really important to distinguish between two dimensions one dimension is a continuum from right to left and on those issues I'm as conservative as they come on anybody score card on the second or third most conservative senator or in the United States Senate\nUm but the second dimension is about the intensification of politics and how Central Asia should politics sit in your world view\nWell better ... they're manufactured right here in America and ship free within twenty four hours and you

to do a um an hour and a half uninterrupted podcast with me under when you have time\nUm because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood\nAnd parts of it challenged I'm sure but uh I I Would like to just pick up on this point so the number one\nDriver of happiness is vocation your one guy that will understand that if that's true in the next ten years we're in deep trouble\nWe're headed toward a really interesting time in human history it's scary and fascinating so somebody some people shorthand for this\nWe're headed toward a really interesting time in human history it's scary and fascinating so somebody some people shorthand for this ... of the economy I think the simpler way to think about it is just um\nThe average duration of people's jobs or their relationship at a firm is going to get shorter than ever before in human history so let's go macro for a minute hunter gatherers throughout most of human history\nYou don't have any conception of what your job is you pursue that buffalo right and then ten thousand years ago people settled down and started\nPlanting and harvesting and we we enter farm on a on a regular cycle and from ten thousand years ago to hundred and fifty years ago nobody had job choice they just did with grandma and grandpa mom and dad and aunts and uncles had ever had done forever eternity past with the industrial revolution we get jobs specialization and it was really disruptive\nBut when people took a job they still kept it till death of retirement to not everybody graduated high school at the beginning of the industrial revolution by the end almost everybody does\nBut you still get one job at some time between Fifteen and twenty two years old and you keep it for all of your life I was born in the Nineteen seventies average duration at a farm for a primary breadwinner then it was still twenty six years now it's four years and getting shorter and it's got to get shorter forever more McKenzie a farm I used to work with\nBelieves that fifty percent of the American labor market by three years from now this is not Twenty years in the future\nThree years from now they think fifty percent of the labor market will be primarily freelancers meaning that most people will cobble together a bunch of different jobs not all of them are going to be ap enabled tech jobs like being a new driver with the right software that makes you more efficient than an old school Gabby\nBut what's really going to happen is we're going to head toward a world where people are gonna get disrupted out of their jobs at aged forty and forty five and fifty and fifty five forever more\nWe've never ever done that in human history and so it means all of the banks of what's often called now the quarter life crisis this sort of late adolescence crisis of trying to figure out your your role in life and how do you go from just being a consumer and mom and dad's house to be in a producer\nThat can not just put bread on the table for your kids can actually have a sense of meaning that you're serving your neighbor that disruption\nThat most people know in late adolescence working experience that again every three to five years for our whole life and that means there's a lot of new potential for upheaval and frankly for unhappiness there's going to be more economic output\nThan it's ever been produced before in human history but it's not at all clear that it will redound to the median family and the median household and the media and worker or going to have to become a civilization of lifelong workers able to get retrained when you're forty nobody's ever done that before\n[laughter] okay so there's about an hour of questions on on that one uh but I've got about three minutes left can you give me a ... your take on the\nFirst real political upheaval that we're going to see that I think by twenty twenty you could change everything could start global wars deep fakes\nYeah so one of the reasons I wrote them is because I spent a lot of time on intelligence issues and I'm In the intel community there are people who talk about the\nPerfect storm of deep fakes that we have coming and the storm is these three ingredients number one new technology makes it possible to sort of narrow cast a world with fake audio and fake video where lots of people can be susceptible to being sort of um a\nSpoof or persuaded the things that aren't real are real\nThere's always been enemies doing malicious actor you know information warfare since the beginning of time you can find it in proverbs in college he asked these uh to sow discord in an enemies tent\nBut it used to require a prostitute and honey trapping effect business partner in a bribery scheme and more right you had to get people around people number one is now we can use technology to surround someone and give them a fake experience and ... are fake audio and fake video\nThat are going to seem real to make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad at it the real reason we need to take that Russia type investigation so seriously as because China's right behind them running scout team off since I'm On them and ready to do\nBig deep fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and business officials and the public at large and number three we had so many internal divisions about geography about race about gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided\nThat we are susceptible to these kinds of campaigns\nLike Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they try to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL dealing controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media in the first Seventy two hours after that flamed\nLast fall the majority of it on both sides stand for the anthem and taken the NFL most of it was Russian on both sides and so we're going to have a world where you're going to have things like the Kavanaugh hearings were all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer's strategizing with Michael ... or video will appear it'll be fake\nBut video well up here and it will be Kavanaugh partying hard as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake but in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be\nA potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them a why we hate each other is an awareness that there is actually national security exposure for this country and how much we hate each other around politics we need communities of people that live\nIn the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise]\nHow come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\nAh it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some nut job somewhere in a McDonald's right now who probably slapped an old man wearing a mock a hat and or\nThat person is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of ... pecking and so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but that's the that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have about thirty thirty seconds I'm not getting even ask you I'm not even ask you I Would like to ask you to come down a Ben and and really unpack this uh because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood and I think in soundbites\nUm it's not to not always understood I'm so thank you very much\nTo the capitalist system and you say she's she's advocating\nSocialism not ten not Canadian socialism socialism communism she's talking about state run and owned property in business is now that's that's not a welfare state\nOh you're a conspiracy theorist weight she just said it at one point\n[laughter] oh I mean first of all the ... you know the press is a collection of individuals some of which do a good job some of which do not\nAh so it's important to make those distinctions I think um and you know look at that is a this was just this is going on at our founding you know people were doing it at our founding and it at our founding but we but we we realize is when we were in a gauge and informed populace we chose correctly\nRight I mean I you know if we're not\nWell we know what the what we know a republic if you can keep it right and if we if we don't choose to keep the republic well then of course it's going to fall apart we knew this was an experiment and that was the risk of it\nAnd I think we are seeing some some of those risks pop their heads up but I mean the whole foundation of this country is to let people uh come out and make their arguments\nAnd we have to make our back that does not mean I'm a ... thing and I was so encourage I Hope you are too so encouraged by the ... ... a reaction from conservatives\nShe Nancy Pelosi shouted down a and I did not see a\nPeep of support from conservatives over the actions of the people protesting hunting I didn't see I was disgusted by I was disgusted by it as well and I didn't see any I didn't now I'm not saying there were none I'm sure people will show me a tweet if some you know not job it was like I think they should harass Nancy Pelosi at dinner\nBut I didn't see one prominent Republican or conservative support those actions not one you could see if we can we played dozens of Democrat and you know\nHere's here's here's one from Sean King I've said it before but I Need to say it again I'm grateful for ... it's weird that it's politically incorrect for me to say so but\nI'm Glad we have people in this country who stand up to fascist and a bigotry and are willing to confront ape face to face right and you know there's nothing on the left there\nEven prominent politicians yeah I I have not seen one prominent conservative support what happened diplomacy and that's right and I'm Glad they mean that that shows that there's still you know even though we're divided and even though a lot of things come down to the minute you know emotional politics that go minute to minute I'm Glad to see that they're still principles there so here's where\nI think Ben was wrong when he said to deal with the ... um she was right when he said you know it's a small group it's a small group them she's right\nIt is a very small group and they become very very loud because of social media and because of the media\nBut it is a small group where I think he's wrong is ignore it\nIt's a part of the solution is ignoring yeah and I think you know because you can't get to the point where like I Would say the same would apply to the ... right right you know the Charlottesville situation um you know\nThere's obviously a crime committed there that you can't ignore right um but generally speaking when a bunch of Nazis or KKK members that's been happening for every person go back for a broken bunch of KKK members walk through your town like ... you know largely speaking it's great to ignore them because they want attention and they run they\nBut that's not what we have now we have to a breaking laws you can't ignore them not came you know you can't ignore that I don't I don't care if it's the Nazis or ... you can't ignore\nIt and I don't think that's what argued nor the right I mean like I think he's saying that we get a little bit too wrapped up in\nThe back and forth of viral videos and people who are not even really engaged in politics [noise] getting freaked out over things that they're never going to have to necessarily deal with if you just missed a group like add to fall though that's how they grow\nOr and or at least arguably that's how they grow their own oppose you're seeing it happen in Portland right in the mayor is largely just ignoring what they're doing and it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse that does not mean our lives have to be ruled by anti father and I think that the generalize argument he was going for\nWell the the the key here is what do you do about it and\nThe solution is to not to do what people did in Florida with Nancy Pelosi you don't do that\nBecause that doesn't give you a side to run to\nYeah you don't do what the Proud Boys are doing I'm Sorry but it's just when you talk to Gavin about that yeah and I think Gavin is even you know looking at things going again you know look we were we were doing things because you know it's funny\nA media yeah he's a comedian um but you know this this will grow out of control you just don't do that 'cause there's nowhere to go when you're watching that you're like well I don't like\nWell Nancy Pelosi is doing but I don't like whether they're doing\nSo who do I go to and look at look how the press is treating Donald Trump because\nThe press treated Kavanaugh\nEverybody kind of hard and their positions didn't they\nEverybody just hardened their positions and got more outraged the only the only thing that might have happened is\nIndependence looked at that and said you know what I don't want to be with those people left the left and and I don't want to be with the I don't want to be with the left and then looked over to the Republicans they weren't misbehaving during that\nBut\nAre we doing to welcome people in if your kind of saying I don't want to be with those guys and then you see [noise]\nWhat are we doing to welcome people in\nIf you're kind of saying I don't want to be with those guys and then you see [noise] you know you ... get out get out there pounded on ... and I'm like okay I don't we\nCan't we can get to a place to where people disengage because if they do completely disengaged then it's just run the country is run by radicals\nWe need to be a safe haven we need to be a place of real thought real actual kind is um and real principals\nAnd we have to present a rational logical alternative I mean that is one of the reasons I'm a conservative right right\nI saw the left you know early in my life as a group of people who made decisions emotionally yeah and that's not something I Want to be\nPart of snow and we can't be a part of that we can't do that ourselves let me go to Andrew in Florida hello Andrew you're on the Glenn Beck program\nGo in the morning first time caller longtime listener I all during the day very good oh right yeah you know I I just wanted to let you know I mean I'm here from Florida\nOf an independent uh most of my adult life and I'm exactly what you guys just said\nThat if a tree all on both sides it's so ridiculous I think a lot of the independent just stay out of it because it's so immature and it makes everyone on both sides but bad because they just can't talk to each other anymore it's just at\nOur God now that being said\nEvery one that I Know it's an independent\nAnd the state of horror will be showing up for\nThe conservatives November really an ally in that you\nSent over eat them you got people in office ... off just right now out there that are fighting for lower taxes I might bringing home over three thousand more dollars this year than I did last year which is a huge\nDeal for me I've got two little girls and I've got one more recently I got my first uncommon in eight\n[laughter] uh yeah I mean yeah\n... ... ... there's there's things like that are going on and on and I'm a conservative Christian showed up at you when you're when you're talking about\nWhat these people represent and how they ... themselves into a restaurant that can hurt people when they're eating with their family or most dependent and they think exactly the way I just so disgusted with some of the\nRhetoric on both sides we just ignore it and we always been independent thinkers or we're going to stay that way we also know what's wrong is wrong and what's brightest right as far as\n... concerned I think a lot of people underestimate that\nWell Andrew I'm you if what you say is true ah than people are a ... than the Republicans will keep the house most likely\nA because it is so close at levels we've never seen of interest in participation in the mid term election ever a and it's it's within the margin of error between\nThe two that if the independents come out and they are that they could be the ones that make all the difference on which direction we go next so much Andrew\nSo filter by is our sponsor and I I ... in a last week because doing I'd been

I'm tired of the same old politics and uh Larry sharp is joining us now\nHe is running for governor in a New York and I think his ideas need to be heard and he needs to be a needs to be introduced to a larger audience how what is your organization like what's your ground game\nYeah we have we have probably the best um obtained ground you might see in the long time um if probably ever we have over seven or eight directors campaign manager\nAbout thirty five to fifty people who are actively working every day on every aspect of the campaign to include things like a scheduling setting up a van ... uh fixing our calendar\nOr making sure people show social media we have a a team on Twitter or team on Instagram a team on Facebook we're we have a team when everything's Youtube video production\nAnd you don't have but you you're lacking money you're up against people who have tens of millions\nOf tens of millions of dollars absolutely we raised almost half a million but to be to be clear if in these last couple of weeks if we raise another fifty thousand dollars hundred thousand dollars this becomes winnable I Know it sounds crazy but it is and the reason is name recognition is my only issue\nThe last poll we put out I was at about one third name recognition and with that I pulled that Thirteen percent\nSo you can do the math on that one three times to get to a hundred percent equals thirty nine percent right through time Thirteen or ... percent\nThis is a five way race thirty percent when this thing so I'm nine points above victory assuming I get a hundred percent\nThere is the hard part right the math equation can I get to a hundred percent and sadly that's not my message I've got that down it's the media can I get my name out to enough people to where I cross over that barrier which gets to be over thirty per\nSe I Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win\nYes ... ... it has really is that we'll get to get remember at as third party in general the system is stacked against you and some of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine mentality could do this\nBecause every day I'm up against failure but the marine corps taught me take the hill the captain shot take the hill the machine guns broken take the hell\nRadios don't work take the hell are stopped give me excuse it take to get it and that's what I Do I take the hill as a matter I get I literally deal with failure every day this woman everyday and when I say that that's not an exaggeration\nThat's every single day as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS and they're only going to include the Democrat Republican even though I'm On the ballot even though thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition to get me on that ballot\nWCBS they got him Tim Shell I think his name he decided nope barbershop dozens of beyond their he decided that the establishment is all that matters this is what I'm up again it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle we have to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that uh you think should be heard than you should probably um maybe tweet storm\nWhat's his name again at CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think the temp shelled so this is a radio debate yes well it can be televised also now okay we both televised and radio ... okay\nSo yeah again and they're just decided you know we don't want that they'll me wrong there are three other people should be ... should also be the Green Party and also the damn party they should all be there but this is the norm and we put up against this with against is constantly and here's the the worst part with all of this we're still roaming\nAnd they're still going down that that that that but they don't they don't\nThey don't realize that when a sinking ship mhm or maybe they don't care\nIf people want to donate how's he doing\nLarry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you want to get forty five thousand dollars you can't the maximum forty four thousand\n[laughter] by New York state law so if you I Know what sometimes I I Want to get by forty five thousand dollars sorry you can't do it forty four you only can get forty four thousand it's all you can get well okay you\nOver ... million since he descendants round\nOver a million ... leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million look they're voting with their feet when it yes it is so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo because older retirees we have\nAre going to Florida and they have pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent in New York state they being spent in Florida we're lily we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month horrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pensions though ... pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for it yup you've you're going to break all of the promises ... who worked their whole life and were promised ally yep what do you do\nYou see it here in Texas would you please for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you'd have already already happening every of all the time you're in New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation mhm so pensions are critical right now pending or about Fifteen or sixteen percent of our budget and a budget is a hundred and Seventy billion dollars it's double Florida in Florida has more people than us\nWow yes for about eighty five billion that more people than us and we have a hundred and Seventy billion dollar budget about just massive\nAnd it's getting bigger the budget getting bigger and so are the percentages of the other pensions but on top of that a New York state has about three hundred million dollar debt and about a four to five episodes\nSo it's a bad bad bad anyway you add that people I was telling me about Lowry the pension fund is good they write the fund itself is a relatively well some of the upstate ... up and you're doing very well some of the city wants or disaster but overall certain well they don't realize it's being also funded by\nOur tax base our budget that keeps putting money into it the problem is and the fun right now that's great the problem is the actual budget at one point it gets so big that we simply can't pay me more as you're seeing in Dallas and my response times but Larry in the constitution yeah I I get that asked Detroit\nRight at and Puerto Rico right at Venezuela ... it was all legal for them to one there's no money it does get funded when it doesn't get funded that eventually will collapse if that collapses if our pension fund collapsed near state we become Somalia overnight\nI don't want to become a Somali overnight I Want to stop that I'm the only guy talking about negotiating our pensions into the right which is some type of four one K. for three be something like that and I'm going to go shoot with every single union that will take forever I Know that's why I say it's a four year plan\nIt's a four year plan to make us or what New York state is paying either a flat fee and or a ... percent of that sustainable because the issue we have is a a lot of people were pensions who no longer paying it any more mhm so we just have to keep paying them until they don't even use anymore so we have to do that also\nUsed to be like ten firefighters supporting one now it's one supporting to\nDirect I think actually were supporting for ... I think that's right I'm not sure but I was making the biggest thing I think are supporting three or four or so yeah\nIt's bad so now we have to make that change and the funny thing is people are attacking me thing live wants to get rid of our pensions I'm like I'm the only guy trying to keep them on the other one talking about reality I'm Talking I was actually happening if you ever if you're ready for a pension now it's ten or Fifteen Years from now it's\nProbably not going to be there for you but\nWhy deal with that I mean it's human nature why deal with that if the two on the other side GOP and the Democrats are saying oh he's an extremist he's he's trying to spook you your pensions are fine it's human nature to follow them\nAgreed but I have a problem Glenn I care\nI have a problem I'm human I have a problem I Want people to stay in my state I Want people to stay in my state because if they don't my state's gonna collapse and I have to move and I don't want to move I'm born and raised in New York state my family and friends were in New York state I Love my state ... people love New York the heat and the U.S government\nNew York state is very special it has served the largest city in the entire nation it has an amazing waterfall in Idaho Falls it as mountains as cool as Colorado and has farmland and will as yes I'm In New York ... no ... no farmland as cool as in mid west\nIt has amazing rivers and lakes and every you can imagine in New York state is there is a beautiful diverse state\nAnd what destroying it because wedding one city run the entire state\nMost of my my ideas about happiness but the other part is by decentralization it's about letting counties be counties in regions be regions in towns towns right people upstate tend to get upset with people in New York City saying well they're running it and they are bad and cut them off\nIf you ran your own county you wouldn't care and that's what I Want to let people in New York City New York city is an ...

not a caravan folks this is this this is\nIt's an invasion it is an invasion\nJust like that which occurs every day and has been at the southern border for many many decades\nI mean it's it's an invasion that has so far lead to a minimum twelve million illegal aliens of the\nCountry and these incessant calls for amnesty for all of them\nBut let's see what happens when they are supposedly a week out let's see if the organizers\nOf this thing began to deny the members food and water\nLet's see if the people behind this creating a humanitarian crisis one week before the Irish jeweler

coming that might oh well it's a perfect storm that could be coming to fruition here\nThis is the ultimate October surprise that we're still trying to figure out who's behind this year's lonely ... from Texas He was on today with Sandra Smith on Fox question what can you tell us what you're seeing the way the president's responding to this what are your thoughts as this mob makes its way to the border\nThe president made no bones about it and uh actually he can take his lead from the Democrats a Democrat and I'm One door Wilson not one of my favorite presidents but in Nineteen sixteen after ... gangs came across\nThe border in New Mexico and killed a bunch of people not only did he put Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's are going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and it needs me stop\nAnd Louis continued to close the border you gotta stop bogus asylum claims and basically had those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from\nAnd also we need to remember that asylum claims are not\nLegitimate if they're not married and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so ... El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim and Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps DVD I talked to Louis he'll talk about Japanese talking to Jeff and I won't even know who is tight and who you're talking\nWith Jeff Sessions suggested big buddies that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all great points they already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in afterwards Gabe in\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning anything\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any room breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\n\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't been here for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nIs that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point advantage that the American people realize their mistake electing Trump Republicans I'm couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argue against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason\nThe two thousands actually in midterms the American people were all of a sudden going on that all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in ... I don't\nBelieve it but we got media narratives that a gigantic blue way of what's going to happen and we had that media narrative\nGo on from December last year all the way through\nSeptember of this year and then and then\nThe generic ballot started tightening and then it began to look\nMaybe it won't be as big a blue wave\nAnd Republicans look like they might actually gain seats in the Senate and\nOh no now the president's approval numbers is higher than it ever been CNN on poll forty four percent\nRasmussen has trumpet fifty one\nThere is nothing happening that\nSuggests say blue wave is happening I frankly don't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth\nI eat election day people have to start reeling in news Madden cat predictions projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they can for the sake of their business\nThere in the polling business is they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all about the case who hire them\nSo now we're told well there's been a shift a little bit and it may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways that Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republicans can hold the house foreign ways they could lose the house\nWith a month ago there was no way the Republicans were going to hold out now all of a sudden we're starting to see it as a blue wave may not I don't think they ever did\nI don't think he ever did exist I think it made up\nManufactured you get to pull result you want depending on when you take the pole and who you decide to put in your sample\n\nThere is no way there is simply no way that a political party openly promoting this\nInvasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive landslide\nWhen the American people are not angry that we have not\n\nStopped this the American people in mass are not wanting more illegal immigration\nThe American people in a majority no matter how you slice an are not asking for a political party\nTo stop paying attention to the border and let everybody who wants to him in the American people are not there the American people never been there the Democratic party is there and the Democratic party wants you to think a lot of Americans are there but they aren't\n\nGoing through your own poll wherever you hang around do you think we ought to basically eliminate the border to let anybody wants to come in and I can guarantee you less than ten percent of the people going to say yes and yet\nThey look at a drive by news media every day and you would get the impression there's a lot of Americans that a lot of people to support this idea\nOf these are so poor people there there's the hungry we'd be we have so much they have so little we must but that's not\nA position it's going to win elections if it were we would have had amnesty back in two thousand two\n\nIf that was the position of a majority of the American people Donald Trump would have never gotten the Republican nomination if the people\nOf this country wanted mobs of seven thousand or eight thousand to be admitted into the country no questions asked to be granted asylum Trump won a never got the nomination he certainly would not have been elected\nObserve seven thousand or eight thousand to be admitted into the country no questions asked to be granted asylum Trump would've never got the nomination he certainly would not have been elected president so you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think we'd go up\nYou know what Trump was wrong we don't need a wall this proves we just need to let these people in that's the way to stop the chaos they want and let them yet and we should feed them we should house than they have nothing there port are coming from ... separate countries left them that's not\nA majority opinion of the United states the media is going to try to make people think that way I look like they're mean spirited cold hearted heartless and all this but it's not the case\nThat's not an accurate description of the American people\nSo I none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever that Trump is in trouble because he wants to build the wall that he's in trouble and the Republicans are because they want to secure the border\nAnd yet the media reliably very subtly at this point sympathizing with the people on the quote unquote caravan\nTrying to find a way to make Trump look like the bad\nGuy here and that's just not where the American people are one other thing about this [noise]\nNow
