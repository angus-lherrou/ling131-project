they have to do is when the leaning states and they are to fifty which gets to control the Senate for at least a couple of years um there are six races in the top category\nAnd each one of those is

they're\nViolent or and racist activists so\nTell me who you really are Gavin tell me what you're really fighting for what is your vision of America\nWell first of all I'm not the leader of the Proud Boys I just started it\nThey they grew organically I just happened to be there and they ... ... as someone who wanted to stand up to the violence of antifa who were pepper spraying and culture in Lawrence rather than me and all these other people who just wanted to go through it talk and they haven't stopped\nWith this violence and inevitably when you're that while you get a grip slashing tires you're going to have the tire voice\nAt some point you're right so this group would not exist if and if it wasn't trying to shout people down in trying to\nI'm a ... take them out\nI don't think so I think you're just they just stay at a bar like the ... they wouldn't be coming out to defend people but more importantly the the way I feel personally is America's greatest country on earth\nBecause it's not about identity politics because\nIt's not about your accent like it is in Britain or or where you come from it's a ballot meritocracy come here you bust your ass you at least appreciate Judeo Christian values you would be an atheist but you have to understand that that is the backbone of the country and as long as you're you're part of that your rent\nWe don't care if they're from Uganda Singapore you bust your ass\nYou're into American values urine and there's not a lot of places like that in the world it's it's very rare to have that total lack of class as the man that admiration for independence and liberty and hard work\nAnd we got there through a horrible list of ups and downs and and rights and wrongs and trying to correct things we had slavery or treatment of the Indians was not a but what's that what you expect for someone to\nAnd commander in your cannon says\nBut we we we got here altogether through all this mat and all this suffering and here we are in the ... country of the world\nAnd we get people complaining thing America was never great and and that's what pissed me off and it's ironic that we ... we get called white supremacist because the reason we love America is it doesn't bother with all of that crap\nGame and we have this for a long time I think the media basically just said antifa was a baby didn't exist they ignore them completely and as the violence has escalated their new tactic seemed to be well yes there's violence but it is the Proud Boys fault or that the right wing ... have you noticed\nOr they're just exercising I my favorite is they're just exercising their First Amendment right of the assembly and Patricia of course of course I'm curious\nGiven if you detected a difference recently I'm In the approach from the media as it is trying to make your group\nThe real a village the real villain in this because I mean I I they were you know there was a ... a tweet string going on about the alleged violence by Proud Boys members and he was recruited by people like ... like the big time reporters were going after that you become I think a central target in this is that do feel that\nDefinitely I think the DNC put their uh hate is not hate has no home here that the\nOnly thing they have to say\nTo America and it's an idiotic thing to say that's like saying we we are sick of albino violence like what was this\nReally weird concept is evil Nazis and they said we're going to rid America of the clan and Nazis now there are not so they go ... uh we got to expand the net here so now anyone who disagrees with them as part of this evil hate that has to stop and I unfortunately have fallen into that that\nAnd it is [laughter]\nIt's amazing that anti ... and the media and the DNC are all in hopes like Cuomo was saying hey this is like a a match and you put it on dry dry grass and then the wind just takes it I think the matches and came for the wind is the media and it can't be are starting fires\n[noise] I don't I I have to tell you I have a hard time disagreeing with that I'm seeing the way the\nUh the left has just consumed the DNC I mean there there's you know when you when you're into a an organization where you're starting to say you know shout your abortion and um and and that kind of\nReally despicable kind of a a behavior you're bound and determined to start just going way off the rails and they're\nThey are they're they're the extremist party now\nAnd it's it's all getting so great I mean they used to and at the same as they've written by the way the way that it the anti uses and chief as their paramount till it kept paramilitary wing here or the media here says the jihad is over there and and the attitude in both cases the enemy\nOf my enemy is my friend and then she first language and the DNC language getting more and more similar just like that now that said we are not simple that's what he said well\nLet me go low or when they do a lot we kick them\nOr Maxine Waters saying no no freedom no peace or whatever go to their own attack that we've got people on CNN saying that Sarah Huckabee Sanders ... her ask for the rest of her life that's a life sentence it's at the same thing about Susan Collins they're setting race and\nTwo Republicans they got Rand Paul's wife sleeping with the gun we've got senator it's getting a text to be having a trick cabinet comes in I mean\nThat's who we are\nThose are the people we need we need to unite with with\nThe easy ones to get\nAre the ones on our own side\nAnd again is that I may disagree on a lot of things we disagree I I Believe that it would be much more helpful to take the Martin Luther King's pledge\nAnd go and walk through ... singing hymns and let them club you wouldn't have had go ahead let them club you in the head I Know that's not fun I don't want that\nBut that video of not breaking ranks and not punching back that video will speak to eighty percent of Americans\nThat video will cross all barriers and people will say okay look at these ... they're not even defending themselves look at what they're doing to them you put evil versus good side by side and people in America at least still at this point we'll choose good\nBut it has to be really good it has to be a shining example of good it has to be over the top good\nThat's why this is where we disagree I understand you know gather in in in ah the Proud Boys what they're doing I don't think they're wrong for wanting to do it\nAnd I don't think they're wrong for thinking that it's the right thing because how is it right now how is it wrong to stand\nBullies that was that wrong\nHow is that wrong if the police won't stand up if the media won't stand up ... who's going to so I completely understand that\nAnd I can't blame you can't like I get it I just think it's not effective\nBecause what happens is the media event just takes the piece of the video that they have where\nSomebody's swinging back and then they say it's their fault\nSo it's just not as effective do I want to get club in the head no no\n\nBut if given and I can't come together even though we have big disagreements\nOur disagreements or not on the things that actually matter we're not talking tactics the things that actually matter\nThe principles bill of rights\nConstitution declaration of independence Judeo Christian ethic\n\nFundamentally the left as you talked about this before shouting they're ... they're proud of their abortion and they're heroes the Proud Boys are proud of the west right and they're the villains or you know I think you and Gavin ... would agree completely\nOn on what to to be proud of the fact that ah you know what you are in the western way of life is is something to cherish it's a miracle it is and there's nothing wrong with with defending that at all or you know tactics are attacked tactics that side we have to if we don't defend it it's going to go away\nYou know we're all at the you know we're only one generation away from losing that says we all know and maybe it's a generation seems like it could be a week or two away at this at this rate\nSo we have to sit there and defended it it's just you know what's the best way of doing it and I think that there's a there's a discussion there um because I think you know I think as you know I'm Kevin would acknowledge me kind of talked about it in the interview they're going to be they're gonna be under the microscope now they got to be on the absolute best behavior as when the Tea Party was going on right when we went out and do these rallies\nIf there were you said don't bring signs\nBecause we know if there's one sign that out of place if one person makes one sign that had any hint of something bad it will be the entire story don't even brings on main street clean up when we when we walk away we want to look we want this or this area to be cleaner than when we got here and time after time after time\nThat happened and they weren't able to show that they would any evidence that they were violent\nSo here's the thing I think we were way ahead but Roger ales told me once he said you're so far ahead of the parade\nYou're about four blocks ahead they can't even see it was going to be walking by herself when they're horrible at the head of the parade you're just it was his point on a stroll that was his point and he said you're so far ahead and I said well I I don't know I'm just doing what I feel is right and he said slow down your way too far ahead\nThat was the best advice he ever gave me I never listened to in a a ... who is good advice and I think you know when we were talking people used to say all the time why you're talking about Martin Luther king why are you talking about Martin Luther king when we went to Birmingham I said I Want everybody here which is a sign that that Martin Luther king thing\nWell there was nobody shouting us down there was nobody doing that and I said on stage there will be there will be\nThere's going to come a time soon where you're going to have to decide there will be these times in our future and you have to decide now\n\nWe're just ahead imagine doing imagined doing a rally now we were afraid\nOf the restoring honor rally because if you remember ride the black Panthers were going to come and they were going to engage us well the black Panthers joined with ah with Al Sharpton and they tried they just marched through\nThey didn't cause trouble they just marched through and we let them go and there's video of people saying good things as they're saying bad things to us we're saying good things to them now at the time it\nWasn't like ... in Portland\nAnd asked if I wasn't there\nIf you do a rally and is peaceful and asked to fall comes to attack and and we're the ones and we don't oh my gosh what am I saying God\nAnd we don't turn away we don't raise a fist\nThat's a different story now and one that people want to hear\nBecause people aren't believing the media anymore and they're seeing these words come out of there are Democrats I'm telling you all over the country that say look I maybe I Believe and abortion but I don't believe in that\nI don't believe in partial birth abortion I don't believe in hey abortion should be you know you should be proud of it go shouted it's great there's nothing wrong with it no\nNormal people look at that on the Democratic side I mean the voter that lives next to you they look and say look I don't want to be involved in those decisions but you know I I'm I don't agree with that\nI don't agree with that out of compassion medical because I don't know people's situation yes but if that's your version of the pill and your proud of it that's a problem\n\nThat's who America is and they're looking they're looking for a movement they're looking for someone they can stand with who just will call balls and strikes who are not going to say yeah that's right when Donald Trump tweet something stupid to say if it's stupid\nI don't agree with that but what he does something right yeah he did that look at that huh call balls and strikes that's where America is\nThe first thing we have to do is come together behind those principles I don't care if you are on the Democratic side of the Republican side or the independents ... I don't care I don't care who you voted for in the past I don't care what you believed in the past what\nDo you believe now do you believe we're on the ropes do you believe this system of government is worth saving do you believe this this capitalism is worth saving do you believe the the scientific method is worth saving\nRate than let's stand together and put our our differences of approach aside because we've got a lot of work to save this thing right now\n[noise]\nThe way Gavin has already been silenced on Twitter and invoices don't start coming together or more are going to be silenced what was it five or six hundred in\nA worse islands last week from Facebook and I don't see anybody talking about let's see anybody talking about and that kind of came and went and he got out of date no big deal [noise] sixty million followers [noise]\nJust disconnected from the voices that they were following last week sixty million\nAll right let me tell you about relief factor relief factor has been helping me a ... a a er um alleviate pain I'm starting to almost a year ago now is in December I was getting ready to go on vacation\nAnd uh we almost didn't go because my pain was so bad and I was just so desperate and a way to give it up it seemed like I had just resign yourself to this is just your life ... and I was starting to resign\nI was like I was at the time saying that's what I consider my wife I was a time saying I Can't live this way anymore I just can't do it I Can't do this every day\nYou know a two year old boy was shot and wounded by his three year old brother who actually fired a gun and got a hold of one\nOf the top wildlife officials in Idaho has resigned Idaho fishing\nGame commissioner Blake Fisher came under fire after posing with animals who reportedly killed during a recent a hunting trip to Africa\nThe Idaho Statesman published some of those photos showing Fisher with a dead giraffe another with a dead leopard but the one that's stirred the most outrage was a picture of this year with a family of did bad bones including a small baby boom right up front\nGovernor butch otter ask for Fisher to resign saying every member of my administration is expected to exercise good judgment commissioner Fisher did not kill NATO\nFox News on Wall street a big rally the Dow is up three hundred and sixteen points by maybe Anthony Fox news\nHour police they put their lives on the line to keep our community safe cures to cinema voted against\nProtecting our police opposing a bill to increase penalties for criminals who violently assaulted police officer they protect us but cinema didn't vote to protect them cinema also voted against increasing penalties from the gang members and violent criminals involved and drive by shootings\nAnd send them a defense sanctuary cities that stop liberal police from working with federal\nLaw enforcement to deport criminal illegal immigrants the sanctuary cities let them go rather than health kick them out of the country protecting criminal illegal immigrants instead of deporting them\nAnd send them out handcuffs are police and puts their lives in danger it's radical end it's wrong reject cures in cinema imagine the damage she do in the U.S Senate in\n... in the paper and it's not for the content of this advertising on the committee W.

the Saudis citizen he is not\nYou know despite what the journalist will tell you they they leave out the part that he is actually a Muslim Brotherhood and uh his problem with Saudi Arabia is that they wouldn't\nYou know a protector sanctioned the Muslim Brotherhood well you know Saudi Arabia knows who the Muslim Brotherhood is\nUm and uh so we had a falling out with the kingdom and then he had to go get a a you know divorce certificate he divorced his life in Saudi Arabia had to go into the Saudi embassy in it's in both turkey\nAnd he disappeared his fiance was waiting for him outside it appears as though the Saudis came landed a jet on the tarmac\nCame with a bunch of empty suitcases and bones saw chopped them up and put them in the suitcases took him out of the embassy put them on a plane and he's\nProbably scattered over some desert in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia said that's out land dish that's crazy yadda yadda the Turks went in ah apparently there was a massive cleaning crew that went in right before the Turks could go in and investigate\nAh the some more things were leaked by the FBI or sorry about the CIA et cetera and are now our secretary of state is over with the king of Saudi Arabia and it looks as though they are going to admit\nThat yes they did kill them a but it was an interrogation that just went horribly wrong and we're going to punish all the people that were involved\nIn this so now they're twenty four episode oh it's it's crazy now that this is I mean this is honestly rear window Alfred Hitchcock this exactly Alfred Hitchcock with somebody said that sitting outside going wait I\nI I think they drop her off of that cases the woman I think they dropped her up and then took her away in the middle of the night\nAnd everybody's like no that's crazy ... yep turns out it was and uh and it's the same thing here somebody sitting outside going I think they've chopped them up and took a mountain suitcases that it is the Hitchcock\nRear window and this is obviously going very arrive for the Saudis because you don't do things like this and expect to admit to and interrogation gone wrong two weeks later\nLike this is something you do and you deny me Russia does this all the time\nConstantly killing journalist and they're like I don't even know who I don't even know where that was what is ... ... am I've never even heard of that\nThat's their pattern and they never admitted if Saudi Arabia actually comes out of the ... yeah we kind of killed that journalists that's a big moment or in you know geopolitics that's not a tiny thing today\nOr how today or tomorrow the way the president answers Saudi Arabia when\nWhen they admit to doing this this is an ally a this is one of our bigger backers this is probably our best friend next to Israel in the middle east they stand against a lot of the stuff that we stand against there are a big supporter now of Israel\nUm we're in a proxy war in Yemen with that most people don't even know that but we're fighting a war in Yemen at their request and they're fighting with us\nUm they keep Iran at bay\nWe're about to sell them a whole load of arms they also dump money into our tech industry ... right now because of this um they also dump a lot of money into our banking system a\nHealth of the cool orb that what we should say that's a or pretty sweet shore okay the or predicts do we know that they don't ask the or why hasn't anyone interviewed the or about this incident notice how the orbit\nOr shows she only stuffed inside of it [laughter] stuff inside of how they ... they hide so um what is the president do what do we do\nThis why you don't get involved in these things because it's none of our business I mean I don't want it to be any of our business I don't want to have our whole economy and everything else hinge on what they just did when you don't like that we don't want to endorse it we don't want to be anywhere near it certainly feels different\nBut ... helped me quantify the difference here for a minute\nThese regimes are killing people all the time\nYes we know bad things are happening all the time and you know Saudi Arabia is not in any of these things yet is it just because it's a journalist is it just because it was on foreign territory in an embassy is it just because you know like the Washington Post really cares what happens to this guy so therefore it's become a big issue\nProbably also are going to tell them they need to be a incredibly uh open about punishing these people\nAre and sending that signal a and I think uh you probably wind up as a president with everything that you have to a deal with\nI mean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore we still have relations with a lot of a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist as sad as that is I mean this is you know then\nI remember all over the world this isn't this guy is not just a journalist he is a he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood that's really the problem here is that uh they believe that he was um\nYou know helping the Muslim Brotherhood against Saudi Arabia and possibly even helping the Muslim Brotherhood here in the United states so he's not just a journalist is that let's let's let's\nClear that up the citizen is Saudi Arabia on this really ... and it's not that they were killing him because he was a journalist but because of his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood\nRight I think I mean it's you know it's literally impossible to be able to judge all the moving parts behind the scenes that we don't know about ... you know that's\nWhy you have this is why you hire a president that you trust and and you know this is why you vote right because it's the situations that we do this with Bush I mean you you met with him during the war and he informed view of nothing a top secret or anything but a lot of the different uh things that you had to consider when making these decisions\nAnd you know it's easy to say well we should just never talk to Saudi Arabia getting thrown out there's a lot of things behind the scenes that they're doing for example helping in the fight against terrorism they've been a while obviously as we all know nine eleven or many of the people came from Saudi Arabia and there's been all sorts of questions on that\nAnd we've talked about distancing ourselves for a long time and this is probably a great a\nOpportunity to do that a little bit\nUm but you know there's there have been they've also arrested and killed a lot of terrorists or that have assisted us over the years as well I'm a on those efforts so I it's a tough one I think you have to\nYou have to send a signal you have to make sure I think probably sanctions or something if this is actually a proven um you have to you have to do something publicly but you look at Russia's done terrible things like that and we have in uh we haven't uh acted 'em any more or less selling arms to Russia\nNo no it's not selling arms to Russia and you know the idea that OK well arms sales help jobs is not a great argument [laughter] this is the one thing that we have to we can't really consider the economy first when you're talking about arms sales yeah um but I yeah I think taking that step of of probably sanctions and maybe that's what it is maybe it's arms um\nIs this going to be an important really really important decision for us was president Glenda [noise] um first I go back in history and I look at uh the Archduke Ferdinand moment\n'cause this is the exact kind of moment that the world thinks is no big deal that could spiral out of control so quickly mhm um I send my secretary of state over which is exactly what Trump did yesterday um like gather all of the evidence and then I Am as strong as I possibly can\nA under ...\nAnd everything ah that is currently going on trying not to weaken them but not necessarily empower them or as well and tried to get myself out of it in a long term strategy of getting away from the bad guys\nAnd and I think you know we're both going back and forth a little bit because we just don't know what's going on behind the scenes but not enough information to make this decision logical but will say that while I Am not a fan at all of this Logan American America First and I think it has a terrible history\nI'm In this situation that is your priority here is to make sure that whatever happened is whatever is in America's Best interest\nYou can't start a war you can start um uh you can't go crazy and to just to make a statement if the long term effect of this is a negative\nFor the United states we seen this with uh North Korea\nRight like I mean North Korea you can I think they get serious argument that ... I don't think Trump wants to go out there and be I mean you're talking about how he loves Kim Jong moon publicly I think he thinks that the best way to avoid negative consequences and if we're if I got a bunch of words it's better\nGood we were saying earlier last night on the news of why it matters again South Korea the time to take care of that was under the Bush administration we didn't or Clinton your Clinton now we didn't do it\nAnd now you're in a situation where you have no good options well welcome to the world that we ourselves created or allowed it to be created forest same

question how long has the medium [noise] been telling us and it's only a question of time [noise]\nAnd something happens that'll make Donald Trump\nSelf destruct they've been telling us this since prior to the presidential election they've been telling us since the campaign since Trump came down the escalator\nThree years ago June of two thousand Fifteen the media has been telling us and noted experts in the Washington establishment have been telling us that it's Trump Scott a self destruct\nSomething's gonna happen in Trump's going to blow up and everybody's going to see who the real Trump is and\nEverybody's going to be shocked and surprised and saddened and then everybody's going to want Trump's what their way but it never happens\nIt never happens instead [laughter] we keep watching his his critics self destruct Trump's opponents\nMelt down now practically every day over the fact that Trump isn't melting down they melt down over the fact that they can't make Trump melt down\n\nLatest example Pocahontas herself you want to talk about melting down and self destruction you are looking at it Elizabeth Warren you don't want I think I think there are there are four women here that attempted essentially an October surprise\nAgainst Donald Trump and they've all bombed out where to Hillary Dianne Feinstein focus on us and who is\nThe other there's there's one other woman they've all out and things these are in October and all of these I think we're destined to\nTo to destroy Trump and by extension the Republicans of course Dianne Feinstein running the balls the foreign scandal as an October surprise a Hillary Clinton and and and her constant a\nNeedle Lincoln products out there she's got something planned and always has habit it always blows up on her face\nAnd now Elizabeth Warren I is is melting down over this\nNow we have an historic seven point one million jobs open that means employers are looking to hire that many people\n\nThat you will say roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one\nWith that many job openings it is an employee ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employees can set the terms based on their level of expertise and experience with whatever it is they're applying for none of this\nIn the world of common sense suggests that people would be unhappy by or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told\nThat the American people are sick and tired they hate Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were barest by their vote\nAnd yet\nThere isn't a middle Lincoln bit of evidence that people have\nTurned around and want to vote Democrat including the two thousand sixteen presidential election\nFor those of us shouting at me why but we're we're storing food so we won the popular vote by three ...\nYeah but two things about that most of those votes came from California the second thing is that we had a story yesterday that there are three and a half million\nRegistered voters above the number of bodies in America have been about orders are three and a half million more registered voters then there are voters\n\nWhich means there's all kinds of voter fraud potential fraud taking but even those who thinks throw them out it doesn't\nIt doesn't cancel a fact of the Democrats have been losing elections left and right now we have they couldn't stop cabinet every October surprise if they tried to mount has blown up in their face and Elizabeth Warren is just the latest one and this one is a giant self immolation\nShe's making an abject herself to add insult to enter in injury Stormy Daniels defamation lawsuit of Trump has been thrown out the prostitute is going to pay Trump\nShe has been forced to

thinking could end up being the Democratic presidential nominee in twenty twenty\nI went through this yesterday there are some prominent Republican analysts to really think that it could have I mean boggles the mind\nIt's funny I went through this yesterday there are some prominent Republican analysts to really think that it could have boggles the mind but it's rooted in Trump hatred by the way it's\nThinking you have a lot it can be the Democrat nominee is rooted in being a never Trump or at any rate\nNo matter how you slice it\nIn real life on the ground however you want them to tournament determine reality of defined it just right at the Democratic party has not been winning elections and they have not been triumph thing in enterprise is they have\nUndertaken to persuade the American people to agree with them like Kevin all with Dr balls the Ford and now Elizabeth Warren make no mistake they misread this like you can't miss read anything I'm sure that Elizabeth Warren as the Democrats have told us to live with that she's doing this three weeks out from the terms\nDon't buy that they're ... they're limited as blowing up in their face this was one of many poker surprises these people have been\nWhat's the word\nAll rationality to the extent that they ever have any has been embraced Trump is driving them literally crazy they're acting talking behaving in ways so counterproductive they've lost their cool\nI'm sure that there are so obsessed so possessed Trump's hatred Trump's got to go that Elizabeth Warren I think probably the night before she released this news couldn't sleep\nSo excited I was gonna be the thing they got rid of Trump this was gonna be the thing that exposed Trump for the fraud that he is every journalist in America has gone to bed

that he's wrong he's a he's never seen a split like this he's talking about\nDemocrats winning the house Republicans winning the Senate\nHe is never seen anything like that you know I don't know how to do this\nAnd we consider it a toss up if it's forty percent one way or the other but I guess he's telling because he hasn't this idea what's going to happen this election and he's very nervous over the fact that he can't figure out he can analyze he doesn't have the slightest idea what's\nGoing to happen here now he didn't want to come out and say it that way you need to have the talent in the

we're in this weird zone where I don't remember we ever have is splitting the forecast life is pretty unusual yeah a lot\nOf things wrong usual this time aren't they need to be an unusual says two
