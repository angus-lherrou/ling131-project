the Glenn Beck river Hi\nHey pat and Steve Love you guys [laughter] uh I I think you're missing a very important point and that is that over ... identifies as Hispanic or therefore ... you must be bullied\nWow there's a great point here is again we're learning today yeah I forgot that was the standard how insensitive of\nUs mhm how hateful and dumber and ugly that is that we haven't spoken about how he does identify yeah and it must be a Hispanic\nJak ... it's interesting with that sort of talk it's like you know the the Elizabeth Warren is essentially identifying as Native American without real evidence that she is she getting beat up I mean this has been one of the biggest political disasters of all time\nHer coming out and trying to say that she actually is Hispanic Native American short approved it by going back ... generations trying to prove it one one thousand twenty fours yeah that's what made the left hates it through like this is this is playing into the worst of our\nUh beliefs about you know blood being the determining factor and these things and they they hate their\nThey have destroyed or over there she handled it terribly almost like one of those things I don't know maybe they should have leaked it through another source of the fact that she's associating herself with coming out and doing this is amazing ah but the identifying thing there's two parts of that\nLike I said as a you know say that you know the libertarian type thing right I don't care what people say they are right like it makes no difference to me if she says she's Native American or not I don't care but beyond that there's an actual truth\nYou know if it does all what's to come out and say she's black or Sean King what's to come out and say he's black when they're not black does that matter to me I don't care what they're doing there I think they're lying right and they're doing this for a reason but that doesn't mean it affects me in any way however we have\nAll sounds fantastic and these are obviously ... they're making yeah right like the point of\nAnd it's a fascinating thing from the left who thinks that you know we one of the biggest reasons Beto is you know in the public eye in the in the United states and not just the Texas figure is because of this video he made about it's ... it's a great idea to Neal or for the national anthem\nAnd what's behind that story people like Colin Kaepernick stating that black people are being unfairly accused without evidence and being shot at the streets for no reason because for for crimes they didn't commit\nAt the same time we're supposed to get on board if you're on the left are supposed to get on board with\n... with the with a new standard in which any white woman can accuse a man of rape and we're just supposed to believer\nThat is not going to work out well for African Americans or any ... any race of mail but this is the type of thing that makes no sense we never real cases of this this isn't a fake thing go back to you know we talked about till town because like the Emmett Till I mean this goes back a long way where black people were accused of doing terrible things to white people when they didn't\nAnd entire communities white and attacked the black person this is obviously going back quite a ways put it into something that legitimately as part of our history\nAnd it's surprising at least if liberals actually cared about black people and black men like they say that they do that they would want to embrace a standard like this to the point behind the at I think is is relatively fair and it's something that should be communicated I think to the the\nAfrican American community that ... that the criticism is perhaps a over done little overdone potentially the criticism here and interesting 'cause I don't think it's a\nIt's not it does not I don't know the the uh for sure on this but what I ... my understanding is that these are the people who are recorded this are African American that there's not like a white person doing a black voice quote unquote is you're African American or talking a and I guess the idea is that they have picked\nThe stereotypical African Americans to do the commercial it's very uncomfortable or I don't think that this is something that French she'll necessarily is bracing or by any means but it is a something that's\nMaking a lot of uh\nA lot of waves in the media because they're trying to make it seem like well this is just this Republican and who is a racist I mean hey he didn't have anything to do with the ad but besides that or is it it's an interesting double standards that we find ourselves dealing with the always\nYeah and and we get that double standard in a way to the tenth power and you know I guess we get kind of used to it by now I'm just sort of used to the double standard in to the point where you almost feel silly bringing out the double standard it happens so much\nIt is and it but it's so obvious sometimes you have to for example does anyone I mean if you don't live in French hills district you know French Hill is is that a major I actually don't yeah he's not a major national figure as a Congress a person\nUm so you know like I I think this wouldn't be a big national story it is a big national story today what is not a big national story is a name that almost everyone does Louis ...\nLouis Farrakhan is not a big national story today he's making no waves at all for his comments\nA yet again about Jews now this is a person who has met with you know people like a Keith Ellison\nHe has met with several congressman he's been embraced many times but even you know fairly recently uh people meeting with him we know the Iraq Obama at one point apparently had met with him we didn't find that out until like you out of office you know how the how that happens it's amazing but here's the latest from Louis Farrakhan\nRear Dava ... book\nIs a boost [noise]\nSo when they talk about ... Khan\nCall me I have to\nYou know they do\nCome in and these semi\nFed 'em and you turn my [noise]\nI don't know nothing about taking some body because of their religious preference\nOkay right yeah you know anything about hating somebody because of their religion really really you just you seemingly just called Jewish people termites yeah you don't know nothing about\nSaid more clearly than that the best what he's talking about another speeches wow a for pretty amazing it's to the other thing that ... that's interesting about Louis Farrakhan is nobody loves Louis Farrakhan more than Louis Irish or maybe this guy thinks he's really clever yeah every every arriving line\nHe's got this gigantic smile on his face like he's uncovered some deep historical truth [laughter] or or or or solved you know a perpetual motion machine and the guy is like he put\nEverybody in their place just now white slamming them down on ... I don't know nothing about hate no religious group\nKnown as I said I'm a turbine it like you think that's a yeah he does he's really excited about himself but he ... both of those words and in ... but [laughter] ... it was an ... should do it [laughter]\nNothing hanging around and he like I don't I don't have any scheduled schedule one we need a speech just for this long [laughter] how excited he loves when he delivers but [laughter] things are really up about it and I don't think he got the requisite\nReaction from the crowd and I think he wanted more of a you know a gas or I laugh or something you just kinda got a weight I don't know how to respond to that those kind of a bad state yeah I don't think I think he's going to be in trouble for that\nOr I'll give them is though that the words do ended up similar fashion they do that and something that he was able to do ha ha yeah might semi [laughter] so that's why that's why says that way our full powerful\nThat is something that he was able to do uh-huh yeah my semi [noise] so that's why that's why says that way our full powerful\n[laughter] it's really funny man like he did say he's still happy he looks so happy and you could live with the ... I Can't wait to deliver genocide above the Jews are just big smiles [laughter]\nAs long as they can come up with something that rhyme you know people have simple pleasures and I think that you know he got a couple of things he's asking for rhyming words and killing the Jews other than that yeah I just come on you know maybe a good cup of ice tea you know something something simple pleasures beyond that\nI mean he's he's he's said some pretty outrageous things that get very little coverage and this is another one um people just they seem to kind of ignore him and act like a he's not there supporting Democrats he's kind of not there you know at the very edge of the left\nA but\nIf anybody on the right again this is the double standard hadn't said anything approaching that ... uh about any ... can you imagine if somebody on the right had said something like that about Muslims would that be everywhere it would be everywhere are on the mainstream media\nUm but he for some reason kind of flies under the radar and gets away with all this stuff uh I mean he still hasn't really suffered any consequences from talking about killing Malcolm X.\nEven ... um when she pretty much ... once you pretty much admitted with this yeah\nAnd I do mama's no city if you come out\nToday and tomorrow [noise]\nNeither you [noise]\nBut if somebody had pets which is a [noise]\nEach one of the room here will become of kill and [noise]\nWe have a white man when you\n\n[noise] [noise] did you did you\nCome you train [noise] and you can train up business [noise]\nAmazing accident that almost an exact it mission uh-huh he murdered the week we killed ... is none of your business though we don't follow your white men law now wait\nNot murdering somebody is white and I hope that I Know I don't think it is either and by the way his Twitter account still active in case you were if you have a conservative recently had a\nCounter removed you can still get Lewis Lewis could still keep putting the posting these a live video\nThe Jewish term I think was posted on Twitter yeah I'm In and shut them down as an absolute Hitler son were talking about what this is Hitler stuff this is she at least a Third Reich stuff this is you know the architect of the third Reich Beto ... beers stuff\n[laughter]\nIt's just not right now of the [laughter]\nGetting deep deep down here [laughter] but I think it's important to point out business I met them Gary it is that is a that a mayor and the fact that he can to get away with it with no repercussions still no I mean like yeah the yes if you ask the Democrat\nOr eating publicly will you distance yourself from this guy up most of them will say yeah that will distance and stuff I have nothing to do with that\nThey will they will attempt that then you find pictures of them together right by like ... like Morocco bottomed out later ... but at least there at the point the only real repercussions this guy has as face for any of this anti Semitism\nThey want to get rid of Sean Hannity budget for the show their eyes\nHere in\nNinety seven was the\nArizona is more stimulating talk\nGoing back in the morning and more stimulating talk from the Ninety seven point one big soccer studios and always online at big talk radio dot com I mean all the Evan Williams\nAnd by Saturday sunshine most of the day the high fifty seven a clear skies I'd been increasing Pablo forty three coming up tomorrow that afternoon shower the high sixties in Prescott today mostly sunshine Seventy one fears in turning partly cloudy denied forty nine and an Oak Creek today plenty of sunshine I Seventy two star\nSeventy seven point one of the big Tucker is KBC K Katrina village Flagstaff Prescott Ninety seven point one the big talk to more stimulating taught [noise]\nThere are still a fair amount of work to be done I'm Dave Anthony Fox News that the secretary of state Pompeo said arriving in Mexico city for talks about the caravan of thousands of Central American migrants headed to the U.

pat gray unleashed\nA you know uh you can also get a Japanese podcast which we're gonna be talking to you you're a little bit um his podcasts of course is called chewing the fat\nWas with Jim Fisher which is I don't know that expression\nOh it was like I don't know you know we're talking about we're just now talk of the things over that [laughter] but you talk a little bit about the elections said today or this or this update is kind of fascinating\nUm I think if you want it to boil down quick version of where we stand at this very moment it looks very likely that the geo people hold the Senate it looks very likely that the few people will lose the house that you know because governors there was a bunch of stories there there's a lot of individual stories on both sides but if you're just going to summarize\nThat likely what we're looking at right now ... things can change as we know I don't know lock on either one of them I'm a think things can change in significant ways there's one thing that will not change however in this race which is the Democrats have found a way to milk there are people out of a lot\nOf money\nThe Democrats have found a way to milk there are people out of a lot\nOf money a lot of money\nNow this is of course the party that constantly tells us they want money out of politics they just they can't do it\nThey don't they do not want people buying elections they don't want to hold out and they constantly are out raising a Republicans in these big high profile races you know presidency and things like that ... famously\nAre outraged everybody in the universe and you know Donald Trump spent like nothing on his campaign twenty sixteen yeah it's a it's an under told story of that election Hillary the if the idea if it's true that you can buy elections Hillary Clinton absolutely would have won\nWhen she had way more money far more resources or because you know Donald Trump didn't\nThrow us a lot of his own money into the race it they just ran it on a shoestring for most much of the time and they were still able to win it kinda just proves every liberal theory about money in politics\n'cause he was kind of going on the theory that he didn't need anybody else's money so he didn't he sort of didn't try to fund raise much now I mean he ... he he raised some money and a little bit yeah and he used some of his own money but it wasn't like a billion dollars like she did know it wasn't even close um and this is that\nLike ... you know part of that is he's a big celebrity right like he was a celebrity before he was a candidate so he's able to get a lot of TV Time for free and and everybody was covering him all the time you could see now I mean even after he's president\nYou lose it let's say by eight or ten or seats you have a minority you might be able to get some stuff through in certain circumstances but it's going to be difficult and I think there's gonna be almost nothing they can get through\nAlmost nothing with the exception of maybe some bipartisan spending bills which they'll find ways to get those throughout I'm sure of it but\nOther than that you're going to get any real advantage not getting any tax stuff you're you're going to be tough times with any regulation you're going to get ... you know none of this stuff is going to be easy\nAs long as you keep running a massive deficit you'll get all those bills through yeah just keep spending money and they'll vote\nFor it yeah yeah it's not a problem to show you the house at how dramatic it is at least for the polls look and I know you're gonna say well the polls got the last thing wrong well some of it they got right a and a lot of it they got rights including the popular vote by the way which is what they were actually trying to predict in the national polls some of the staples were totally off though so we don't know whether this whole we're not sure\nBut right now the models are showing 'em there is a like a point one percent chance that the Democrats could pick up eighty three seats\nNow it's a point one percent chance to really unlikely like you say that that an absolute no it's not going to get to eighty three right ... ... the models are also showing there's a point one chance for Republicans to hold the same amount of seats they have now\nIt's that bad and environment the same same percentage chance the the crazy outlier possibility is democratic plus eighty three Republicans plus in zero\nWhat is the chance of not holding the same amount of seats by keeping the majority about twenty percent they're saying about uh twenty percent chance that can keep the majority right now while about about the same percentage chance that Democrats can get the Senate\n[laughter] so I mean ... look and if they get the house if ... if all the Democrats do is get the house they're going to be able to launch investigations like crazy right they're going to it's going to be a nightmare almost certainly impeach they ... right now will be convicted no no the one I Want a ... there's no chance of an ... infected unless something\nDramatic were to happen right because you'd have to get to sixty seven seats stuff better than I knew in sixty seven seats and are not gonna get anywhere close to that even if they get the majority in the Senate they're not going to be able to do that but they will have a subpoena power they will they will Bob down the administration in constant investigations and look investigating something that's real it's fine\nWhat they are going to do is not ... it's going to be ridiculous they're gonna investigate can be a nightmare you know there's a new story up today that Ivanka Trump may have committed a crime if you heard this no\nBecause when she was promoting the sale of real estate or in a when she was back in the day and you know doing her job was with the Trump Organization see she said things like\nWell this one's almost sold out and\nIt was not almost sold out like were they saying like our new building in a in in New York or you should get it now because it's almost sold out and in reality it was only like twenty percent sold out\nNow look there's a lot of guys are getting to be made right like you shouldn't say that because if someone's investing in Iraq didn't investigation and these wind up going bankrupt their humanity you joke it's happening [laughter] believe it I Believe there's a huge report that came out from a left wing media sources should be going on in New York has investigated him a bunch of times already\nThey're going to go after the house and the Senate if they get control of it will have launched investigation after investigation after investigation and nothing will\nHappen in this girl do an investigation as to why Donald Trump doesn't talk about his daughter Tiffany as much as he does the bunker investigation would act\nI wanted to see the results of that window I really don't know where they're from the uncommitted in anything there's people probably right now saying wait he has a daughter named Tiffany yeah yeah yeah and and that so that was from Marlon maples right I think so the only one from so it went viral\nHe has a daughter named Tiffany yeah yeah yeah and and that so that was from Marlon maples right I think so the only one from so it went Yvonne from what you've got a vodka and done junior and Eric right\nThen he got married to Marla Maples and it was just Tiffany and then and then this with ... with a lady money uh with Barron Barron yeah so what twelve or Thirteen now but we always hear about everybody else we

assessment of what this election\nIs about the main voting issue is not immigration or health care is is that the Democrats voting base is a bunch of nuts [noise] I Wish that were\nTrue I have tried to make that a fundamental issue in people's minds literal insanity the psychological disorders and I mean that's what every essence of my being I think much of the Democratic party agenda has derived from their voters being psychologically\nScrewed up\nThey are suffering psychological disorders because of things that have happened to them in their lives and they want to blame the country for it they want to blame the patriarch and they want to blame the founding\nBut then they they they claim that the only think sport is the government punishing the people that did whatever happened to these people\nAnd the Democratic party has embraced all of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities\nAnd try to normalize them all\nBy in training them as policy plants and the Democratic party platform if you will\nAnd that's how we ended up with people or represent two tenths of one percent of the population\nGiving a whole way of the Democrat Party thrown behind them to make their issue one in which the otherwise vast majority can end up being bullied into submission\nI have tried to ever ... even before but it's specifically the Kavanaugh hearings to make the point that that's what we're up against the that's what it's going to end up trying thing and women if the Democrats win the house all of that abnormality is going to achieve power at when they have the\nPower to actually implement their forms of punishment\nAgainst groups of people they blame for whatever is wrong in their lives these are not people that think that can fix things themselves they're not people that they've not been raised this way the Democrat Party does not promote that kind of thing in human behavior Democratic Party is happy\nTo help them blame others happy to make them think they have no hope that the deck\nIs stacked against them because of whatever their skin color or sexual orientation their their their gender identity\nTheir religion whatever Democratic Party is helpful in making all these people believe they're justified in thinking\nThat life is miserable because of all these horrible other people what they've done to them and then the Democrat Party let us fix it for you we'll become your champions will punish these people for you and the\nDemocratic voter basically yeah yeah yeah yeah now what you need to do is examine every Democrat constituency groups that they've been representing the last take your ... ten years twenty fifty and ask yourself if any of the people in those groups\nHave become happy have had\nTheir issues addressed and fix or are they as
