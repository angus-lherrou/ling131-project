tweeted over the weekend\nI'm so sick of those who want to blame this president for everything he didn't express sympathy or expressed it fast enough stop it there was a deep sickness taking root in this country and it spread here Twitter has become the white van covered indispensable bumper sticker\nOr listen to some of the responses the deep sickness stems from a man who mock sending flames hatred and bigotry is not the root cause but he's fanning the flames\nCaffeine or you two are you doing that as well is CNN is is anybody else in the media doing that is Twitter fanning the flames uh watches rallies and tell me how he leads us into a unified a nation\nI tell you what Allison in Kentucky I'm going to take her in a minute she was just that one of his rallies uh let's see oh Glenn are you going to do an anti Semitic attack on George Soros and I know how many have you done over the years none probably too many to count to ... no none\nBut oh yeah right Twitter is the problem will seem like it is because you don't have the facts\nAnd all you're doing is you are being a blowhard without any facts I'm not anti Semitic\n... ... were very quiet people but when you do cut to this rally and there there was just an energy that was there that you realized we can these there's hope for society\nYeah granted I got up and went to Walmart the next morning and people are cutting you off to get to the best parking spot you know like well yeah I don't know\n[laughter] Alison hang on the second I Want to get your copy of my book I I signed it I'll send it up to you thank you so much for holding thanks for I'm I'm sharing that it is that that is but maybe if I might struggling today\nDo feel like I'm struggling today 'cause I don't feel like I'm struggling to them I'm a little frustrated at ... and I would say yeah and I am able I'm frustrated that we concentrate on all the wrong things and I think that's kind of what you're saying here um let's see these aren't the things we should be concentrating on you know the the the president\nI'm being an anti Semite chief his daughter is Jewish\nThe ... you know how many Klan members are cool with that I I don't think any relatively few yeah how many how many Nazis were like oh you know what yeah okay so my daughter's gonna marry this Jewish guy she's got to become Jewish that's great that doesn't happen again\nWhen you're talking about uh American Jews one of the main things they've asked the president for for how many generations was to move the capital hacked to Jerusalem\nAnd if the guy that did it I mean he you know look it's insane it boils down to these ridiculous uh summaries of what a person believes are you telling me you can't criticize someone on the on the left\nThat you disagree with politically because they're Jewish because then you get called an anti Semite the same way like a liberal should be able to criticize without fear of being called a racist Clarence Thomas they should be able to say I think he's wrong on the on the constitution they should absolutely be able to do that without being called racist\nBut it does this bizarre thing and this is carried out today not by\nYou know the mother Jones in the Huffington Post read expected but every mainstream media source asking question after question after question what part of it gave me a percentage tell me please how much of this is Donald Trump's fault so here's let me let me do what Allison just said let's make a tangible\nHere is Joe Lieberman on a very frustrating interview with CNN listen to this\nWell it's just shocking moment I mean I we view it all through our own experience I I have had a life as a Jewish American which has been is not only free of anti Semitism\nBut I've had this opportunity to be elected senator from states Connecticut where the Jewish population is about to present and then oh lord gives me the chance to run for vice president first Jewish American on a national ticket\nA really an ... I ...\nA and forgive me for going back to the end of the ... election we actually got five hundred thousand more votes than the other ticket ... which was a reflection in numbers that people were voting are based on religion so when something like this happens\nIt's shocking and it changes that reality but I Believe the reality is that the American people are very fair minded not bigger than you saw it and the wholesome reaction of the neighbors who are not Jewish ... Pittsburgh and in the elected officials there it was very genuine\n... and of course this is not please yeah this is not what they want it out of Joe Lieberman they didn't bring him on to say that he had a good experience as an American you to bring him on to\nFake positive things they brought 'em onto to clarify exactly what portion of this is Donald Trump's fault\nTell us so we don't have to say it say he's responsible so we can have plausible deniability that that that this is exactly what we believe we don't want to come out and say five thousand times we'll just have to what you said okay\nIt's essentially the way they lead into this next question and again he is not giving them what what they want to hear some\n... that there are those who perceived those to be anti Semitic dog whistles when you see them at one of the closing ad campaign George Soros a Shannon yelling more Blankfein from Goldman Sachs with dark ominous pictures and talking about the money and the international banker question okay is that something that that sends a message\nAll the first thing I Want to see that in my opinion this brutal murderer in Pittsburgh really had to wear was committed by a hateful loner who was probably\nMore stimulated by a a anti Semitism in a social media to buy anything else going around um he ... he was against\nA President Trump but it's a real a real I I was glad to see that this website is taking it down a for a while and and all the social media people have to ask whether they're becoming vehicles for this kind of hatred but more generally I think all of us\nA half to ... beginning with the president democratic and Republican leaders in Congress people in the media conventional media and the more of an unconventional social media have to ask ourselves\nTo what extent are we contributing\nTo the division or in our society Charlie Dent that I work together in a group called No Labels trying to overcome the way the parties have become like worrying tribes but this goes beyond yet of ... and did the one that is a what would I say ... when the president makes a a sort of statement about unity\nOh let's presume for an urge them to build on it and think about ways in which a he can act so that no one can ever say a he somehow was responsible for violence or or hatred again it's a\nThe the Joe Lieberman forty seven minute response ah but I mean you get the summary there I mean first of all this guy was not pro Trump\nNot I mean he was ...\nA ... the Joe Lieberman forty seven minute response ah but I mean you get the summary there I mean first of all this guy was not pro Trump\nNot I mean he was ... viscerally\nAnti Trump in a way of he you know what I don't like about Donald Trump is he's too nice to Jews that is essentially what the guy was saying on\nSocial network over and over and over and over again so he was not a pro Trump guy that shot up this or the synagogue\nA and you know like it's important to make that distinction and how do you bring people together the exact opposite of what CNN trying to do in that clip ... I mean without that we're just at the nicest Joe Lieberman possible way right but what are you saying is what you're doing right now\nBy trying to make it into a situation where Trump is blamed what we should do is wrong what we should do instead is when he said something that we think helps the environment we should praised it sure certainly generally speaking we have an issue with our discourse I think I think almost everybody would agree with that um but when it comes to the shooting it's not related\nRight so here's what the media should have done this weekend the media should have said okay so what role does rhetoric\nOn social media and from the president to and from the press and everything else what role does media play in\nIn the life of a guy who as we saw\nThis non white male um ... tried to commit with a with a pipe bombs\nThe guy was nuts the guy was absolutely nuts he was a loner she had finally found a cause that he could you know rallied behind she you know was not he was nuts okay\nSo that one what role does politics play does the media play do politicians play in whining people up\nThat's a viable ask a question on that particular topic and not just about Trump but the whole thing\n... ... what role does the media play what about Twitter what about Facebook what's winding some of these people up what happens in the future\nK valid\nThe shooting in Pittsburgh\nHere's how they should have covered this\nThis guy was a anti Semite who this clearly had nothing to do with politics the guy he hated Donald Trump this is just a loner just like the guy in the van and he had no friends he had no friends\nShe was a sick twisted guy\nWhat is the whole in America why are we seeing this now because it it's not Donald Trump and it's not for rock Obama ... right there's something fundamentally missing here what is it\nWhy are we changing why are kids killing themselves at a record rate there is a bigger\nIssue here than politics but nobody in the media wants to address it because nobody in the media and nobody in politics can win\n[noise]\nBy the way we're doing a episode tonight on what happened in Brazil and the candidate in Brazil\nAnd why does

your Democrats are demanding a Trump told it now did you love it when Trump said I have sounded down if you only told it back up I Will\nDonald Trump was elected to be different\nDonald Trump was elected because people were fed up\nWith politics as usual I must tell you this people fed up with politics see the Democrats in the media politicizing everything it's not going to send people running for the Democratic party quite the opposite of what the media thanks to the media and the\nDemocrats obviously think that a majority of the American people want to see the country the way the Democrats do throughout the lens of everything being political\nAnd people don't want to see it that way the Democrats in the media telling Trump to tone it down\nBut they tone nothing down themselves

spoil hill and the first question\nA drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws\nBy the way I Need it tells you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things\nAn anti Semitism they think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd tell you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump as an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway\nThe reporters as Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws this\nTo do with it if you take a lucky if they had protection inside\nAs a result would have been\nThe
