social media that\n... is thinking this way they're not\nDavid has a David Barton is with us he has a book out called this precarious moment\nUh he's written that with the James Carlo was a just a great great guy and good thinker 'em and they have the stats and the book and they have different things we've ... we were concentrating just for a second on millennials because I Know David is seen it and I've seen it because we're doing it with mercury one\nAnd when you present the facts to millennials if you're not trying to when they say wait a minute what David talk about a few of the millennials we've had in for our two week you know training course and they have actually come\nA little hostile sense right yeah we have a number of Columbus skeptics are here to disapprove of ... that were all wrong and\nIt's All right you know we don't we don't run from that situation would you address them and say look up a conversation as long as I can gauge and the Congress right and so we start asking them questions and you know they have their opinions but we just ask them questions and it's kind of like they sit back and uh I don't know\nAnd so what you ask the questions that lead them to affirmation\nIt's amazing to see that they didn't take those questions or go back to those that taught them and change the we literally we have a girl that came in that you know learned all sorts of stuff she went back to her professor started asking her professor questions he got all befuddled because he didn't know the answers\nHe now has asked her to meet with him once a week and teach teach him what she learned and and all these classes easing it's amazing\nAnd and she said she wrote a report and he said you are either a liar and you're going to get an ass\nOr this is the best paper see me in my office that's right and she he said okay I Want to talk to you about your sources and she had him nailed down 'cause she had never here's a professor but didn't know this stuff\nAn economics professor and he found out that founding father John Witherspoon had the greatest impact of any person in American history and American economics and he didn't know that and she showed him that and then show them the documentation\nAnd he said okay I I Want more because I clearly but that's the thing of asking questions with relationships and we take these these guys that come in hostile or otherwise\nAnd just because of relationships but ... and as we tell them we have a lot of fun with them and quite frankly we tell them that sarcasm so love language if we don't make fun of us because we don't like you know I think this is the so you know we we we can and joke and they have a great great time\nBut they come out transform and there's some of the most mature individuals and these these guys are all\nIt's in their mind to become leaders and I tell you they are so so good and it's just amazing\nWe were at a meeting in February and we I don't think I've and now it's this formally uh may I may go for a ... we are going to do black history month a museum here at our studios in February\nIf you don't think that's\nA little controversial um but we have worked on this and we're working on it with the Lincoln museum and uh it's going to be a little mind blowing and really really eye opening to a lot of people on both sides\nUh and it's black history but you know not all the black history that everybody knows let's tell the black history that really nobody knows\nA and that is going to be here at our studios in the month of February and yesterday we decided that because they're they're gonna we're gonna have do since we're gonna have people\nHow I found it fascinating in the book that we have\nArgued as if these things were not settled long ago and we have argued a common language how dare you insist as if this was just some idea that a bunch of racist had\nThere been Franklin is a great example because Ben Franklin talked about how somebody Germans are moving in Pennsylvania and they were\nAnd he said the problem is they're speaking their own language there started to create signs in German their truck started to create documents in German you can't have a nation if you don't speak the same language so Franklin was one of the first one south and Thomas Jefferson the same thing\nHe said we have immigrants coming in which is right and by the way they were so pro immigration than the declaration of independence one of the twenty seven grievances was were separated from Great Britain because he's trying to stop immigration we won't immigration\nIt's just we wanted a simulation with immigration they were huge pro immigration\nGift simulation I mean ... was that he was Thomas Jefferson they will bring with them the principles of the government they leave him by with their own early you involved in the early youth\nThese old principles with their language they will transmit to their children the proportion to their numbers they will share with us in legislation they will infused into their old spirit warp and biased it's directions and render it uh as heterogeneous incoherent and distracted mass\nHe says the solution is thought better to discourage their settling together in large masses and they should distribute themselves sparsely among the native for a quick or assimilation this goes\nIt seems to me necessary this is Frank Clinton seems to be necessary\nTo distribute the um the Germans the Germans a more equally mix them in with English established English schools that are now where they are now too sick we settled\nI Am against the it I Am not against the admission of Germans in general for they have virtues their industry for ... the great farmers\nHe's just saying we have to get them to be American this is the opposite\nOf what we're doing no Dearborn, Michigan I mean we we want people to simulate and we don't want them creating a parallel culture\nWhere almost a no go zone now for for police Somalians in in um Minnesota exactly and we've got groups in West Texas creating their own separate communities and that's not it it's assimilation you want to become an American you don't come to America to take over and move to whatever your country was\nYou come here to be an American now that's where the professors the elite groups really are into all America's really bad ... you know we need we need to be like Europe or whatever\nOne way to lose it is is to not pay attention to what they did and one of the things we try to do in the book is we don't we're not into government solutions we tried to give things that every single individual can do because America gets healthy from the bottom up not the top down\nYou say that racial healing is fairly easy all we have to do is do it ... what what what is the plan for racial healing\nYou know that there are several things one is you got to change some of your knowledge basis or find with millennials they are taught about race from the way the professor said and we shut them seven things that everyone needs to know about race and generally they don't their historical but\nRemember off the top of your head with those are oh yeah there are several things of this the first permanent ... permanent slavery was introduced in America by black man Anthony Johnson who sued ... own other black men\nAre we show the fact that a ... forty three percent a free blacks in South Carolina on black slaves that wow one out of it yeah nearly half\nA one out of eight a Native Americans on black slaves and and major tribes\nAnd that didn't stop that events and even though they may have to Beijing proclamation when did\nSlavery ... didn't stop with Thirteen to ... when we abolish slavery because we only bothers flavor in the United states but Indian nations are their own nations that right now about when they stopped it was years later it was probably a decade later\nBefore slavery stopped in Indian nations so what we do show slavery as a human problem it is not a black white problem despite what your professors say it is a problem and the way you view humankind so we go through and and show for example Tim Scott and James Lankford in the U.S Senate have come up with with\nThis thing where you invite other people from other races to come eat a meal with you on Sunday come into your house and you know learning in touch you don't solve racism institutionally you saw that one person at a time change in a hard time seeing people different and not having this black white polarization that we often try to make today how worried are you\nDavid about the level of anger now\nLevel the anger is a real problem but what it what is derived from is is the bigger problem and the stereotypes and and and all these things we really don't know each other\nAnd once you get to know each other and what you did this inter relational stuff like with millennials some unlikely folks of other races and other groups once you start doing individual stuff that's where it breaks down\nAnd that's where you're able to demonstrate that you know what you thought about may or what you thought about this group is not accurate were individuals were made in God's image we have equality and we can get along great if all sit down and talk to what you're doing to your book Len I'm\nAn addict it outraged ... that's exactly it you you sit down and have conversations on bigger things\nSo real quick just one last give me the six things\nThat you say are these are the six urgent steps\nTo sit there actually six searching areas what we've got to do an immigration what we have to do in our relationship with Israel what we have to do with millennials what we have to do with the people of faith doing a terrible job right now is when people of faith or so we go through those six areas and\nLet me lose touch on Israel our relationship with Israel is pretty good year there's learnt now your concern in the book about Christians are starting to become anti Semitic\nThey are becoming anti Semitic what has changed is the last well we don't know the scriptures well anymore and that we have the highest level of biblical literacy of any generation American history\nAnd so we're ah we're seeing sixteen hundred anti Israel events a year on college campuses uh people don't know much about the Palestinians but they're told they're oppressed people in Israel is doing it\nSo we have a real individual turn against Israel and a lot of denominations are coming out against Israel denominations that used to be very pro Israel now you only yes absolutely absolutely yeah\nThis is a more liberal churches though their\n... their water called mainstream the nomination so that that you know it's kind of like the United Methodist Church usa those so they had never been anti Israel before but now they are they're they're coming out and the one in due to BBS kind of stuff to boycott the messenger and sanctions\nSo there is a growing anti Semitic movement among people of faith in America which is certainly a problem now this administration is in great job on restoring is just as if an absolutely amazed yeah but that doesn't solve the individual problem is we have a college campuses and at churches and people of faith\nDavid Barton and James Carlo the name of the book

[noise]\nAnd it was just talking about memory but let's talk about another thing that is a misunderstood or underutilized [noise]\nYou know are gone last forgotten\nIn American that's bravery I have no idea what Malcolm Gladwell political bent is I don't really care um I like him I think he's smart what he votes for I don't care I'm he could be conservative we could be liberal bill no again don't care\nBut let's let's just say maybe he's liberal maybe fifty fifty shot\nHe just came on this program\nHe talked to me about a portion of the Kavanaugh hearings with out expressing either condemnation or support he spoke about memory and how it applies to both Kavanaugh and ...\nYou know how dangerous that is for him but if you were on the Glenn Beck program strike one you talk to him about Kavanaugh strike too you didn't say an opinion on Capitol strike three you're out yeah I mean any whether what regardless of his personal politics a lot of listeners would be from the left um and so\nYou know but that's like but he doesn't care well you're the care it's something that we need it is it something that we need people just being willing to be honest and and just talk about talk about what\nWe we can talk about things without making everything about politics\nEven though this story the reason why I had him on\nIs because it's very ... today but that he did the podcast before Kavanaugh yeah nothing to do have nothing to do with it so we can we talk now in light of this can we just talk about what you found on memory right because it's important and it's the reason why I honestly I Would listen\nTo him on Brian Williams yes because he's credible if you're a soul mat out came out and I understood jealous or did that I wouldn't\nYou know it didn't ever but like Malcolm so credible because he's not doing he actually looking for an answer right yeah and that's what I think it is so absent in so many places right now I mean it's a you know it's it you don't oh wait you're not always right um but\nIt's okay to keep your principles and and maintain your arguments and and believe things are morally correct the way you do but there is no reason why you can't entertain it'd be challenged by someone who has a different opinion I I feel like that's what you know one of the things that's been interesting about the cabinet thing is because the those on the left\nHere and you know the prominent ones in the left have been so\nI mean I Want to use the technical term bonkers on the story so over the top so ridiculous in so many ways\n[noise] um it had taken it has increased you know enthusiasm for Republicans which will be something you'd expect but it's also taking people who are already planning to vote and changing their minds towards capital\nBut this guy comes out and goes against Kavanaugh with this is my other ridiculous of an of a nonsensical situation surrounding\nHow can you let this guy go back to the Senate\nAh thanks gave I mean I I just made a book out to you I'm going to send it to you addicted outrage will pop it in the mail today real quickly let me go to Eddie and South Carolina then pappy your pets here from the past gray

name play laugh the room he said I was in senator Feinstein's office when she got out of four letter\n[laughter] yes the pretty ... they're All right\nOkay so did he know about the letter to\nYeah I I mean etiquette is really clear I thank you for your phone call um and it's kind of like talking to Lindsey Graham is I'm a ... you know it's obvious that this leak came from somebody I personally think\nThe the you know the the authorities should we should look into the leak I think it's really rotten what ah what happened to Ford\nPat\nWelcome to the program thank you good you know you hear it really it it is it really is you and I we can just say that no and you can't think of any other place 'cause you know that I'd rather be yeah no so your experience with Kavanaugh because we went into this last night on the news\nAnd why it matters if you if you miss last night's broadcast the news and why it matters you should listen to it\nBecause uh I was quite an expos they\nReally do nights ago I Believe certainly regulations go before last night before last starting ... ... ... and you notice the president were picked up I Know I Know I went to yeah they don't they don't care yeah a when this happened to\nParticularly men Brian can then men on the right right they don't care they don't care and uh I'm not going to go into it here but you were there were there I was you know it I was there so well we live very near\nA Yale for three years and I went to ... you went to Yale yeah so um ... Kavanaugh and I distinctly remember\nYeah oh I don't even want to bring it yeah don't even I wouldn't have\nJuly I have a a a fan in my\nUh bathrooms you know when you turn on the light of my bathrooms I have a fan there yeah every everybody because of of that memory but anyway so [laughter] so what are you really yeah I'm ... so uh so it was just code\nSo [laughter] so [laughter] so I'm\nPat what's on your mind is that a well of course Kevin ... is on my mind\nWell you might never far from my thought here and uh and\nUh I it's it's fascinating to see how are you know just kind of outlined how the Democrats\nWanted investigation got one wanted it expanded still got a ... a wanted it delayed so it was and now now that it's all been done and we're wrapping up and they found nothing now they want even more investigation and when would this ever end\nI think in two thousand twenty is when it when if you if you are you let him continue this process but ah\nThe latest thing from the roommate who knows who knows for a fact that cabinet was lying about his drinking habits and those words in his year book\nIn high school ... do bring them up uh I don't run don't bring up the word no do booth do so it's by and devil's triangle don't do it 'cause you know what those are about obviously ... they're a well at least his roommate knows that\nThey were a sexually charged words ... which would make a huge difference in whether he should be a Supreme Court justice forty years later if he was messing\nTerms that were about ... he asked the Supreme Court and ... then it's OK yeah as a teenager right as a teenager teenagers don't do that not only the networks reckless heinous serial killers that usually start to show signs of serial killing ... around sixty\nYeah that's usually what happens most serial killers or oh I think we talked about this the other day do you guys are you familiar with the word moved\n'cause yeah I've heard of a million or with a myth yeah pretty widely understood to be flatulent just it's interesting ... three of us off is a different thing yeah all three of us had enough uh recollections of what that word meant India might actually was the sexual use I remember was that both yeah or boss\nBoth buff I think both I think it's both would be really kind\nOf okay and what isn't but like Glenn had a a drug reference yeah and I thought maybe I'm wrong\nBut I looked it up and you're you're a bigger area and it is it's also a drug reference and then pat ... yeah was the farting thing yeah which is amazing I mean I honestly when I read that I was like a he's probably trying to cover for himself because in my thought that is actually what it was it was like a sexual term but\nThen I ... I mean we all three of us yeah people have different recollection of a different area yet right different schools where a different backgrounds different you know I mean like that so it could mean anything really good they're not going to try and really I never heard of I don't know what that it yeah I don't know what that is well let me explain [laughter]\nAh but the way the way everybody cares about this stuff when and I think you guys mentioned the certainly in the show when there was a president who admitted to far worse than this stuff\nNo nor worse than we don't have it on tape and if we did have it on tape gonna lay it right now\nI think I was a thug [noise] for a for a big part of my growing up I ... I ... I was I think that was a very typical\nUh uh uh getting rapists areas a mischievous child as as a young for\nHousing 'em by the time I was an adolescent and moved back from Indonesia and was struggling with these issues or racial identity being a father not being in a way what strong racially Tennessee I think that a ... you know I reacted by\nA by engaging and a lot of a a ... that's not a typical mhm white males\nAcross the country the way that\nI have a lot of basketball ... black male or buy a ...\nDidn't take school that's serious like Watchmen them that's what ... what kind of fights why was to play a black a black male rank drag rain or he drank totally different than white who are consumed\nSubstances that aren't where do we were legal yeah not a legal\nUm uh and I think generally pretty away it was a yeah acting out out in a way as a way so that when I look back on it I understand uh you know what I used to what got me through those years was was a [laughter]\nA natural aptitude for ... a man that I didn't pay attention too much to be able to my grades I was writing okay\nHe goes on to say I think you know it takes too long [laughter] he goes on to say that he would drink a six pack in the hour before class yeah and in and out on a soapbox but I don't go to the last drunk yeah I mean nobody cared about that stuff\nNo no and you don't want to do about it and by the way where was that stuff when he was running where was that right where what we have to we have to have an ... calendars uh-huh but uh this guy has that the press\nNever did it and no one in the press and they would be a right\nTo not do it would would hear that and say oh well he ... he's looking at you look at his temperament I mean he was right he admitted to fights he admitted to fights he admitted to chugging beers we didn't like him in an illegal activity his temperament\nThey would've never said dad and which is more important\nHe's there's only one executive cabinet I was doing for a position where he's won ninth of the court so far more important for the one guy you know to be able\nTo have that disposition to be able to have that temperament and be able to have that judge ... here's why\nHere's why mhm because he's not white and he's fighting the patriarchy\nThat is the real reason why it does matter yeah if you're fighting the patriarchy and the white and the history of colonialism and I know this sounds ridiculous but read the book\nIt's post modernism if you are doing that did you see the did you see the the um the the bogus studies they were just

after rush Ninety seven point one of the top [noise]\n\n\nAn NPR reporter uh just [noise] just tweeted that Senate Judiciary committee Democrats are filing out a Chuck Schumer his office stone\nFaced the meaning is they're coming out then they they're depressed uh there are no expressions on their faces they're not happy in a stone faced their shell shocked there's something or other\nNow why would that be why well did the Democrats on that committee\n\nActually believe Christine Ford did they really believe what she was saying I don't know how anybody could\nHonestly Fox without an I I'm not even being part is when I say this she can't remember where when why the people she says we're there weren't there and yet these Democrats although it did the Democrats and that can be really think that an FBI investigation of another five or six days\nWas going to somehow produced corroborating evidence that would wipe out the cabinet nominations\nThey really thought that because my my thinking all along has been they know that there's nothing other than the ... this is all this this man it's all they've got if they really thought\nThat this FBI investigation was going to find something that six previous investigations and countless other interviews and written questions having produced\nWell that is shocking honest to God I Know I Know I'm I'm sometimes naive but I fought this has been a scam\nFrom the get go and that they're all in on the scam and at the scammer was delay hence the late release of of of Dr Ford's letter detailing all of this so they walk out of ... office and they're all stone faced\nWe all know that the president cannot lead us through the time\nWe know that he's disposition only unable to restrain his impulse to divide us his mockery of Dr Ford last night in Mississippi was wrong\nBut it doesn't really surprise anyone who is\nMr ... senator Sasse I have an alternative view and are not going to presume that you are listening but maybe somebody who knows you\nIs I Need you to consider something senators asked\nYou and numerous other say that President Trump mock Dr Ford in his rally south haven Mississippi earlier this week and then you suggested that the Trump knows what he's doing despite all the criticism he gets\nThat he is doing this is who he is he can't help it\nJust ... I think it's the other way around I think Trump knows exactly what he's doing I think Trump has\nA behavioral patterns strategically happens it's called pacing and when he briefly explaining it again in setting up what's to come next\nWhen President Trump originally spoke about Dr Ford why did he say compelling testimony reinventing he couldn't turn away from it if she's telling the truth Kavanaugh's God he's got no prayer if Kavanaugh's ally ... gone Trump said all of this and everybody so wow this is really unusual for\n... no it's not unusual Trump gets himself on record\nNot every time but in many issues he gets himself on record in the approve the Washington establishment way and every time he does it do not some of you panic maybe you don't have any more\nBut when he first started doing this light Paris climate accord yeah yeah there may be something here we're going to look at it they don't always going to vote no doesn't matter you can remember countless times where the president's initial statement on an issue seemed to dovetail with what the swamp things\nBut then a few days or are we go by him and the president's becomes who he is and he starts speaking out against it after he's put himself on the record he does this for credibility and he does it in something called pacing\nAnd it relaxes the opposition\nIn any number of ways she's doing the same thing here with Dr Ford he know right off the bat that she was saying things that nobody could corroborate that nobody can prove that she couldn't prove and what he did on Monday Night was not mock her\n\nHe explained it to everybody\nThe truth about her\nEverybody because of what Trump did at that rally everybody was forced to look and listen to that little\nRiff on Dr forge shaky uncorroborated I'm provable test them on to the drive by it's we're never gonna\nTell the truth about Dr Ford the drive buys were not able to ignore the rally they tried not even Fox televised Trump's rally but because he said what he said about her he forced the drive biased to cover what he said\nIn the process the drive buys reported what he said and people like Ben Sasse another started giving the vapors give it a vapor who am I got Trump is always uses horrible because it isn't humane he's not fit\nWhat Donald Trump did re counting\nThe absurd inconsistencies in her testimony Donald Trump calling her out on everything has been play now on all media when all day yesterday\n\nReporters are now asking senators and the press secretary questions about it in the press briefing yesterday\n\nThe fact is the drive by media did not report the inaccuracies of Dr forge testimony the drive by media did not report on on none of the cooperation being possible they did not tell their audiences that's the four people foreign place\nIn the room with her incident happened claim they weren't there nobody knows that folks\nOther than you but people watch the mainstream media had no idea but Dr Ford couldn't backup what she was saying that people watch the mainstream media had no idea\nThat the former witnesses foreign claims were there all deny it and don't remember being there and one of them was one of our good friends\nDrive by it's we're not reporting in the bathroom Dr buys were reporting what the Democrats senators I Believe her she is a credible witness as far as the American people who watch only mainstream media is concerned a woman was telling the truth the head back up she had cooperation and capital\nWas guilty so Trump goes out tells the truth about her\nShe doesn't know what she doesn't know when she doesn't know where she doesn't she got home she gets in on the record the drive by half to report it and for the first time in their lives people who watch mainstream media actually heard it look at it this way thinking for the millions of people who had never heard the truth\nAbout Dr Christine's Ford and her full of holes testimony think of a million just never heard of until\nTrump went out and characterize that for everybody think of it this way\nThink of the thousands of voters in Missouri in\nArizona in Michigan and man and West Virginia North Dakota Alaska who now know the truth who never would've known the truth had Trump or not\nDetailed it for people in his rally\n\nCollins mansion Heitkamp McCaskill flake Murkowski they knew\nThat there was no collaboration they knew that there couldn't have been any truth to what she was saying by virtue of witnesses this is why Trump did it this is why Trump does what he does if we had an honest media\nMillions of people were already know that Dr Ford story doesn't add up\n\nIf the media ever told the truth about this there wouldn't be any protests today are not nearly as large envelope\nIn voluminous the people these protests thinks she's telling the God's truth they think it's gospel\nThey don't know that her story can't be backed up their media hasn't told him the Democrats senators haven't told them only Trump did another reason why they hate him\n\nBut we don't have an honest media and sold millions of people had no idea\nOf all the holes in the Christine balls the Ford story\nNow they do and here's a little cherry on top since Trump did that\nAnd the whole media reported on it and Democratic senators and the like we're asked about it what comes three days later today's f._b._i. report saying\nNo cooperation for what Dr Ford\nSaid so Trump says that\nPeople like Ben Sasse another number Trump or his goal literally in saying\nThat if Trump hadn't set it nobody would know what the Trump didn't say it millions now do know and here comes the cherry on the top the FBI report\nWe couldn't find any cooperation for her story end of the week Trump was right\nDrive by media wrong Democrats senators wrong Ben Sasse wrong\n\nAnd Trump doesn't do this accidentally it's not like he's lucky and stumbled into this stuff this is Trump strategy and it's all related to the pacing\nOf how he originally or initially eventually I should say gets to his real thoughts on any issue brief time out now back with more in a\nSense we humans Russia always loved music on the voice\n[noise]\nI'm ... and this is the ... stock market report civil wealth management and investment banking\nElectric here was senior strategist Jason are Laskey Jason kind of a flurry of economic data coming in today that's really influencing the markets\nI thought yeah another busy day in the markets are first on the economic front initial jobless claims for the end of September as well as continuing claims for the third week of the month reported this morning both numbers came in lower than expected and continues the story from yesterday's ATP employment report that we discussed in the broadcast the numbers lead up to the unemployment gauge for September that will be reported tomorrow morning\nThe expectation is that the employment rate will dropped three point eight percent\nThis would rival some of the low numbers that we saw back all the way the Nineteen sixties early night state's economy and this will be another positive sign for the economy will also giving the Federal Reserve comfort to continue their gradual rate increase\nOn that note the ten year treasury reached a high up three point to three percent this morning as since backed off in early trading now this is the highest level since two thousand eleven that we've seen on the ten year\nThis rise on the heels of comments from fed chair Powell\nThat he expects the gradual rate rise to continue and at some point in the future you would not be surprised if the fed were to rein in growth for the economy now chairman Powell made it very clear that the fed was quite a ways away from the stance but just that notion is move the rates significantly this morning last the equity markets are often early trading as another potential data breach has been identified", "year": "2018",
