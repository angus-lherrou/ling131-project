right there in the you know in the in the lantern there's an opening right\nThere right and I think I Would make the same point whiz with the cloth device first of all cloth does not seem difficult to penetrate but secondly there is an opening for the eyes I mean the the genie could just go\nAnd go right through there to get into the head\nOf the person right now they do I mean just from a pragmatic now the perspective you just go right through there as long as you're wearing gloves a full body you know are covering\nAnd then your head is wrapped and you're just have the eyes\nNow your eyes can be used to a a lower a man or even just the if the eyes if you look at him and just write you can say you know it's not like you know look how they're dressed it's look how they were looking at me or on her and so you can uh\nYou know you can be\nBe which if you will play out by a woman's eyes I think even in this in lightened me to era we can all come together and say if a woman looks at you you know what are you going to do right\nExactly I mean you know exactly right it's just there's virtually if she's been possessed by a gym [laughter] I mean you know this is the thing\nWe were talking about this off the air a little bit because you know Donald Trump used the word nationalist yesterday when we're talking about nationalism and what the definition of nationalism in history is is at times very disturbing lane\nHowever you know I don't know I'm sure that that obviously no one is citing\nThe really bad examples of nationalism as it as where we're trying to go if you're Donald Trump or not saying oh we want to be like those terrible countries he seems to be referring to it as like look we're the best country and we were routed and we have a great the best you know culture and went and we should be\nA patriotic and and and be a you know sure excited about that but when you talk like this that when you\nWhen you play a clip like that it's hard to kind of argue that we don't have a superior culture and a lot of ways\nYou know like I kind of saying that because you've probably been possessed by a gym or cool\nThis is the gym tolerated and now it's a different kind of June threat was founded I've had a lot of\nOf\n... or in my life I got to say this trouble yeah it it it gets you into job believe it in the ... of it all adds up ...\nWhat do you think is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be here and you have to chase them around and process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who were coming up way worse for America can\nYou have ... you're you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in at entry point\nAnd to turn them away right there it's an invasion treated as an invasion turn way\nYou see this as an invading force these people they're not going to literally\nNow the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is an invasion invasion\nForce and how can we turn these poor people away\nAnd I want you to listen to all of the people on television that are now saying\nWe are a country that is always had open arms to migrants we're always the country that I mean our our values or have always our greatest strength is our tolerance and are welcoming spirit\nReally is coming from the left because I've always felt\nThat way but you always told me that we have a rape culture not a tolerance culture\n... ... ... ... I've always thought we welcomed\nImmigrants in but ... you'll always told us that we have anything that is foreign\nI've always believed that our our laws reflected a nation of immigrants but you have always said that our laws are racist and a half from the beginning bend a system of oppression\nSo which is it which is it how can you\nTell me that we've always been a country that is welcoming immigrants\nAnd our laws are set up as a nation of immigrants\nAnd yet tell me that we are the most depressive monstrous society ever that only embraces a rape culture\nYou can't have it both ways which are we\nAre we a are we a\nCountry that is that embraces a a rape\nCulture or as or as any rational\nNon Marxist post modernist might say or are we a little of\nBoth are we are we\nA country that tries to be this way and sometimes we fail to see you can't really say that because then you can throw the baby and the bath water out\nWhich is why we've been saying hey baby is a good thing the bath water may need to be changed but let's not throw the baby out too and that's not been your argument\nThe radicals those who don't believe in\nAny kind of border security at all your the one leading the charge that we do all this land\nThis land doesn't belong to us\nThat were all afraid because we're white people and white people are bad\nAnd now you're on TV saying\nThat we've always had this culture that welcomes immigrants\nWell see [noise] um\nIt is true we've always had a culture that has welcomed immigrants we are a nation of immigrants but we have also felt that you've always needed to come here and not want to dismantle us\nThat you came here because [noise] because you saw the American dream\nAnd most immigrants do most immigrants\nSee the American dream and they've come from someplace else you notice these guys are coming from Honduras they're not stopping in Mexico why they would probably have an easier life in Mexico just blending in they speak the language why why would you come to America and why not just walked through America\nTo Canada they've got free health care\nThinking that\nThey have all kinds of his anti hate laws and speech laws\nThere a progressive utopia they have free universal healthcare why not just marched through us and go to Canada because one of two things either Canada is not the beacon\nAmerica is for all those who are the poor and the tired and the huddled masses\nOr this is a political move\nAs you're not going to Canada because it's not about you your life the job\nIf the political move it's to destabilize\nTo help push a country over the edge\nNow I don't know which one it is\nBut I Do know this Seventy five hundred people coming across our border in mass is not helpful\nAnd shouldn't happen you lose control of your borders let me ask you this if all of a sudden planes just started taking over DFW or the airport in your area all of a sudden\nPlanes just started taking over DFW or

wait a minute wait a minute what are you doing can't land here can't land here would you be okay with it\nOr would you think that might cause chaos and might be dangerous what'd you think that if Sea Tac airport cannot control the skies if they lose control of their airport they're not really an airport\nWhy does that work for an airport but it doesn't work for a country we lose control of our borders\nAnd people are just coming whenever they want and they can just get a big huge mass of people because they're Seventy five hundred people can do it surely they could get twenty thousand and

I guess her tone wasn't acceptable to Alyssa\nOr but I mean you know she has a very fair question since the woman who is supporting an ideology in a movement that is a brutal to women all over the world\nMuch worse than uh the certainly much worse than what you know these and sorry did or Louis C K did or in or the founders or or\nThe [laughter] All right around hers were so oppressive really have you seen surreal law yeah it's\nNot not good ah so I mean I just it's a totally fair question and the fact that they continue to embrace when to start stories the guards say it you know once you bring to the table you know she's just the I guess you just crossed that line if you're gonna be radical and you'll stand up and you'll keep saying radical thing they will embrace you no matter what remember\nWe did something years and years ago about why the\nUm the SARS sewers and the key thousands were brought into the movement a and it was a decision to make sure you didn't lose the Islamic vote in the future so they went out and they found it I'm not saying that those two but they went out and they found\nYou know connections to the Islamic community and brought them in and gave them positions are inside to make sure that we we lock up the Islamic vote and so that's at least how they got in is they were saying\nWell we have to have a broad chance we have to have a very big tent no no you really know now is people who are ...\nYeah no I don't think you're outside the tent ... really comes down to the media has not held the movement accountable remembers is someone who uh you know and I because there's so many victims of really terrible things sometimes that occurs but it's more than that if ideology you know and one of the founders of the me too movement\nOr what has shown that she also had a accusations against her from\nMe and she did sleep with a very young cast made in one of her movies she was dating a Anthony Bourdain we now know obviously killed himself later on but with at the time uh CNN employee paying off the person who's making the accusation I think that\nI mean it's amazing to me that no one has said\nThat that contributes to his death I I've had the same thought\nI mean it's you know in you know look suicide is unreasonable so you're not in your mind when you commit suicide but there are things\nThat um that that can be sold\nDisjointed in your head that you can never solve them you can never repair them if if he is at CNN and he really does believe in the me too movement and he really believes he's on the right side and he's having to go to work with a bunch of journalists who say you know we have for all these guys away and look they all do the\nHere I'm here to go bankrupt I Need to get into the guy and maybe I don't yeah I ... the other option is to die of drunk alone simply write in a bar [laughter] you know I was talking to somebody who is\nPretty well versed in media circles about this and and about ... a few weeks ago mhm and you're saying that like the the media knows this guy is a nut job ... they know he's in a job they know he's crazy really they know he is he's not a real player and they actually don't like him\nThey're just waiting for that moment to be able to charge them get rid of him and hear that we're here they've done and now they're all reporting on how all of his finances are terrible them all the background on his on his his uh you know\nSettlements in court that could have been done months ago you know they're they're just they're all set with him now there's so many interesting didn't work out yeah so they moved down to something which is intriguing there'll be at the Planned Parenthood setting up his office I'm sure so\nI'm sure I'm sure he's got to go someplace and listen to this and this is the way the media does these things right listen it is now George Soros reportedly\nHad an explosive device in his mailbox or over overnight mhm which needless to say but we should say in any way is\nA horrific idea if anyone were ever to do that and you are an awful person in every respect or if you were to be responsible for such a than other\nDays for the rest of my entire life up until last five or six years\nI Would say it it goes beyond saying that this shouldn't happen\nBut now you have to you you've got to be as if you don't say that well what does he looked he was condoning it\nYeah and and beyond that just goes to what we were talking about yesterday with Nancy Pelosi harassing Nancy Pelosi while she's out in the streets these are terrible terrible ideas heroin you either left don't do the things they're doing we've\nSeen that the left had been violent or ask people who were playing baseball this congressional baseball game or you know we've seen that before we've seen uh the harassment of officials in places I Would much rather have the on our argument\nOr as as in our repertoire of argument that we're not we're not the ones doing that they are so don't plan to that\nI you know I Know no one in this audience would and we have no idea by the way who did this I mean I certainly the speculation is is it George Soros opponent um you know someone on the on the right but I mean could be his wife and I was just saying we have no idea who it is right [laughter]\nBut listen to this coverage from the New York times that look\nI get that day or liberal I get it and I understand that they're not going to look at George Soros may be the same way that I Do\nAnd I [laughter] this is just to the point of like you've checked out mentally know write up a piece of a story that says this come on\nThough Mr ... name has become a trigger for a subset of Republicans and conservatives but right off the bat you're just condescending right it's not that he's done anything you could possibly disagree might trigger a name and forget that several countries\nHave named him an enemy of freedom not like I've been room put people but like leaf pass laws\nAgainst him [laughter] yeah it is a subset you know it's just about six countries have\n... named him in it you know a a a danger to their freedom in a band any of his money you know from coming into the country\nBut that's just a small subset and so how do you have any country as a ... you know\n... and the word trigger thank God it's normally use and conservative with say like some uh students here's a word they don't like and they go hide in the safe space that they were triggered right like it's a condescending term again for a talk show host for ... for Huffington Post blogger in mind to use that sort of like for the New York times\nToday uh the Mr sorts of names of them as a trigger a U.S\nForce subset of Republicans conservatives business at the airport and he is a he has said that his main goal is a political activist was to see a return of bipartisanship [laughter]\nYou know the ... world do you have to believe that she reports it everybody says they want bipartisanship\nGeorge Soros is not a bipartisan figure\nHe is one of the largest donors in the history of the Democratic party and he ... he launched a foundation that is funneled money to every crazy left wing calls on the planet but we're supposed to without question there is something like an arguing the only thing we hear from conservatives are triggered by his name\nWhat's his name George so very sorry it's it's so it's just happens sometimes\nHe said if you know it's crazy is you know who's more bipartisan the Koch brothers totally further yeah they're they're they're not conservatives they're libertarian which means they give to both sides sometimes they're on this side sometimes they're on that site foreign\nSocialist on social issues almost exclusively with the Democrats\nAre not concerned with it now and yet they're not bipartisan they're evil\nIt's actually in comprehensive under the covers listen to this one this is from uh New York times as well\nThis is their story about how anatomy does not determine gender experts say that's a headline let me just say that again but it would you say that again a nanny does not determine gender experts say God and now this is a force of pushback on Trump's policy to use biological sex as a as the ... factor and and I guess you don't get to just make it up anymore\nI'm ... I mean listen to this and I read this several times ... and it's actually changed and meaning as I've read it but listen to this\nHow do you define identity researchers say gender identity comes from the brain not the body some put it more bluntly it originates between your ears not between your legs now\nWhat they seem to to be describing their ... is something different than we're describing what they're describing is a feeling\nRight like I feel like I'm a woman now you can feel like you're a woman I Believe ...\nAt one point felt like a woman and I'm actually still ... fluid but it's ... who knows a but like I say that you feel that way is almost in a in a in a in a roundabout sort of way of criticism of transgender isn't right we're a conservative would say\nIt almost in a in a in a in a roundabout sort of wait a criticism of transgender isn't right we're a conservative would say you're\nNot transgendered you just feel like you're a transgender that's a different thing that is what it is that would be in the ceiling\nWhich used to be called if I'm not mistaken gender ... for a year\nAnd that feeling it was a was categorized by medical scientists as\nSomething that was harmful to your mental health right but I was there and and and certainly there are cases like that or where at least there used to be that there were admitted as a as a you know a real problem with in in mental health\nHowever there are other cases to wear like for example we use the term tomboy right for a girl who\nSeemed to like to do a lot of the things that boys did maybe acted like a boy a little bit and you call that person ... you didn't call them a an actual boy was it was a nickname for someone who was a girl what acted like a boy and I guess my question here would be if it's true\nGender comes from the brain not the body or into originates between your ears not between your legs why did they have surgery\nWhy do why did they change what is between their legs if it had nothing to do with what between their legs why these two things associated all they seem to be talking about a collection of personality attributes right like\nI like I like sports I like you know I like action movies I like you know giant and prime rib eye have generally issues that are interested or with a male therefore I'm male they're talking about male interests\nOr something you know who will be able to explain this who's going to be able to make sense one way or another explain both sides is a doctor Deborah so\nYes she be great let's call her up have her own tomorrow 'cause I like an explanation of\nWhy bother getting your gender those changed if it's got nothing\nTo derive channels and isn't that just gender does for a year\nAnd haven't we at times said that's bad what research has shown us that it's not bad because suicide rate remains the same\nSo we we've ... we've said this what this was bad because the genders foray leads all kinds of different things and and general unhappiness\nOkay so what research said that if we say that it's not bad and we go through with surgeries and everything that it will lead to a different outcome\nAnd I think like back then important piece of it I mean I think the outcomes are not all that positive but beyond that whether the outcome is good or bad there is truth\nNeal Hi no no I don't understand like the word gender meant sex organs forever mhm okay and if you want it instead of changing the word gender ... to mean something new\nThen in that and say okay actually this is an interesting a personality trait base the they seem to see themselves as a man and and isn't that interesting and they can do what the what they want I have no interest in what they're doing to themselves\nOr from a perspective from a libertarian perspective and whatever that they ... but like there is also a fact her\nSo let's get into this tomorrow because the fact on gender when you say well it used to mean sex well yeah it used to mean sex but it doesn't now and the guy who changed it was a psychopath yeah oh yeah and uh we'll we'll start with that and let's see if we can get a doctor so on tomorrow's program\nWe weaken our drug laws you sort of useful go up and so a dozen problems with drug abuse cause crime domestic violence and child abuse for all increase will see more homelessness aids and poverty and more students who do poorly in school or dropout altogether\nSubstance abuse causes unwanted pregnancy saw more pregnant teens and more abortion and there'll be more divorce more single moms more grandparents forced to raise their grandkids\nHere's what David Stringer doesn't understand the reason for drug laws is not to punish it's to keep all these problems from spinning out of control\nUm doctorate go

complete and total alignment among the drive by media\nNow in the last two weeks before the mid term elections in the mainstream media is completely ... they are completely in sync they are totally coordinated it doesn't matter\nWhere you go in the drive by media today you're going to see\nEverything under egg a subject heading or an umbrella Trump spreads wise and stokes fear I had an election\nThat graphic has been on CNN Ninety five percent of the of the time today\nSo much so I took a picture of it here to make sure that I Would remember it verbatim Trump's brand lies and stokes fears ahead of election\nWashington Post headline Trump and Republican settle on fear and false ... as a mid term strategy\nSame paper\nThen all through the two thousand sixteen campaign said that Trump would end up being another Hitler that Paul Krugman in the New York times said would cause an economic collapse from which the country would never recover\nRepublicans typically dominate early voting by absentee ballots while Democrats tend to have an advantage with in person early voting so for example the entire early voting picture in Florida which is you have to begin in person voting is complete\n\nNow that that is somewhat of a important point there because it's it's not just the the Republicans are doing better than Democrats in the states\nIt is that early voting almost always favors Democrats the usual pattern for all this stuff is that for Democrats are growing up in the early ...\nBecause of early voting and the Republicans have to then make up for a bad on election day itself but that's not what we're seeing here and they get Mrs NBC News\nSo the question here ... hard to apply this to actual election outcomes too much we don't know but one thing we do know this is not this is not according to rent it was a conventional wisdom is and conventional wisdom has been the Republican enthusiasm is kind of suppressed\nThat Democrat enthusiasm is off the charts\nThat the Democrats have been so motivated ever since they got screwed in two thousand sixty ever since Trump and the Russians stolen election from the Democrats have been motivated or like you can't believe the get out there and make this right\nAnd correct it and fix it they haven't been inspired David energized they've been motivated\nThey'd been donating they cannot wait and\nYet in\nEight key Republican state key key battleground states Republican early voting is dwarfing Democrat early voting and violating\nAll that Bush norms all statistical norms\nUh-huh you factors is this is the kind of\nResolve the kind of thing that's happening that nobody in conventional Washington\nElitist establishment Washington what do you ever think would happen these people come up with their story that stuck with it if it even if it means they're lying to themselves about it like for example if they if they get it in their heads everybody hates Trump\nAnd that hatred for Trump has brought in and magnified over two years ... therefore there's going to be this nasty\nIf they get it in their heads the everybody hates Trump and that hatred\nFor Trump has brought in and magnified over two years ... therefore there's going to be this\nMassive turnout among Democrats can't wait to vote energized when they get that in their heads and they believe it and then the exact opposite happens and they don't know what to do about it and they get\nNon plus and a little concerned about which is where\nThey are now and I've shared with you yesterday there's a there's a lot of stories\nAre about the blue wave not happening that it simply doesn't look like it is materialize here is the Washington Post battleground house district remained close\nIn a new poll over here we got the cook report\nEight

the Republicans lose the house eighty six percent chance of Democrats when how does all this fit\nTogether well it doesn't obviously\nYou're Republican early voting is out distancing Democrat early voting and Democrats have always owned that\nMust mean that something is drastically wrong here something is\nTerribly wrong and the formula\nFor this kind of Republican enthusiasm in an off year mid
