we're actually hurting ourselves\nUm you talk about our God really kind of being identity no news plane that at\nThe top and we we kind of as a nation moved ourselves into factions and what I don't want is Christians to be a faction in a world of factions [noise] um I think that's the part of the problem but but I think you know people identify themselves as you know I'm I'm this or that I've got a social media community and\nAnd and then that faction sort of becomes identity becomes a faction the faction becomes an echo chamber and then ultimately are we the volume just goes up up up up and the anger just goes up up up up and and we can't survive I think as a nation factional ... at this level eventually you'll Balkan eyes to use a term from history will get a break apart\nAnd so I think the ultimate thing is I I Can't you know I Can't solve all the political things here you got much bigger platform talk about politics than I Do I'm just trying to help Christians to say All right how do we react and how do we respond and the answer is is not to take our identity from anything other\nThan king Jesus and and and again I Know that's overtly spiritual but we're talking here in this this focus I mean so it's to take out any for Jesus Jesus is not coming back on air force one he's not riding a dump irrelevant when he does and to acknowledge that I'm only all in as a Christian\nAnd following Christ and everything else is shaped around that my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom that's kind of our motto here we college my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom than anything else\nSo I explained his yesterday that um you know the the so called Christians of the Westboro Baptist church you know they they hold up signs you know God hates this got hate that blah blah blah they're just despicable you don't win\nBy by holding up signs no God hates view and shouting things back you win by listening by understanding by him racing them as a soul or a brother and sister not to do what they're doing\nStanding up but people have been changes one woman in particular that actually left her own family in the Westboro Baptist church that's right because somebody spoke to her with civil civility and said let's just reason here for a minute\nThat's okay I I I'm On my desk actually right every front of me a name played because they actually protested at my church we went out and serve them coffee and doughnuts and they called me and the national news\nI Can't use one of the words probably on the radio but all lying the false prophet and so it's actually one of my staff made into a name played it says it says lined Blanco false prophet Westboro Baptist church which by the way is wrapped it does either Baptist church\nBut but in doing so I mean the question is how do we respond well somebody reached out actually interviewed one of members of the family as well uh crocheting today so somebody reached out and I will tell you I think that's what we can do right now with the blue deeply disagree with us in\nThe book is filled with examples of Christians who actually built relationships with people who radically disagreed and in the process where able to come to maybe a better understanding I Want examples for example is a is the president by all university which is a Christian university in California\nUh met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party has the legislature there in California that was trying to change laws that would make it illegal for ... to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more while he ended up getting to understand each other better the will the bill was ultimately not moved forward but dropped and and and now we're at a very ...\nYou do that but I Am saying that Christians need to try to do that and I do think that in doing so well liked a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians historically because of the moment we're in is not\nTime for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and and as you said earlier to your caller I'm calling people to arms yet that's not I mean ... that's not an uncommon of you know some of the some of the worst things I see on social media I I click on a lake\nAnd I find go to the bio and it's the first thing listen thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like\nAnd I think that's what we need is a change in a lotta arts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us this right now or the the victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained as slaves\nOr you know story after story after story of these Christian who I mean I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you I'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're going to come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit\nAnd we're gonna crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and said\nUnderstand we forgive you for that we're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with pita yeah unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate 'cause you know victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and
