portraying dope 'em and I think it's the way most conservatives feel right like yeah they get they can do it but it's not that I mean that's not the right way I don't support what they're saying and what their what their actions are correct a support single payer healthcare\nFifty six percent say yes thirty seven percent say no\nAnd that if you're wondering why you're getting so many people jumping on that bandwagon at the polls like that that's why the Democrats are doing\nDo you want Congress to check Trump fifty three percent say yes thirty eight percent say no also by the way the

investigation\nFifty two percent say yes forty two percent say no these are independent\nVoters compare that with another poll yes he's the Russia investigation a witch hunt forty nine percent say yes forty seven percent say no it's interesting they support the investigation but they do believe that it's politically motivated and with no real end to it\nThis is this this poll is the first time and you're not going to get this without ... who's publishing all of it or they'll just give you the highlights of they'll say oh you know fifty two percent say that the lower investigation yeah but they won't say forty nine percent also think that it's a witch hunt\nSo people are nuanced\nAnd if they they think it's worth looking into um you know right either looking into it just to make sure but we don't think there's anything bear\nThis one surprises me elected more feminists forty nine percent say yes thirty three percent say no\nAnd that's similar to the women question that right I mean it's

their\nThe support of Trump's tariffs thirty three percent\nWithin the margin of error of abolish ice that's how popular that that idea is now I don't care if it's a hundred percent approval I Would still oppose it because I don't think it's a good idea but it is not even at a popular proposal it's not winning over any voters ... you know it is again the the worst policy of his presidency up my\nBelief Kavanaugh accusations this one is fascinating believes the Kavanaugh accusations twenty six percent say the twenty five twenty eight I Believe twenty eight percent say yes twenty nine

is it a bigger problem per se is the question has always been dug that exist at all\nBut I think that's what's a forty percent is saying there that they deny the press denies that it doesn't even exist you write independence saying forty percent of independents go yeah yeah worse than we do worse than what we typically think of race right now I mean that's a ... it's a big number it ah it verifies that it does exist\nOr what Republicans to keep the house forty percent say yes forty five percent say no approve of Trump forty one percent of independents say yes fifty one say no just a quickly\nPaired that again I mean forty one percent approve of Trump of forty nine percent of the Russia investigation as a witch hunt that's those are two together that same ... it's pretty interesting\nSupports Kavanaugh's confirmation forty four percent yes forty five percent no or his help the Trump helped you economically forty seven to forty seven uh the Russia investigation is which\nFive percent no or his help the Trump help do economically forty seven to forty seven uh the Russia investigation is it a witch hunt forty nine forty seven we are a divided nation but\nWe

an\nExecutive order reversing the fourteenth a magnet we want to discuss how maybe he can he's gonna run into activist judges that'll that'll turn him down here but the point is\nThat you need somebody like Donald Trump into the fourteenth amendment is what grants citizenship to anybody born in America and it was intended it goes back to the Eighteen hundreds it was intended to grant\nCitizenship to slaves and their descendants\nNow how would you how do you think modern African Americans they would feel if the fourteenth amendment\nA blue wave means a massive massive

they'll call it whatever they want\nIf they emerge victorious\nBut all of these ... were designed to cause this blue way were designed to create this massive voter intensity and it turned out\nBy Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than democratic turnout unheralded that's unprecedented\nRepublicans seldom show up this while in early voting it's hard to explain it away but the conclusion isn't there has been no blue way there is not even been a blue ripple back you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip\nSome blue bubbles are bursting recall

a\nToss up I don't know how to factor all of that that's more retirements in a single year than we're ever used to having to factor in here and the power of incumbency and those forty five seats\nHas

now looks like the Democrats might win the house by\nTwo maybe for the and that's going to be designed to get you to not\nGet lazy and overconfidence don't don't be dispirited by any of that you hear

together all these years is the\nHonoring him a lecture results yeah have a heated campaign you may have political parties and all of us really don't like each other but whoever won the election decided who\nHad a chance at running the country and both sides acknowledge that and it wasn't that long ago you can go back to two thousand two when the Democrats lost those mid term elections in shock\nGeorge W Bush's first midterm elections after winning in two thousand a drive by the left were convinced that they were going to sweep the house away never going to sweep the Senate wave with people were fed up with the Florida recount remember all that\nAl Gore got job but Democrats got cheated and Democrats were loaded for bear out what happened the Republicans won an\nAvid seats in an off year election what the Democrats they accepted it\nFor the most part and they started talking about how well we're gonna have to modify some of what we believe a lot of values are basis because exit poll showed that values were a large factor in\nWhy people voted Republican well fast forward it two thousand six than there is no knowledge with a Trump won they do not accept\nThe election results that's what these past two years have been about and are going to remain about they don't accept Trump's election as legitimate because they didn't want it we've gotten to a point where the radical\nLeft simply because it doesn't feel good about this is willing to overthrow an election and its results and the way this happened\nTop levels of the Obama D. O. J. we're used to overthrow run a silent cool to try to throw Donald Trump back out of office and reverse those election results it's unprecedented\nPat Buchanan has peace out today that uh reminds people Nineteen sixty eight featured even more violent unrest that we have yet seen this year but we're getting close\nYou can always go back in time and find period where it was worse than it is at present you can always go back inside the civil war but it is a seminal moment when a political party\nAs its official position refuses to accept election results and that's\nWhere we are and that's why we're where we are they refused to accept it for whatever reason they hate Trump they don't feel good about it they just read whatever doesn't matter why [noise]\nThat's why we're where we are they refused to accept it for whatever reason they hate Trump they don't feel good about it they just rip whatever doesn't matter why just the fact that they refused to accept the results\nIs a horribly dangerous thing because what if it keeps up what if the only time there is peace in America is when they win elections\nYou know I I predict it some time ago that they're going to figure this out at some point and the natural conclusion to figuring this out is well let's just eliminate elections of elections or what's holding us back let's find a way that will lemonade\nPeople laugh and combined Ross it's never going to have to do not ever say the left isn't capable of anything ever\n\nSo now Trump rather than being intimidated by their refusal to accept this election rather than any of these feelings hurt Trump doubles down triples down every time they hit him he hits back with\nAdditional energy and verve and I'm telling you this promise with an executive order to end birthright citizenship is huge\nAnd it's why he was elected\nWhen things are going terribly wrong and they are in our country right now when things are terribly wrong and out of control\nYou have to have somebody willing to go outside the so called boundaries in Trump's doing it every day and willing to do so because this is what pushing back\nThis is what defiance this is what changing the left as though it looks like it was never going to be pretty it was never going to be why it was never going to be clean\n\nIt requires a strong stomach and strong fortitude and there's I don't think any elected Republican other than Trump even if they had made the promises Trump made I think all of them would have caved by now\nBut Trump hasn't it doubles now All right I'm going to just some of the district executive order I'm going to end the birthright citizenship let me read the or the fourteenth amendment how it begins\nAll persons not the fourteenth amendment goes back to Eighteen ... I think it was ratified by Congress and agents sixty six\nNo it was passed by Congress ratified by the state's two years later so agents sixty six it was passed by Congress ratified with estates Eighteen sixty eight and its original intent was to grant citizenship to slaves and their descendants\nAnd it was part and parcel of post civil war era of America fixing itself it was a good thing\nUh our constitution was written so that mistakes at the time and it could be corrected vast majority of people do slavery of the founding was was tenable but they needed the union in order to fight\nThe revolutionary war they needed the southern states they needed unity to do that so they had to accept slavery but they built in safeguards to wipe it out they have happened in ancient sixty eight the fourteenth amendment begins this white all persons born or\nNaturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction there of our citizens of the U.S end of the state where\nIn they reside it was clearly intended to be referring to slaves and their descendants the parts that birthright citizenship a freaks after delete\nArt naturalized and subject to the jurisdiction that Rob\n\nYou are not naturalized and you are not subject to the U.S jurisdiction if you're here illegally\nYou cannot be you're under some other countries jurisdiction if you're here illegal you cannot possibly be naturalized\nWell the birthright citizenship crowd which ones don't watered down American culture and destroy western civilization conveniently leaves out naturalized and subject to the jurisdiction that Rob\n\nSo your born here or child absolutely is not a citizen and this is what Trump is saying Trump has finally pushing back against them as some shouldn't that has been made because it\nWas the least half of resistance if you will but now it's it's make or break time\n\nAs my friend McCarthy says you need somebody to break the furniture some time to go to remodel", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "30"}
