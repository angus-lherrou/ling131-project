with Hillary Clinton coming out and saying you can't\nThere's nothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period whom himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows this history very well when he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in a New Testament world and Romans one where he's when he's when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world anybody I\nUsed to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff it would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the other way around I I think we do bad stuff\nBecause we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law uh it it kind of been forces itself and so you're dealing with people that with the wind and the and the New Testament there when you exchange Dutch truth for a lie so there's one big macro truth in in the universe\nAnd there's a lot but there's lots of eyes right or to buy supplies so when you see changes that truth for a law you're given over to a database to mind and that's what you're talking about and I go back you know what it is my favorite movie rants when I was a kid and it's probably a terribly placed analogy\nBut Donald presence rant and the first Halloween movie about Michael Meyers can't be killed they can't be stopped it can't be reason with right when he's going off about him and when he was like in the insane asylum\nThat's what you're dealing with here there is no talking look at the guy who ... who
