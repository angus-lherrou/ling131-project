you\nSo so for people who don't follow a Whitey ... give us that give tell his story\nA it's a it's a long and complicated tale but in a nutshell a you know he uh ran south Boston neighborhood called ... and over twenty five year period he\nThe security and uh you know it's still unclear to me I'm Still trying to get some information as to why he was being moved and why the multiple moves and why the lack of security\nOr you know some people are speculating that this was a purposeful move uh I I Can't say that but um you know a guy who's involved in multiple murders over decades and involved in bringing down the mafia or you know with an axe with you know be a target\nWhere we are talking to a job earlier he is the director of why the United states of America versus James James Bulger who's the you know Whitey I'm and\nI'm I guess what was it that practice due to the story why why did you make the film and what did you what attracted you to and and what did you take away from it\nYeah I mean I thought that uh you know Bolger\nFinally bring being brought to trial because there's there's such a mess about the guy there such folklore [noise]\nYou know in our society is unfortunately we tend to glamorize only heros out of criminals are Bolger probably is the greatest example of that so much folklore surrounding him so much hero worship\nUm films that kind of\nThe grizzly side of or the or the aftermath of of what he was responsible for even if it does show the details of of how people are killed you know we we celebrate criminals in this society which is which is an odd\nPhenomenon and so the idea that he was being brought back to trial finally the face the music I thought would be a great opportunity to kind of separate fact from fiction and to really understand\nThe crimes that that was my going in assumption but\nSitting through that trial and witnessing it and getting to know Bolger are in fact I was the only journalist allowed to actually interview him because the a defense attorneys\nBasically trusted me versus some other journalists in part because of my previous worn films like Paradise Lost um uh you know what fascinated me and ... and what my big turn was was just how ... the government has been in allowing a killer to run\nRoughshod over the streets of Boston and how you know he his informant you know if you're going to allow somebody to evade justice for twenty five years you would hope that the record of\nWhat you got to eat what he what you got out so rock solid and I so points to like\nOh my God this guy was invaluable but I ... the evidence was just not there for me you know he was he was in who he was in the logbooks as as being an informant but you know if you really drill into it there's very little information gave that the feds didn't already have and so then the question is why was he allowed\nAnd even if he gave the best information on the planet and he is directly responsible for the end of the mafia in New England as we know it which was not the case um ... you still have to question you know is doing up the government allowing somebody like that to commit murder and they knew it\nJoe ...

running around doing these things\nIs is a bunch of deranged people who are out of their minds and I'm telling you\nIt can happen\nTo among the most feeble if there's just a steady diet of the negative\nUpon negative drumbeat on television today that is described as new as it is not news it is the Democrat Party agenda but it is not news\nIt hasn't been news for quite awhile audio soundbite

Oklahoma City in Nineteen Ninety five inhaled he didn't go after the\nTerrorists he\nDidn't sort of make a you know be the drums didn't go out and start the terrorists\nWill\nLet's go back and listen to what Gergen thanks was Bill Clinton's finest moment April twenty fourth Nineteen Ninety five ... in Minneapolis\nHere so many loud and angry voices in America today whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up and upset with each other\nThey spread hey they leave the impression that\nBy their very words that violence is acceptable you oughta see I'm sure you are now seeing the reports are some things that are regularly said over the airwaves in America today it is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless speech\nRight now who couldn't even talking about this Nineteen Ninety five there is no Fox News the Blago ... told the airwaves\nOr this\nIs where he attempted to blame me everybody you know what at the time and it was even applauded by some not everybody\nAt the White House felt some have they have the issue of correctional say no we were talking about the Michigan Militia short\nWave radio network that's what we meant by angry voices on the right the Michigan Militia was a media creation I mean there might have been some guys hiking around in the woods with some guns were on camera gear and the media had video of it but the Michigan Militia was a non factor in any of this and you get right up but there's Clinton's zeroing in\nWell some guns were in camel gear and the

very warmly received there were no protesters going on for you remember those days\nAnd how about you know President Obama who unfortunately had all these mass shootings on his watch in South Carolina in Connecticut and you know he led the grieving and all those places frankly wouldn't even occur to me that there would have been protests\nSee so now there were no protest for a bomb and there's no protests when Clinton went out but there's all kinds of protests when Trump goes out meaning what\nTrump's guilty But Trump's at fault it's the protestors are right why weren't the early protests back in those days we'll take a look at who the victims were number one but what why we're there no protests\n\nPrecisely because the left very rarely protest its own people they protest for no reason at
