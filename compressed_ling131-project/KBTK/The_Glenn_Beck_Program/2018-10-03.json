transaction is continuous linking buyer and seller and giving\nThe seller a post transaction power impossible and physical markets why is that important\nSo I think this is important for a an a number of reasons it leads to the scenarios that we were talking about earlier where the ... of the good as the ability not only to sort of reclaim a or recall the good but they also have some ability to control\nHow and when and under what circumstances you make use of that product after the sale\nThat's just not something that you could do ... and the tangible world right you or your local bookstore

you get to lend that book too and they certainly can't keep records of all of those interactions\nAnd the digital world allows for\nThat that form of\nControl [noise] and unfortunately it's not limited just to digital media or we have all these smart devices in our homes on our bodies\nUm you know we've got our voice assistance and hour fitness trackers and you know even a home appliances and cars they all have software\nThey all have network connections and all these sort of uh problems that as I've been describing are going to play out in that space is well Mm where device makers are not only going to be able to track your behavior but they're also going to be able to limit the ways in which you can use the products\nThat you think uh you have to\nPurchase oh I'm so let me let me interrupt here and and just ask you this I see when I go to iTunes I see a movie I Want to watch it says rent or own I'm not owning yet I'm just renting it in a different way isn't is false advertising\nI so I think there's a really good case to be made here that companies like Amazon and apple they use language like oh and by words that have real meaning for people in their everyday lives\nAre missed stating that the nature of those transaction so\nUh my coauthor Christos ... go and I wrote a paper a few years ago a couple of years ago now I'm called what we buy when we buy now\nThat did a survey of about Fifteen hundred consumers to figure out what people think this language rules and it turns out that a significant percentage of consumers\nIncorrectly believe\nThat they do have true ownership rights they get to keep these goods they can lend to them they can give them away and we think that there is an opportunity here to\nCorrect this misinformation in the marketplace but think about the company that we're talking about you know apple and Amazon are to the biggest corporations that the world has ever seen\nAnd getting them to\nA\nConvincing them to not going to have in a more clear and fair way as it is a real challenge\nClass action lawsuit\n[noise] so I think there is a possibility for class action litigation here they're they're a bunch of\nA legal or impractical hurdles to making that happen I think it's something worth pursuing I think the Federal Trade commission that has a role to play here this is a squarely within their um\n[noise] uh within their areas of of expertise and obligation to police the market and make sure that consumers have accurate information\nAaron I'm go ahead yeah I I just wouldn't go ahead\n... the the way the market works that hands on consumers below four people can't make rational choices people can't decide where to spend their money if they're being misled about the products that they're getting so I think it's crucial for for the function of the market or to have that information be correct\nHave you done any look into what a society with out real ownership I mean we're down to you know renting clothes and everything else\nUh and that's only going to get stronger as as as we move forward have you looked into what that means for a capitalist society and for America in particular that has always been about ownership\nAnd doesn't that also doesn't also stop innovation I mean sometimes the guy who take something and then tinkers with it comes up with a better system but if I'm if I'm locked out of tinkering\nOn my own property or it it ... it it almost creates this uh this feeling of oh well that's just the way it is and that's the way it always is going to be just runs that way and it stops innovation doesn't it\nI I think it has the real risk of doing that it it discourages people from being created it discourages people from um from as he said ... with the same as it they are we have a lot of ah incredible innovations that have been made a over the centuries in this country\nThat didn't come from giant ... departments they came from individuals messing around with things that down and our garage and there is a risk that were for closing those kinds of opportunities\nBut even even more broadly at\n'em if we're just courage and thinking of ourselves as independent actors in the world [noise] you know I worry that that creates a sort of complacency and\nA and our population in our country and you know not not ... uh to to lie to the level here but for a democracy to function people have to steal and they have to be in charge of their own lives asked to be invested in making informed decisions\nAnd not worry that that ... you know this\nThis lack of control over the every day this is my play too much broader set of problems when it comes to people feeling like active participants in society in democracy\nI couldn't agree with you um I couldn't agree with you more um I I just don't think this is the way society is thinking anymore everything is about the collective and very little is about the individual and you know I think you understood you are under state of the case\nOf tankers I mean if you look at the inventions in America that a lot of them a lot of our progress came from what used to be called tankers people who just did things in their own garage in and uh\nAnd now the weather's the government or these corporations every one is being told that the way it is sit down shut up you can't do anything about it and I think that's extraordinary I mean that's that that\nYou know in in decades that's what created China in many ways that's what they don't think of things the same way that we do they don't have that that\nUm spirit of invention that America has always been known for\nSo I I agree with you that um that the history of innovation in this country has um benefited greatly from individual creators\nAnd we we need to keep an environment in which people have that ability to experiment um to innovate and ultimately it to just share of that progress a with a with the rest of the country and the rest of the world\nI worry that we're moving in that direction where um people aren't able to build those skill sets because they live in a world of sort of lock down digital life\nSo let me ask you one more question and I'll let you go I Know you've spent twice the amount of time here that you you probably planned on um the last one more question I Am really concerned about copyrights patents trademarks we\nSeem to be entering a world where\nPeople don't take somebody's intellectual property seriously on the on the other side of this um they just feel that too well I can download it I can just take it\nA an itch we shouldn't have intellectual property rights that that is frightening because again that was the second piece of the American experiment was\nYou have a right to that intellectual property for a period of time so you can make money on it which encourages other people to come up with their own ideas\n\nDo you see this why do you see this fading and his trouble on the horizon as well\nSo I I write in each about intellectual property and it's something that I take 'em very seriously and one of the things that I always try to communicate to my students\nIs that you know actual property system functions best when there is a balance between the interests of the public\nAnd the interests of creators and the history of intellectual property copyright in particular is it is a history of a struggle\nTo find and and and that appropriate about 'em\nI think we're we're going through and have been going through a kind of since the last for adoption of the Internet a period where we're struggling with how to answer some of those questions are there are certainly areas in which um copyright holders have legitimate concerns\nAbout air works being exploited without\nAnd on the other hand we live in a culture in which um copyrighted works a sort of um\nIncreasingly among a distributed with within these environments\nLike apple and Amazon for example where consumers can't do the same that they think they're\nEntitled or should be ... to do it so I think that part of the solution here is providing consumers a strong incentive to pay for these works um that's one of the the\nProviding consumers a strong incentive to pay for these works um that's one of the things that streaming services I think I've gotten quite\nA which is that they offer a really attracted you to consumers so people learn that if they're going to access the world's libraries music they have to pay for the privilege and you're not how that money gets distributed\nIn what the price point is I think is is one of the sticking point so it's an important set of questions and I'm One that I probably can't do justice to um\nYou know a couple of minutes yeah All right Aaron thank you so much I

more stimulating [noise]\nGoing back [noise]\nWe um uh [noise] we're talking to 'em Larry's wise or he is the president of government accountability Institute the producer of a documentary\nCalled the creepy line the creepy line dot com um we're talking about Google and Larry I've never I've never believed in you know those dystopian movies I've always made fun of them and said yeah this is this is crazy that you know the corporations out to get you\nBecause of their algorithms because they are so all encompassing\nThat is the world were headed towards what do they tell you when they say\nAlgorithms that we have to keep that top secret because\nYeah they what they argue is that it's for reasons of of a state secret\nUm and and you know that they need to protect our trade secrets they need to be a a you know making sure that nobody gets access to it there's some truth to that but there are a lot of things that they could do to demonstrate um that they're offering a fair product in service to people and here's the thing that they have lied about this before\nYou know ten years ago or so you had other companies like trip advisor and Yelp who were saying that Google was artificially suppressing their rankings in Google in favor of Google owned companies which okay you know Google has the right to do that but here's the thing\nGoogle flat out lied and said absolutely not we don't do that our algorithm is pure it's true the best results or ... or or organically at the top well here's the problem the Federal Trade commission the European Union\nProfessors at Harvard University looked at this and said yes you are fiddling with the algorithm you are screwing these other competitors and you're lying to the point is when Google says you can trust the algorithm you can trust us they've lied before and they're lying now and I think the only question that remains really is how are we going to deal with this\nUm you know there's old story that Henry Kissinger said when he was on the national Security Council you give a president three choices do nothing\nTake my solution or thermonuclear war those are your three choices are in this case it's kind of like that we can do nothing\nWe can try to deal with some sort of the regulatory issues related with Google or we can break up these companies those are the three options that we have and I think we're really at the point of point number three\n'cause this is not a monopoly like standard oil sands oil but it's going to dominate the all market this is controlling the news flow in the United\nStates is in the end this isn't the and Peter ... controlling everything yes Google is ... the most likely company in the America in the American world\nOr to come up with a guy yes who ever who ever gets to a I first controls everything there is no way to beat it once you have a guy yes this company is the most likely in the free world to come up with it\nIf we don't have them\n... contained in some way or another when they get to a high we're toast yes\nYes that's exactly right and here's the thing it's not just\nGoogle the company a lot of people don't realize is I didn't realize this if you use safari on your apple product you're actually using the Google algorithm and that is Google information on if you're using if you are using um Yahoo\nYou're using Google the point being Firefox is Google the all these entities are using the Google algorithm so even if you say I Am not going to use Google dot com you're using unless you are making very specific choices for other options if you using any of those others\nGoogle is the one that's dominated by the way Google pays apple\nNine billion dollars a year Google actually pays apple\nAll for their age I research\nSo Google isn't fried rice for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product we say what his rules product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of it look\nYou know there's that this is just at the beginning let me tell you is bouquet story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of Beijing how many people it used to look it up for me well you're still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy mhm pick somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide\nOkay [laughter] they had a picture of the guy\nAnd the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then\nAfter like an hour or two they gave the leaves system the picture of the guy and said find him\nIn eight minutes he was in the back of a squad car unbelievable in ... minutes yes city of twenty two million yeah twenty two million it's amazing in eight minutes yeah so and this is without AI right this is the kind of stuff that is coming that people really need to pay attention to that's right\nAnd and Google or is it the forefront of that they they take a position of pride that they are the forefront of exploiting future technologies real quick though on Gmail this is very important for people to realize that just shows you how far Google goes\nI used to have a Gmail account now what ... does is they scan every email that comes into your Gmail accounts and ... ... email you send out you know what else they scan\nIf you ever written a draft email let's say you're mad at your cousin ... you know I'm sick of you know cousin Chris and all the crazy stuff he does and you write in late one night you write a draft and you say you know what I don't think I'm going to send that to Chris that's just me\nBeing on just a second I Want to make sure this is writing a draft but that's not saving it as a draft correct It's just you ... it ... the delete delete delete delete delete delete it's not even saving it as a draft\nRight correct that's correct it scanned by Google\nSo Google knows more about you than you know you can have a very open and completely transparent relationship with anybody in your life your spouse\nYour best friend whatever Google knows more about you than they do and they are very aggressively going to retain that information but they're using it against you here's the key thing it's not just privacy it's manipulation because they want to take that information and not just sell information to advertisers\nThey as part of their mission want to steer and move your life in a certain direction that they deem is the way the direction your life should go\nThere to be your choice or the ... documentary as the creepy line a couple of pushback and a couple of sure or at least problems I have 'cause I'm with you on Ninety percent of this\nOne issue I have is Google is awesome\nIt all of the products that they make are better than everybody else's product at a similar ... and it it would eat incredibly inconvenience me\nTo give up Google because all of their products work better than everybody else's James doesn't know [laughter] what do you do because I mean yes they're everywhere they're doing really good job yeah ... uh when it comes to designing an easy to use product right ... that's that's a great\nQuestion and it's not easy I mean there are alternatives search a systems out there um but none of them are as good as Google\nAnd it's not really that I don't know I think that's a a a road that people will go down\nThat what we should go down is we should be talking to the people in ... no no no\nWe should be sending people who understand this right to Washington because by the time we talked to Washington it's already over we need people who understand the ethics of what's going on with high tech in Washington\nBecause they need to have this conversation right now it's not about us changing our behavior right it's to the point we must corral Google\nAnd break them up or corral them in some way not with just a little litigation because I'm a ... litigation but uh no it was just little simple laws if I'm gonna cut because they'll go around that that fire right\nOkay let me even one other one yeah you said this earlier and it made me very uncomfortable and my suspicion is it makes you very uncomfortable to which is your solution we see we're leaning towards breaking up these companies and as a capitalist as a person who does not want the government involved right or in private business\nI mean how do you how do you have a bridge that guy\nNo I mean I I think that's a great point and I came reluctantly tennis as I looked at all the possible things to do with Google here's the problem in this case the way that technology is moving how Google exerts it's market dominance it really we really do not have a free market in search\nUh it's really impossible in fact one of the guys we we interviewed a vice president Yelp or him in our in our a film\nOr and the founder of Yelp said he wouldn't start you off today because it'd be impossible Google would smother them the only reason that Yelping these other entities have survived as they have built up enough brand equity when they were founded what Fifteen Twenty years ago to where they can exist so we have a situation where\nThere are truly is not a functioning\nA monopoly and by the way Google's market dominance is partly related\nTo its political alliance in Washington they pass laws and rules all the time to squelch competition a veteran in Santa Fe and to\nDo things like the platform me yes we are not a publisher we're a platform right then they go in and they edit will now Europe publisher you're not a platform so they play it both ways and they're they have the money to do it\nYes and that's a hugely important point because when they first one it or it set up the regulation for the Internet it was if your publisher you're treated as a media company if you're a neutral platform which is what Google and Facebook\nThe first one it or it set up the regulation for the Internet it was if your publisher you're treated as a media company if you're a neutral platform which is what Google and Facebook claim they are they say we're not going to any content they even use the analogy were like a telegraph\nWe're just taking a telegraph message from Peter and we're sending it to Glenn nothing else is happening when we all know that's not true now they're editing or they're censoring so they are acting as publishers but unlike other publishers they don't face the legal or regulatory burns that they do so well here in competition\nOr even the public scrutiny even the ... you sound like you're crazy if you talk against Google letter editing I Know that they are right the wouldn't one solution be to make their algorithms transparent\n[noise] Ah yes that would help but the algorithm is changing constantly and and I do get I Am sympathetic to the argument that this is a trade secret that they work very very hard to develop and they have\nUm I think by breaking them up into pieces and by the way I don't think it's just two companies I think it's several different Colombia and alphabet [laughter] um I think it would be would be extremely helpful in the way to go on this um because otherwise they're going to continue to re exert market dominance\n... the other thing I hear conservatives talk about and I find this terrifying is to make them a utility oh no no because I don't know\nI don't know what the utilities are like here in Dallas oh no\n[laughter] Texas we don't really have a we have an open energy yeah oh that's so we have five different energy company as in yeah we don't pay any idea\nWhat it was a notion of making Google a public utility ... which really means you're making it a government utility now means you've got the government\nControlling search no I live in a no interest in that whatsoever and what you are seeing is is merging of Google which used to be generally out of politics very little lobbying very little interaction when Barack Obama was elected in two thousand eight\nYou saw this enormous influx of Google people into Washington DC and they stayed so it is now one of the most plugged in if not the most plugged in corporation in America so this notion that there are kind of these wild cat or out in Silicon valley that are like independent from government is just totally ridiculous I could\nSpend
