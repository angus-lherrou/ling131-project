how like that got race on Halloween\n\n... amazing ... and ... is that is that's such a question that you should be drummed out of all society right but that that's what's amazing about the first of all we should point out that\nThere's a lot of people in a side of it would be the the one in her out for other reasons oh my gosh Shelly ... do you use to push is now you can tell you this has nothing to do if she could have said that easily and been applauded\nHad she not come from Fox\nHad she'd come from CNN or she was on the left or whatever the that crowd would've applauded her saying that and I think they are there's a lot of people that it didn't appreciate her coming out against NBC personalities on the sexual assault stuff ... as well\nBut just just talking specifically about let's forget all that exist and talk about back but actual conversation her\nPoint is what is important when you're trying to decipher someone doing something that is racist for example is the motivation right the motivation is what is important the words themselves can be bad or good but the motivation is what is important let's go further than black face for a second the N. word\nRight the N. word when said by someone carrying a torch in Charlottesville we all understand really bad mhm when Chris Rock says it\nNot so bad why because we know Chris Rock motivation is not because he says terrible racist we know in Charlottesville the case is that they are terrible racist or in this bin ... to the city of Charlottesville who now if they're named just sit on to this with racism but I mean we're talking about here\nThe the if you have an All right figure you have Richard Spencer you have some hardcore racist saying the N word it means something different and the motivation is different in that important\nLike it but I Will say this ... it is still I I don't care who\nSays the N word I think it's a disgusting word I Do too I don't I don't like that word used by anybody but you don't get jumped out of society correct you if you're if you're a Chris Rock because everybody knows\nThat your motivation is not the deep hatred of racism and another example it's always sunny in Philadelphia is a is the longest running a live action sitcom in us history fourteen season is going to sign up for the fourteenth season\nAt least once and I think twice they've done entire episode where they're white characters were in blackface\nK now their motivation as liberals right\nTheir motivation is to show that racism is really dumb and their characters are really dumb and their dressing up this way and they're showing how stupid they are and making the point that they think it's okay to dress up in blackface but they actually did it on camera multiple episode this is a liberal icon of our program\nOK totally okay for them to do it\nBut for her to question it and say if it's a positive motivation is that okay well I don't remember\nI don't remember a lot of an outcry from the left over it's always sunny and Philadelphia doing it multiple times they did an entire episode ... which is one of the greatest television episodes of any series of all time called the gang turns black\nAnd they they have a situation where they all wake up one after getting the electric or getting struck by lightning and they're all black and they have to live with black people for the day and they ... minutes orderly amazing but\nBeyond that it is something that there's been no pushback on look at things like family guy you'll see the animation but still the same types of things happen\nBecause they believe and we all kind of like well the motivation there is that he he's that they're not trying to be racist and I've started trying to the black people are inferior or anything like that they're doing this to make a point on the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay\nWhat she's saying here is if the motivation is good let's say a child for example who think they want to dress up as a hero of there's a happens to be black\nHe was doing exactly what Hugo Chavez did he came in and then he was going to change the constitution exactly the way Hugo Chavez has changed the constitution and made it into a a a dictatorship so the Supreme Court\nSaid the president is acting unconstitutionally talk to the other branch you need to arrest him an exile him the other branch did so two branches of the government ousted him said that's not what we do\nWe don't want to be a Hugo Chavez Venezuela okay\nHe said ever since then we Hondurans have lived in chaos many things try to buy a ... and his a party to liberate which translates to Freedom Party to destabilize our country\nThis is just the latest stunned and it's all a a a blames America and has also made America is now reaping what its own type statements\nHe has said that America must take in the migrants because America has supported the current administration that he now claims has caused all of the misery that we as Hondurans are living through this is why they're marching with a Honduran flag because\nThey blame us for their misery\nThis is nothing more she writes than a strong arm tactics to embarrass both Honduras and America sadly the migrants were lied to and had been told that America must accept them in\nIn one news report a lady who was interviewed told the Honduran reporter that they were promised buses to travel once they got to Guatemala but there were no buses waiting on them that I could tell from the report some of the migrants have returned home\nOne twenty two year old man died in Mexico for reasons unknown as of yet\nThis is really sad and frustrating because many migrants are have been a had been told that they will get in and they will get jobs once they arrive in America and therefore many are good with the hopes of a better life\nHowever these are types of situations that criminals\nAre a might have been the organizers of the march will take advantage of\nPlease keep spreading the truth about this situation I enjoy all of your content and you're a podcast thanks for being a truth teller in a world of lies God Bless you and the family at the blaze for all that you do\nFrom someone who lives and was born and raised in Honduras that is verifying exactly what we were we're being told what we had can do you know just as [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nYou know I was gonna say you know as reporters and then I was going to say no we're not really reporters and then thought of journalists 'cause they're not really a journalist but then I thought of ...\nHe's a he's a journalist with the Washington Post you know and it's that everyone keeps saying I I think columnist would be more accurate uh well he wrote five five five columns\nFor the Washington Post that of course makes you a journalist does it ... five ... I mean you probably written five ... columns out here to have places like the rest of ... I I did something for the Washington Post at one point to the gym I notice now you're a journalist or\nJournalists aren't doing their jobs the ... me news organizations don't want to tell you what's really going on but this is what's really going on with that care of and\nUm we hope to have Michael Yon before the end of the program today to talk a little bit about what they're doing about this in Congress and the Senate and what the president can do a and how we can hold Mexico accountable\nAnd these other countries accountable if they just pass their problem on to us\nI feel for on doors because these guys are the guys who are causing trouble in their own country\nThey're having to deal with these guys all the time\nAnd our press is not duped by them this is why it's hard to defend the press when they say we're not an enemy of the people yeah yeah I agree you're not an enemy of the people but you are definitely an enemy of the truth\nAnd whether that is intentional or you are just unbelievably a\nLacking all curiosity all natural curiosity you just start unbelievable\nAnd how a daddy inside you are on trying to find anything other than what people are just telling you in the next cubicle what'd you all just are agreeing on\nOh look if this bombs come in there's ten of them none of them have gone off they're they're they're not even pipes there's they're\nPVC pipes

metal not glass you put metal in these things\nPlus\nThe wires are on the outside and they go to a timer a timer why would you have a timer for something you have delivered through the mail\nThe wires are on the outside and they go to a timer a timer why would you have a timer for something you have delivered through the mail\nWhat do you expect somebody to open it up and then like\nI guess I should set this for two minutes that doesn't make any\nSense the kind of seems like that's what happened with um with the George Soros one someone else picked it up from his mailbox opened it up saw that it was some device\nWalked it over to the woods and put it down then called the police and the police came and blew it up right but I mean that's like if this was a a bomb that was supposed to be triggered by being opened\nDoesn't seem that to be that there's a timer on it you think it's a it's a time bomb but you don't sort of type ... through the mail\nI mean it's it's ridiculous very strange ridiculous uh let me go to Kim in Virginia who's a US mail carrier or hello Kim\nHey Glenn I'm actually from outside of Charlottesville\nOh what a hateful racist even those you know that I remember sitting I've ever I've ever been yeah well I I just want to point out that the guys who organized that in Charlottesville we're from Florida so just tell you\nThat my family I said my family

a moron or somebody who didn't want to do a lot of damage because the bees PVC pipe will be obliterated you want the pipe\nIt's the shrapnel that uh is important for the pipe or they also didn't put ball bearings or anything else and that they put glass which was not again not as effective\nUm if you're making a a pipe bomb they also had a cheap timer a wired to it why would you put a timer on

delivered\nSo this has happened before\nLater the next month of June eight bombs were set around the country in major cities did massive damage these were all to protest the anti immigration rules that had been put in\nThey were saying let's slow down on some of the immigrants coming in because we have to know if they're good guys or bad guys because we're bringing in a lot of people that believe in socialism in communism and they believe in revolution and we know what happened\nIn Russia we can't have those people come in here and that's why the communists the immigrants in this particular case were\nBombing when the bombs went off\nIt's interesting that everything there was a a note came with all of these bombs see if that sounds familiar it's as war yes class war\nBecause you were the first to wage it under the cover of the powerful institutions you call order and in the darkness of your uh laws\nIs that something that could be written by the left today\n\nIt didn't just happen once the next year September sixteenth Nineteen twenty the wall street bombing one hundred and forty three people were seriously injured thirty eight were dead\nThink of the impact at that time\nOne hundred and forty three seriously injured thirty eight dead\nThis leads me to if\nI'm ever in New York and people are have not been to New York there's a few places I like to take them and one place I always take them is twenty three Wall Street across the street is where George Washington gave his first inaugural address\nCross the street and the other direction is\nWall Street the New York stock exchange you know where that is then there's the building it's called the corner\nAnd it's a building if I showed it to you you would recognize that you've seen in a million times it was built in Nineteen Thirteen by a J. P. Morgan it was the morgue in house if you will his office was in there\nOne of the bombs went off right next to that building\nBut Morgan had built this classical building so deep and so thick that it didn't penetrate anything thirty eight people killed a hundred and forty three severely injured the bomb went off just off of the sidewalk and it didn't affect his building\nThere are ... marks from the shrapnel in the building look it up twenty three Wall Street\nSee the shrapnel on the side of that building the pocket marks and Morgan said we're not going to repair it\nLeave it there as a

the media today even\nKnow that story\n\nI can guarantee you nobody is telling you that story they're saying this is unprecedented and it has to be the right historically speaking it's almost always the left\nNow this might be the right this might be actually Republican because Republicans are known for not getting anything done or and so this guy built these bombs and built them in such a way that they were never going\nTo explode I don't know who built these bombs could be somebody from the left could be somebody from the right\n\nBut it's unusual that you could build this these this number of bombs and none of them\nWent off remember\nNineteen Nineteen twelve bombs were delivered twelve bombs went off Seventeen were not delivered Seventeen were stopped before they could\nGo off this time not a single bomb went off\nDon't think that sounds like a a great idea I think that could become a a lot of potential magnet I agree for bringing people here\nUm if the idea is to facilitate that Germany specifically the journey from somewhere else in Central America to the United states that could become\nMore of a problem again you you you nailed it quite a few minutes ago and saying that the humanitarian crisis that we have to be focusing on here really is the crisis with the refugees themselves\nHaving to make this long dangerous journey\nAnd then knowing that when they get here the odds are pretty\nHigh that they're not going to be deemed eligible for asylum in any event at just creates a whole lot of headaches for them in the process\nSo Mike I gotta I got an um an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras Honduras resident and then a born and raised native ah in Honduras\nSandman following the news or on the caravan here locally or been also a fan of your show watch your show and I have to applaud you and your intel um the origins of this migrant march this all wrapped it in in two thousand nine when the president of Honduras Manuel ... men well a little a a\nA lackey of Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro was ousted constitutionally by the other two branches of government ever since then we Hondurans have lived in chaos many of the things are have been tried by ... and his ... which translates to Freedom Party to destabilize our country\nLatest sons of ... blames America and has made America is now reaping what its own type statements he says that America must take into migrants because America has supported the current administration\nThat he claims is caused all the misery that we uh Hondurans are living through\nSadly the migrants have been lied to and have been told that America must accept them\nIn one news report a lady was interviewed a and she told the Honduran reporter that they were promised buses to travel on once they got to Guatemala but there were no buses waiting for them some of the migrants have returned home one twenty two year old man died in Mexico for reasons unknown as of yet\nWhat's really sad and frustrating is many of these migrants have been a toll that they will get in and they'll have jobs waiting for them when they arrived in America\nThere for many or good with hopes of a better life\nBut this is the type of situation that these criminals are who are the originator of this march will take advantage of\nSomebody's messing with them and we have to remember that most members of the Caribbean or ineligible for asylum or earlier this year or the department of justice clarified that you cannot claim asylum simply because your home country is unsafe by definition by\nLaw aside least face in individual in particular I danger in their home countries\nAnd because there's no legal basis for the vast majority of those in the caravan to remain in the United states ah we end up doing what we can what we can to prevent people from making the journey at all that but this this statement you just read is part of it is\nA narrative is false rhetoric that is perpetuating the problem and I think it needs to be called out as such just because they have a country that is a mess that it is a government that has made light unpleasant for everyone there\nIs not mean that any particular person necessarily has a valid claim for asylum in the United states\nMight have you heard have you heard anything talking to Senator Mike Lee have you heard anything about what Mike Pence revealed I think it was not yesterday day before I'm On\nA that Venezuela is behind the funding of of this\n[noise] um I had not heard that but ah we're hearing all the time different theories about who might be funding it ... that is interesting it's an interesting theory that Venezuela might be doing it begins Venezuela is broke Venezuela's perhaps a as broke as any country in the region right now\nAnd so that would really be something if they were doing it\n[noise] what do we do if they make it to the border Mike I mean they'll the Univision I think it's Univision is reporting that that number has no fourteen thousand I think that's hard to believe but you know even have five thousand people at the border what do we do\n[noise] it's um difficult\nTo say I hope and pray that it doesn't come to that because first of all think\nAbout what that would do it or already overwhelmed immigration courts or immigration courts are nowhere near getting ready to handle that kind of volume for nowhere near ready to be handling the kind of volume that they've already got\nA and so I I suspect that we will need to\nUm bring out a whole lot of additional human resources let's just say in order to make sure that our border isn't completely over run\nAnd that it doesn't just become a free for all for people to enter the country unlawfully we have no idea no ability to control who comes in once there is um [noise] and that kind of stampede coming in all at once so we've got to protect our border\nSenator Mike Lee last questions any any comments on um the the multiple pipe bombs that were delivered\nA tragic it's frightening I condemn anyone who uh who did it then I condemn anyone who says anything ah to applaud or encourage your support that kind of action\nUh this is I'm not something we can tolerate in American political discourse and I look forward to the day where we find that perpetrators responsible and I think they should be punished to the maximum extent possible under the law\nYou would classify them or let me rephrase that I Would classify whoever did this as terrorists would you classify them as terrorists\nWithout question without question and they need to be punished this\nWhere did this as terrorists would you classify them as terrorists without\nQuestion without question and they need to be punished as such ...\nThank you might
