I'm a I'm a housing structure of the Los Angeles housing that can really investment the primary referred me to a real estate agent uh and uh who who wanted to buy my property will eventually sign to California residential purchased contractor agreement\nAmong before we chose Castro emails me in order to stop work ... that the uh property had other purpose structure without permits\nOr hang hang on I'm a little confused let's set this up it was the housing inspector with the city who didn't referred you to a real estate agent how are you dealing with him\n[noise] okay well first of all when my mom died and my sister filed a complaint on the property saying that there was an approved restructured okay inspector\nCame out you don't want to didn't find nothing because of the cases oh by the way I have a friend who's interested in\nHow okay boy there's okay\nSo we're actually ... ah California residential porches agreement\nA month before we close bashful I received an email from the real estate agent along with the tandem to the purchase agreement we have agreed five hundred and twenty five thousand dollars he sent me an email says hey you know what I discussed a I had a conversation with the city's specter\nAbout the many issues this property has its worst so that I thought along with that email came in a dead end to the purchase\nFrom five twenty five to four hundred and eighty thousand becomes over and says you know what\nYou expect your you know if you don't think that it was the original\nGame offers because no cats are alright here let me\nFirst of all a that inspectors conflict it all over the place that's for starters I Would do with complaints straight out of high straight out complained to the city\nI did I just saw what complaints and there was a positive actions are using official position or off\nRight okay and you were I'm assuming you're sorry you were soon I'm okay good All right so that that works so have they moved it over to another inspector\nUh no I sold the property virtually stole the\nFall okay and you did All right so what's your what's your question so I Need to know if I can sue the inspectors I don't think so you know I'll tell you why because you accepted the ...\nEven though there was a fraudulent order to stop work uh got no issues now issues that are only had no issues with ... but you still accepted it ah you know what yeah maybe the city is a sure I'd give it a shot now it's not easy when you see the city\n'cause you're talking about suing them for and you're not going to get attorneys' fees back at all so you're suing them from what four twenty five down to forty five eighty five forty thousand dollars and a and that was hard offered correct\nCorrect he told me if you if\nYou don't get no I I get that that was but that was a hard offer was a an escrow been open already at five four and five and a quarter\nA yeah well it was a a month before we chose that story\nSo escrow was open at that time yes you're okay you know what I got to tell you it sounds like yeah I'd go for it I'd make a claim I make a claim a against the city for the money they are going of course he'll you know what I and then uh you um do we hadn't followed suit uh now I now you're gonna have\nTo pay for the lawyer uh I I don't know statutory early you are entitled to attorneys' fees I don't think so\nAnd then the lawyer will tell you what are your chances how much is going to cost you and then you simply ... via you simply decide which way to go it's very interesting case I've never heard of something like this happening but I said it's found solid to me as soon as I said you have to make a complaint and you did and yet\nThey fired the guy or end abusive his power yeah it's time to see a lawyer it's
