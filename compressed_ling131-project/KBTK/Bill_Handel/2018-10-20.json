Dennis\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\nYeah that's you're up welcome to handle on the law\nHello I'm Sorry Dave I Apologize oh that you and that's my fault hello there I Am the good morning that already Yes sir\nI have a a a pile of personal bankruptcy which will be discharged are completely next September in the meantime I'm In the middle of a cash out refinance on my personal residents\nAre almost at the end and so we're on a timeline a title search revealed that there is a second mortgage owed by a large bank or the title company will not fund the refile left that second is paid off outside of the re fi\nAh contacted the bank they said there was twenty five thousand note but they would settle for ten\nDon't know anything about this loan I've never paid on it I asked him to send me the records of the contract they said the records don't go back that far\nHow do they know you all the money\nThat was my question to them but it showed up on the credit report\nRight well that could be an era that could be an error\nI I understand that but they won't they won't provide any\nCroquet alone in the meantime the the brief I as being\nYeah yeah All right so I I think at this point I Would I Would do is get a lawyer letter over to them\nAnd if it turns out that they don't have any proof that you all the money is just hey you are with the money I Am because there was a letter or someplace there's some indication we have no backup what you're doing is a illegally interfering with my ability to get re fi ah and ah there's some there's some liability there\nWell understand that in the meantime though the locked in rates are going to\nCome here there's no question now rates are are are exploding oh there is no issue about it at all\nSo you want to work with your lender although the lender is going to do everything now that interest rates are so high would love to get you out of a locked in rate or maybe I they still want your business who the hell knows at this point and that because I don't know the anticipated the rates going up as quickly as they have been going on in the last few weeks and so you work\nWith them but this is where I I think you have to threaten or the banks saying you were holding up uh my rate which is locked in interest rates are now higher there some damages there and you just\nYou can't do that without proof but we don't have the records well then how do I know\nThe money well because you do I do that so that's\nWhy a letter from a lawyer and making a couple of demands would help\nIt would there be any advantage to waiting until the next September when the bankruptcy discharges to get us just the standard or a a conventional\nWell he ... on that well it's but juries are said to me what are they are two points higher yeah or you have to you don't want to wave\nYour rights on this one go for it gets a letter or an nail the bank if you can while I've ever heard of that happening and and\nJust that we're always money [noise]\nThe bank [noise] maybe there's a letter there [noise] there is no proof problem [noise] this is handling the law [noise]\n\nNothing small and not your [noise] your passion your hours your reputation huge partnership even bigger [noise]\nUm [noise] so that's where I Am\nRight and what are they are they finding new now or is it just screaming at you\nKnow finding me a hundred dollars a month or ... or because suddenly part and they expect you to take the window out I'm assuming\nThey're demanding I take the window out or else they would keep finding\nAlright has anybody else in the building or put windows in in those locations\n[noise] nothing All right so this is\nNew well I it's\nThey have the right to say no or are they have the right to say if you put one in a that in violation of the CBC in ours\nOr they can say ... and you take it out until you are and and then here's your fine and uh we're gonna keep on charging however they made it untenable for you to on the other side is that you wanted to put it in ... they made it impossible for you to even\nUh even make an application and there it is and they're ... by the way that there's the court case okay uh you have to ... ... what I Would do is have a conversation with the attorney that represents the board every every board of directors or each every age away has an attorney who represents a that represents them\nAnd have a conversation and say hey you know the board made it impossible the management company when you call me back\nWhat am I supposed to do well what you're supposed to do is just keep on trying and trying and trying and at some point I'll tell you legally what should happen even though it's the biggest pain in the ass you go to the point where they make an untenable and then you get\nA court order allowing you to do that because they made it untenable but that's way down the line so you kind of early on now it's a question of a what a pain in the ass the board is they're going to say hey we set up by the time\nWe set up a date you could've called us and found out it was eight o'clock or eight o'clock AM PM and you're going to say I tried yeah you never responded here's my phone call the management company and what you guys do where ... year playing chicken with each other\nSo I think it's a problem\nEternity for the board we're sitting right next to me at a board meeting well one of the border ms ... around ... ... ... what the window for putting solar panels on US military arranged it kicked the window out while a trip last\nOkay that incidentally uh if anybody else will\nUh will state that who's in the room now he doesn't have a right to do that by the way that's not a legal decision okay that's that's a board decision but that adds to your argument that's decent argument really is it's a tough one God has problems today that I don't so that works out hello Dennis Hi\nDennis are I'd want to know what they're up for me the courage to break a lead a we were renting a property that are flooded for time there's carpet in the bedroom that we've uh we've had over ... go and go on to dry them out\nOr we're going into the water and the wall also ah the water coming up from the flab\nAlright using all you do okay you just want out right I've you know they know that have they tried to fix it\nWhat they're doing is they're working on the ... very well aware that hit the outside\nAll right we're all wearing ... and you want out and you want out correct yeah All right well based on the fact that his untenable to live there is basically uninhabitable you say hey I'm outta here\nAnd I don't even know if you need noticed you just say it I just can't live here anymore because of what's going on thank you I'm done and then what I Would do is give this much noticed as possible\nOkay uh and now they're going to withhold a security deposit probably depending on the management company or they're going to demand some kind of a rent till the end of the leaves a I'm assuming you're do you have a lease\n... through may\nOkay uh so All right so you got a good long time so you let them know\nOr what you're going to do and uh they unless they're willing to repair inside right now and unless there are and they're saying but we have to do it from the outside in a then you can withhold rent whether you can leave
