have to pay tax\nYeah it depends on uh depends on the state I Know it depends on whether or not the feds are going to go after that that's number one number two it's over a period of years\nAnd is the uh is the\nFinancial institutions going even report they forgave the debt I think you're okay I really do the problem is\nUh do you say I've forgiven of this debt you say here's the amount I paid in interest I don't even know if you do that with a defense with filing an IRS a return if you talk about the amount of money that you paid in credit card debt\nOr whether or not you have negotiated a lesser payment but the bottom line is that yes that's considered income\nBut it's considered income over the three years so it's what sixteen Seventeen hundred dollars a year income to the change much I don't know if you get audited you'll be tab for uh eight hundred bucks income tax so I don't know if I Would do it or not and uh the answer your question would have to go to my accountant which will

welcome\nOh [noise] okay I'm gonna get right to it [laughter] okay I worked for an employer for about three years I left that implement about a year and a half ago and during the three years I worked for them\nI worked a considerable amount of overtime during last six months I worked in average in eighty hours\nPer week that's a lot wire ensue if you left the year and a half ago Tom why are you calling now\nWell that's part of my question I wanted to know a is there a time limit\nYeah there is a statue but you feel maybe within ah I I don't know if it's a year and I I don't have the statute in front of me uh but I think if you don't make the claim within certainly there there is a statute I just don't know one year six months whatever it is if you weren't passing time you're out of luck so the trick is for you to contact the state\nDepartment of industrial relations there was a whole section of a there's a whole section involved with wage enforcement and you can look on the Web site that will have a state of California and then the the department of dust relations and then frequently asked questions or there'll be some somewhere there they don't talk about a statute\nOkay yeah um can I can I ask you sure that question if we assume that just somebody told me it was three years okay it could be if we assume\nThat um you know I'm within the time\nI'm One of the things about it is um during the last six months that I work those eighty hours a week um the the manager of a wife a pass away that's all I stepped in and basically uh just just ran the show for them or during during that\nWell did they know you're working eighty hours yes\nAll right okay doesn't mean that it doesn't matter what for what reason you're working eighty hours\nWell the thing is that according to them basically a if you're a manager you get paid a salary\nThat's true that's true but you you reach a point where I ... I think eighty hours\nAt a news over as a a little bit over and over\nThe top here and you were not as you are not an hourly employee\nWell that's just the thing they never actually made me the manager several times\nWere you in our early in play doesn't matter if you took over management jobs were you an hourly employee\nDoes actually commission employee [noise] um that the commission\nOkay so your way out of body okay so your commission but you're still an employee correct\nIt was just based on commission um yeah I think you you get paid it's time for you to look at a website and if nothing else you talk to an employment discrimination attorney and see if anything's there because it could be pretty substantial\nSo you can go to the website you can go to the website and look for him to handle on the law dot com\nAnd I just look at attorneys do plenty discrimination those are the people that we look on that employment law [noise] this is handle on [noise]\n\nIn\nThe backyard looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding a deck to no one could contractors why don't you just ask home advice on what\nHome advisor dot com you just tell them about your project and they match you with local ... can do the job nice how much does it cost the home advisors totally free to use plus you can read customer reviews check pricing and book appointments\nFor free what's the website again home advisor dot com for just download the free home advisor at [noise]\nNothing small not your [noise] your passion your hours your reputation huge your partnership even\nPut down small business technology adventures and you'll get the ... and one on one partnership down your\nGround because of the reliable down the peace process news you can focus on what matters now getting business down\nBy down to speak with an advantage in southern by down\nMessage into your ... burning your degree\nMagic today [noise] eight seven seven by down\nMessaging to raise ... earning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might shot impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs checked companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line to find out more\nChecks scale to seven nine six four or five\nDash S.
