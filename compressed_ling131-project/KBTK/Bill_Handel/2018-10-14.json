[laughter]\nBig long story short basically what I found out where he went to his friend and they were trying to rewrite the software copy Michael basically and give\nA CBS a new version of this offer and they actually cut me out of the deal yeah how much money were you getting a year\nOr a thirty grand was the lead on my cousin gave me twelve and he'd keep [laughter] actually I got eleven like eleven thousand eight hundred different so how did it work that he got more money than you I was an idiot and the\nOkay yeah there is no good reason for him to get more money than you you were just in the country\nBecause of that now now in those four years I just want you know I was the one that they always caught tactic for the summer I Would go and do the right\nOkay so here's and so the bottom line you get to see who your cousin and your cousins defense is going to be hot gee we don't have any signed contracts your argument is going to be yeah but then why do we don't have a signed contract why did you pay me a over four years but what if\nWhat if I don't want to seem like and what if I thought I did I I spoke with the DEA is one of the restaurant next plane than situation unfortunately they're caught in the middle but I told him I owned the copyright that chocolate\nOkay so you're right and right now you're you're infringing on those copyright\nWell actually not because they're the contract or that they have and it's not CBS\nTo screw you is your cousin that's screwing you and I saw one has a written contract and you're saying there was a written contract between your cousin and CBS correct yes yeah\nBut in that contractor nowhere there is no car there's nothing that states I'm releasing my copy right\nYou have a lot but the point is that you're allowing him to use it it's not a question releasing the copyright it's a question if we we have a deal you can go ahead and use it a verbal deal you go ahead and use it so what do you want to do if you can't sue the kind of say what what would you like\nI Want what I Want to have you stop using the software\nI I don't know if you can you can stop it now you can make a motion to have CBS and then there was a lawsuit about interference with a contract that they may have but I tell you you go in to see a CBS you've gotta you've got a world of hurt and what are you going to do your you're going to send them at the cease and desist saying you can't\nUse the software anymore because uh I'm being ripped off and they're going to say we're not ripping you off you talk to your guns and but I don't want us to my cousin well that's true yeah general\nK yeah basically basically it's\nA law why wouldn't you want to sue your cousin who's growing you David because\nIt's good because it's going to cause more family problems I Believe you know [noise]\nI don't know if you're you are an idiot across several different levels I was going to cause a family problems if someone's stealing a stealing from me and I want to go after the wrong to where I Can't because it's going to cost family problems so they're going to get upset with me that's a rip off artist\n[noise] so I mean it is what it is [noise] this is handle on the
