I don't know who owns it but there's several people living in it because of the four or five cars I see out front\nOkay well there are probably the least water and the\nWay I can yeah unpacked or get a hold of somebody\nYeah Betty how old are you\n\n... pardon how old are you ready Ninety One are you really yes God you don't sound it day over Ninety Oh thank you all\nNow very yes and so you want to do this fairly quickly before you die I understand that [laughter] All right so bad that right yeah well good for you reaches humor All right so Betty or the trick is finding out who owns the property and ... that you can just pull title and it could be the bank or someone owns that property it with a re\nA lie understand so therefore the bank has it which is exactly as you want the bank to own it because then you contact or the bank and say hey clean this up\nGet rid of a though that hanging though those hanging branches now when I Would do is you've got to do it anyway at some point and a is there a danger your property I mean is there a wall that's being affected and\nThen there's the fence between the two properties that I understand I didn't get it for years and they understand it's a common than\nAll right well I that doesn't matter even if it's common fence or they're responsible for any uh trees ranch is hanging over your property so here's what I Would do I get a bad\nIn ah find out how much is going to cost if it were me I Do it myself I pay for it and then turn around and do those people but doesn't necessarily have to be that way I could simply finding out who I Am a ... and use a poll title and that that's easy ah that's just a in Internet search because these are all public documents\nAnd then you contact the owner now\nYou hope it's the bank because if it's still in the name of the previous owner\nI they're going to tell you to go pounds than they don't care I mean they're losing everything anyway I mean the worse that happens if you get a judgment against them let's say three hundred dollars okay just get in line\nBecause we've lost our house but he didn't got credit is like already\n[noise] their their distaste and our son took off\nA ... then you have to find out who owns a property 'cause that's where you going to go or you just paid for it and just suck it up I mean the people that are squatting next door they don't have any responsibility or how bad is your problem with this\nWell it it to the point I I haven't done I hadn't said anything to anybody 'cause I don't see anybody coming in and out but it it is a hanging over at least half\nIraqi are a lot how much do you think it's going to cost to clean that up\nWell I think it's quite large and the pine needles are about ... inches wrong\nOh yeah All right I got an issue I so I get a bad idea and I don't know how well how you doing for money are you living tape for oh\nGood All right because then the next question was going to be like are you living in a dumpster and is it nice and\nClean and uh so that's not the case I Would just pay for it and just have it done and then find out who owns the property and just send the bill oh okay that's and then a threatened same small claims court as I said if the bank owned that don't clean it up because that's just what they do I mean they're trying to sell the house and they don't want any liability and\nAh [noise] they're they're pretty good about that especially if you're talking small potatoes to two hundred dollars this phase handle on the last [noise]\n\n\n\nYou considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it seeps are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet\nYou know no matter of fact even if there were a negative and you give your name too though you give the hotel name out the what'd you can't do is make stuff up in a negative way this defamation or a or you can tell him what go ahead\nNo no go ahead yourself\nAlright so uh let's say a year accusing uh the hotel and having bedbugs in your story in the name of the hotel uh you know I don't want to name any names but Hilton\nMarian Wright Wyndham let's just go through the name it suddenly what was the name of the hotel\nOr can they want to say that on the air about why they don't know who you are\nAh well actually truthful and I'm not sure if I can imagine\nAre faring of a it's been it's been a few years\nYeah okay fair enough by the way they're ... if they couldn't go after you because uh there is a uh uh just to let you know you've heard of the attorney client privilege there is a there is a hotel talk show privilege that's recognized under the law so they couldn't have what\nLaws that what you got you know I don't like the way you can't remember which hotel I don't have it here in front of me uh when I'm sure it's there you know the point is is that let's say there was a horrible experience and you're a disparaging the hotel\nIf it's true but ah you know what\nThere is no defense there's no such thing as defamation to the truth is an absolute defense by the way they're not going to go after you if you say OK their bed bugs and the people were horrible and if you're talking about a non disparaging remark if you're talking about something that's positive that happens\nOr not only is there no disparage may not only is there in the lawsuit for defamation 'cause it's not defamation uh they're getting a commercial\nYeah that was kind of my take\nOut your way wasn't sure what what kind of book you write\nWell the first book with the travel experience a that was done and sort of a novelist\n... like in in real time you know strangely enough I probably didn't read it how did you do well we didn't do because we we put it on hold okay you're worried about language I understand you know wondering okay you're very lawyer\nUnderstand don't you don't have to worry about that uh because uh the fact that it hasn't been published yet there's not going to be a whole lot of difference when you publish it I uh-huh terms of sales okay what's your next book that you're working on\nOkay the the second one uh this is a book about a um a period of time in my life I guess you could call it a memoir or that takes place in Mexico ahah and part of it involves a very well known cancer clinic and Mexico okay and\nThere was an extremely negative scenario involved with this with this very famous cancer clinic and what I did and the second book is I changed the name of the hospital and all the doctors and and uh ... made it as unrecognizable\nIn their ... then you're going to do there's okay here's a little detail they're getting long part of\nMexico where it is it's the only cancer clinic and it's very well know\nAlright so big deal in the meantime here is ... I'm going to give you a reality check okay let's say there's defamation right ah and ah there's a it didn't happen there's legitimate you're giving a ... year issuing fascinating facts that\nAre are not true so now you they have a case to things have to happen number one ah people have to give a rat's about what happened to you and they don't\nWrite so uh I I wouldn't worry 'cause all three people going to read the book uh it really doesn't matter a number two ... they're going to be three people going to read the book uh they're never going to hear about it and if they do they're not suing you so don't worry about it enjoy yourself defame them\nI just have a time of your life couple of rules make sure it's I'm not you don't make up the facts and number two is as often as possible uh making your opinion\nOkay for example a it is my opinion that when they operate on me uh they took out my diaphragm but that shot my opinion\nI really don't know if they don't believe you can have a diaphragm well there you are okay thanks for the call is handle on the law\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThe sevens annual fall flooring yard sales going on now with incredible deals and lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to fifty percent off in stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents skin will look limited flooring all on sale up to forty percent off\nRefinished hardwood and bamboo starting at Ninety nine cents plus special financing stop by your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\nIs nothing small and how your [noise] your passion your hours your reputation huge\nYour partnership even\nWith ... technology and I just don't get the ... and one on one partnership dumped him in the ground with a reliable down PCs with ... you can focus on Mars now getting down\nTo having having by down to speak with an advantage\nIt will be peace and our core processor you can talk about what matters now getting down [noise]\nCollie seventh heaven by down because an advisor to hate them seven by down [noise]\nAre you putting your retirement savings in a four O. one K.
