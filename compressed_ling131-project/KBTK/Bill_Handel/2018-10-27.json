card with your name on it and you go ahead and you let the credit card company no that's not your credit\nHowever okay so you're probably get on that one the problem is that the money that he knows they're going to go after any community property money if he defaults\nOh and you both have community property you probably won't you probably everything you have is probably community property yes so here's the problem he's responsible for the community property so in the end you'll get nailed no matter what but\nSo here's the problem he's responsible through the community property so in the end

and it had a she got to recall though that\nThe airbag it the airbags we all know about that explode or set up shop now and he was in the dealer\nTo get it taken care of they say there is nothing they can do they have no way to repair it replaced it or do anything and for the time being which definite that nobody in her car\nYeah that's what they do Kelly because nothing you can do\nWell here's the problem there five million of those of you Kelly uh-huh and\nSo we're in line are you let's say you're the ... million person that walk in\nWhat they probably don't have thousands of airbags sitting in the back they can replace it\nCorrect and that's the problem so why you have to\nKnow how does that work do you have to find out where in line I'd go back to the dealer and say here's a recall and I'm assuming it's a knock at your bag correct I'm guessing yeah yeah I don't maybe want I contacted to knock people I Would contact lawyers involved with those people\nAnd I would go back to the dealer and said is there a time is there an estimated time when\nI my car will be be able to be fixed and they could say talk has never been told us when it is we know we have a recall we know they said they're replacing the bags but again Kelly there's five million people that have your problem\nOkay they actually told her there was no solution not even\nKnow that you know that's not true they can replace the airbag well that's how that's how we would all of them were having to go to another and go to Kelly go to another dealer oh okay yeah you can go to any yeah you can go to any deal or a

therefore there was no contract at all so interesting including the warranty once there was a breach ban everything is off the table\n[laughter] oh interesting okay and is that a specific California\nI don't you know I Am frankly I don't know because I just made it up [laughter] I saw it on me making it up is specific to California but me making up is probably across the country but I think I'm right on that one yeah okay I'll check it out yeah please thing that\nCame up in a a you know it wasn't the show all the time I'm like man is the perfect question\nFor you know it is and it'd be great if I knew about it [laughter] it would be wonderful and I should because I used to be a contractor\nSo I'm see it all works out\nMatt\nHi Matt erupt welcome to handle on the law [noise] Matt you there I'm here Yes sir\n[noise] okay I have had a house that I sold on payments that burned down in the ... California fires the blue cut fire [laughter] about three months ago I was effectively the bank [laughter]\nOh so you you you carry backed paper on it\nI carried back paper on\nCocaine and so the\nHouse to house burned down in the fires they did have insurance I was listed as as the additionally insured are right now it's up to my surprise which I found interesting being concerns company says they're going to issue one shack for the total loss\nIn both my name and the homebuyer Johnny insured name\nAnd it's up to us to to fight it out now I agree that I'm not going to say the check over to them and they've agreed they're not going to sign the check over to me so it leaves me in a rather precarious position\nWell and I I don't know if it does or not it probably leaves them in a precarious position 'cause they have to live someplace and you're still okay and so are you you can do a couple of things on this one\nAll right you can ask for mediator\nWere you guys pay for a mediator to work this out in a mediator who has experience in construction law\nMediators are generally attorneys who specialize in this field and then just sit down and work it out over a few hours that's one if it turns out that they're not willing to really sit down then what you do is you file a lawsuit for the money\nAnd then you do in ... you actually enter plead the money with the court\nSo here's a lawsuit to the court hears the check now let's go to work and the judge will make that decision and\nThe judge will issue in order and effectively the judge will sign the check on your behalf pursuant to a court order\nSo it's either a noun or mediator or a lawsuit\n\nAll right ah Hi rose rose You're welcome [noise] I got yes ma'am\nI had been with um my boyfriend for ten years you haven't done that for ten years ... he's finally getting caught together and if I may I in a life responsible for us\nBut first of all let's start with I don't know why would you marry someone who is such an honor flake that he has an filed taxes for ten years\nWhile he pays taxes they haven't found attack\nHow he'll wait a second just write the check to the IRS no I don't\nKnow I mean taxes come out of the ... nothing like that he does all that\nHe just had to file that site yeah he's probably entitled to some big refunds actually if you think of now maybe\nBut I'm Wondering if I marry him and my response though\nA hell you're only responsible for being stupid and um [noise] yeah well that's a given but I Know I mentioned Carson I Love you and I'm not that\nThey see there you see the will lessen well we can have that conversation can we are because I did we talk about your boyfriend now or soon to be husband you're not responsible\nOr perfect but you have to be a little careful when you marry someone who is financial issues\nJust keep everything separate everything separate and I and and what I mean separate is everybody has totally separate bank accounts and you have a shared bank account that then you write household checked out of\nThe mortgage or a gardeners or utility bills or whatever\nAnd so that is the cleanest wait now as far as he is concerned having pay the taxes and not filing tax returns now that is a violation but it really isn't a big deal\nThe IRS doesn't really carry just file their taxes and now you may even be entitled to he may even be entitled to refund so I even though this violation and it's one of those and not paying taxes they get very upset\nYeah now he painted then you're fine and then just say hey I didn't file their taxes that memory lapse for ten years and I don't\nRemember and I woke up by ... long beard and rip family or whatever whatever\nBut uh I haven't gone to an accountant file their taxes damage and get a refund okay\nI'm often now okay now you're in the primary\nUh Michael hello Michael a welcome to handle on the law\n[noise] probably about a month ago we had water damage or capture a result he could

all you can do\nSo I I just wanted to make sure the ... the low ball\nUsually not to that extent or pens on the insurance company it really does or so it ... the insurance companies run all the way from miserable and horrible\nTo really terrific where they go out of their way to the adjuster to not only help as much as possible but then called back\nAnd say is everything okay I'm Mr handle I'd had a couple of those ah you clearly don't have one of those\nDisappeared for three weeks\nCarlos I'm only yeah you've got you've got an insurance company\nYou have to deal with all you can do is fight it I Am a ... at the end you may end up having to to even take your own insurance company to ah to court and all you can do is go to a supervisor level and scream and rant and you can screen bad faith uh but that's that's a tough one\nAnd so you're you're sitting there with ouch odd without a kitchen correct or five months\nFor five months I while they're negotiating while they're doing all that that's part of the lawsuit I think that's very good that's a bad faith all over the place so either you have a couple of choices first thing I Would do is contact\nA bad faith attorney and in a civil attorney who deals with insurance companies and see if I Do read the policies if you have anything they're they're all kinds of exceptions to mold or in many cases insurance companies will not do mold abatement you're sort of on your own on that one\nUh it's it's a question of your policy it's a question of are the adjuster it's a question of the company that you're dealing with\nAnd uh of finding a lawyer that can look at it and we started\nThreatening I mean that the the only good news here or is that you and not me either [laughter] you know and it could it could be a lot worse and a
