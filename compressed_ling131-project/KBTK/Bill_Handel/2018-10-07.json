I Can't imagine the Belgian law is going to supersede\nA California law in terms of property so which they so let's say you have the property laws here community property whatever it is right ah in test to see where a wife and the kids split up money equally if there is no well I I don't care what it is you're someone told you that Belgian law\nCan come in and say our law says Seventy five percent goes to that person therefore you have to let our law even though we live in the United states even though the properties in the United states no no it doesn't work that way you got someone gave you the wrong advice\nAnd tried to call from what I'm saying they are to fame with his style\nIs a mess in California we have a friend and then another one and Murray who is a guy who\nWell that seems to me and thanks yeah yeah that's new to me I Can't I don't understand it by the way are you ah are you an American citizen here and they can then that's crazy\nThen that's crazy I mean that's completely insane so you're saying Belgian law can come in and say for Americans to a citizen only property in America\nHaving children in America pursuant to American last weekend come in as a a Belgian or we will bring our Belgian law over ... doesn't work that way John Claude\nDoes not now now wherever you guys had advisors crazy he's probably a wall loon you can look that up to\nIt's a\nForm that she speaks posing as a great place by the way fabulous rather a chance to go to Belgium just wonderful although they do they do great French fries but they eat with mayonnaise it's so bizarre they dip their French fries and mayonnaise the way we do catch up it's just very strange\nUh go figure All right David Europe\nOr a question from my dad\nOr my his wife and my step mom for Thirty years she recently came into a settlement uh about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars she took the money moves out of the house that they were living in together and bought her a and other health a couple of days away a cash money and I was wondering does he have any\nType of okay what settlement what kind of settled law she\nShe got to tell them in for injury\nIt's ... it's hers has he has no say he has no right to it especially if it if it's just her name she bought a house and her name\nYeah she didn't put it in his name right no he has no right to it it's all hers yup oh that's a that's not considered income that's not a commute that's not community out that if you earn money then\nIt's community a community as to which means that the husband or wife depending on who gets the money he's entitled to half of that\nIf it is a personal injury or that's being settled nope ah that's separate property if it is inherently since it's separate property so ah the dad gets no money\nWhatsoever or Tony\nHey Toni welcome to handle on the law will get you for you\nKnow my wife has let her daughter who's twenty thing at her two kids moving or how how long do we have worked as renters right\nWell it's a question of the reasonable mess of your daughter coming in how long is she willing to go the other way how long has she been there\nAbout a month now nine months isn't going to do it nine months has no problem you can she can throw around there is no renters writes there she just temporarily letter move in and it's a family issue I don't think she has the right you can just throw it out so we're looking\nAt a map of having her there six months\nI don't know why is whatever's reasonable under the law but I don't think uh you know a couple of three months and but I think it's six months yeah it's it's a rental situation\nAnd I think she has certain rights and I don't know the difference being bringing in family it's about the same yeah even if they don't pay for it they're still tenants so on you wanted you know what color landlord tenant attorney to get the exact time which I don't think there is an exact time\nAnd he said he took it over and that you signed it right he actually accepted the contract okay\nOh then identified at least interests have about a year ago and said\nRomney nine years yeah I\nCan't do this because they can pretty much a gesture here and they they can\nI can find a good lawyer even while I got a lawyer but then I'm looking at all of them at very scams\nOh yeah yeah most most of those people who are you at a time shares Laura ... or ...\nI don't even know what I did one hey I Know and ah I ... and and here's the\nProblem I've been asked to advertise or various ah of these organizations and I've always opted out I've always said I Know I I'd rather\nNot he can be done how it can't\nThere are specialists time share the people that are the worst exit is thrown in there you know ... removal et cetera or it's just you have to be very careful a lot of yo previews\nA lot of looking at the contract they want money up front or that you want it all up front and then they say with a guaranteed within Eighteen months so that would touch with a ten foot barge pole\nOr what they're doing yeah of course that's\nAny worse yeah and you know I I told him I said well my mom and she said I Need\nBut that doesn't matter the point is that your brother I accepted it\nRight but you can you can sell it but that doesn't mean you're not responsible okay sorry example let's say um I bought a car\nAnd I'm On the hook for a car and I sell it to someone who's about to go bankrupt wow the company doesn't care yeah big fine soldier wherever you want we have a lean on the car you know we use still owe us money\nWhere it is you know it\nDoesn't matter it's like that that is interesting so are you ... that that makes it a little better for you because they no longer do sales of land anymore now its point now you won't nothing\nOr what you're gonna have to be you can't just walk out you can't just sell it and therefore say I'm not responsible because then you start with someone who can't pay and you're off the hook doesn't work

I Know yeah that that money is wash for sure\nHey Daniel you're up we're going to do for you\nKnow um I had reached out we have to give you my credit card or a hotel room it was over [noise] um before I ate my friend the credit card number I contact right right well yeah that had like a right to charge for anywhere\nUp to ... thousand dollars that we can do a maximum of five hundred dollar\n... and I said I read provide my credit card number or new days later I when I log on my on my credit card account and noticed that there was a forty five hundred dollar\nI immediately contacted the credit card company that hey look you know write them forty five hundred dollars and I've seen the heart or by on\nThat stage they they\nLook you know that that was on any item thing however wanted accurate won't be level and that's why when ... when the host and it was over a thousand\nSquare outlay you days later I logged in my uh online and out and there was another man in charge of the day motel were over seven thousand dollar reach out all the credit card company again that hey look there they are heroes thousand dollars\nIt is is being used right now I only five hundred dollar of which there was already out Groberg them I'm Amazed that they needed that you know there's nothing we can do with it and in charge and then what did your vendors already charging what they can they want\nAnd at the end of the day there was overwhelmed\nOh and your friends spent twelve thousand dollars of one hotel for a while but yeah there was a friend there was a friend of yours brilliant\nExactly my question to you is that when I reach out to the credit card company or get providing right from the credit card number and they gave me the or the no more than twenty five hundred dollars would you charge and then\nLater on we'll all be All right we're driving every\nYeah you do and here's the problem you're going to have though and that is a they're simply going to deny it oh we didn't see that our our policy has led us to do that and I wish you and sent an email\nOr to the credit card company but I don't know how many people would actually do that because you know your friend you didn't know your friend was the the uh you\nTo come for their word and so I'm not I'm not going to call you an idiot on this one because I think a lot of people would have done the same thing I I probably would've done the same thing so you're entirely you retire issue is\nUh that uh the credit card company I told you that you're only liable to twenty five hundred dollars that's all they're gonna charge and then you started arguing them you just do everything right down the line now are there I'm Sorry go ahead\nAnd taking those steps that you are in through their quote unquote investigation they come back and said you know what we're going to stand by those hard and your whole life\nOr what did they what did they say about the twenty five hundred dollar limit conversation\nUh when I when I discussed that with them with representative I spoke with several conversations with different and tried to climate change within the mark up with some of them said oh you know it's unfortunate that there is representative made a mistake when she authorized only up to twenty five hundred dollars but you know what it's her mistake\nIt was like ... commits Harlem mistake and it doesn't matter that she works for a it's a mistake come on give me a break on that one now I is there any record in your file that says twenty five hundred dollars a limit have you talked to anybody to look at the no\nDoubt that they are going to look at them no yeah you get on this when I said look obviously all your all your phone conversation recorded\nRight on the purposes and\nI got through to one of the managers and she acknowledged that there were several Congress Asian that she went back and listen to and I could tell that are hotter here on the phone call as you can understand where I was coming but nonetheless her paycheck also comes from the company\nI'm so sorry about that recording this so I received a letter from if I could have an audio recording that obviously the answer was no right but I\nThink a lot or in the mail there were conversations only or different days and so it's documented on their\nLead writer so you've got so we're going to happen is going to turn over the collections you're going to disputed\nA collections are going to dean your credit and at that point unfortunately I'm you're going to win that you just tell him sue and sue me just go ahead and to me uh and we'll talk about this I Will later on\nWhat you have to worry about is your um is your credit\nYeah not that this was a ... year because of where I was making the payment on a credit card\nWait a minute have you gone over the twenty five hundred dollars I have not no no that's why I'm reaching out right I didn't like here's here's the only advice you go up as far as you can in the food chain\nI and die if you've done that and\nJust keep on going over and over again find out who the vice president is in terms of stupid employees or that put a lot more on a credit cards and they should there ... there are certainly a vice president that does that somewhere in the system and at the same time I had the collection well once you uh I Would cancel the cord\nAnd and just get right into it and say hey because what's happening is you're paying interest on the entire amount\nAnd you're going no place and that's just stupid to pay interest on twelve thousand dollars and all you is twenty five hundred dollars so I you just I Would stop paying let them know you're stopping the payment based on this you're disputing I'm assuming you're turning over the collections I'll be fighting that\nAnd there will be legal action taken if you're being my credit and if you try to collect that simple and then I Would call and you may even want to go to a lawyer a collection lawyer a debt a twin ... yeah just collections layer\nAnd die by an hour of time or just ask\nI Am I doing everything right and we are I mean I don't know anywhere anywhere else\nTo go fighting credit card companies
