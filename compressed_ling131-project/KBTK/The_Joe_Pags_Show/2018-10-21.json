Y. been have you on the rise makes lumber stopping by\nEach one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty about eleven or twelve minutes away from a wrong decision to use running for governor of the state of Florida use the former congressman he's a Republican from guy and he's the guy who was it would be very good for the state let me go to the phone lines in the meantime stay a little walking belonged to each Romeo injections Romeo what's going on\nHey how's it going to show ...\nAll right oh I was talking about the result\nOf Elizabeth Warren as low as they are yeah\nWell the possibility that ... would take a DNA test will probably have more interested in him than she did\nNot I think it would be Romeo I think it'd be hilarious I I Wish that he would do that I think it would be Leary is\nYou know I I Know it probably won't happen but it's just the thought of it is just hilarious yeah\nAbsolutely right no listen I agree with you I Hope that he would do that I I I really do I think that that would that would really shut her up I was so weird to be that she thought she was somehow vindicated or or saying something that would shut him up I mean it would be hilarious he returned to president Donald Trump\nHas more I'm Native American all American Indian blood ... when she does one one thousand forty fourth\nAnd again that is less on average than the average white American now\nYou're just putting it out there is going to be said who is on line three in Texas I say what's going on\nI guess kind of fire why there are five paying for purple at ... main nationality ... you know our our how chair and when you make an application\nI think that you need to stop paying down what you are and get flavor I'll find it catch this hour about rifle fan and I find it kind of pick half an hour and all the things that happen to hand we need to pass a law that employers cannot you face background check\n... against employees\nBecause that's what a lot of them are doing today and it had a lot of these things are ... they found anything hair it happened here you have to be cod catch ... against our employees and it's not right\nHey I got you and I appreciate it very well said open line now one eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty Joe ... going to be generally who is in Ontario, Canada Jenna what's going on I\nI Do find he got a I I Try to get through to Russian I just couldn't do it so I Try to you and they got to\nSee that Russia is way more important than I Am that's what's going on\nYeah good well I think the uh Trump part of the Republican Party should start talking to the snow like these guys that are set in a hundred thousand dollars a year for education\nIf the Democrats get back in there they're going to be working at a fast food though because they'll stop they'll stop all the jobs and everything else or put more regulation follow Trump fair to discuss going\nI'm a Trump fan or Seventy bucks\nI could have gotten more but uh but anyway I think\n... you from wanting to be one Seventy dollars yup yup\nWell anyway okay ah\nAh in Canada we have the same kind of a form it's close to the sewer but ah they have everything is left wing your holiday TV station\nAll newspapers all left wing liberal and our prime minister his qualifications when he ran was a he was a a surf ... constructor and grammar teacher\nAnd the only reason I think he got in it because his dad was prime minister Canada and that started a down trend in Canada and I think I think a lot of people are thinking about\nNow awfully proud and marijuana idol for how was the army for\nTwenty one years I'd move there either so I think the only reason he got in it because of the marijuana thing\nOne of the matter is that I think you're right about that I also think it was because he was a good looking guy I mean that's not a big czar today if you're a good looking smooth talking person no matter how stupid your bedroom relatives or people will vote for you it's very very odd\nWell if you listen to me it's not that good of a that good or a spoken as some people think he's got all everything in there too or if he asked to a talk without a proper than he is not that good\nWell I Know that he did it all mankind which are really exposed them to be the do the study is all he um some you know young lady who are in the audience said somebody about mankind oh what's your we said people time and he was dead serious leader he said he was joking when he was dead serious when you watch that video\nI Know he uh he I think the people who's a school in her country after people behind them because I don't think he's smart enough to do and he has to listen to them and uh he's not a\nYou'll probably get it again and again like I said our newspaper's not have a radio station you don't have a conservative newspaper because Africa ... TV station we had one is called the sun and they got rid of that\nSo you know where in worse shape than uh you guys are at least you got Fox News and\nI hear your voice wants to be about Newsmax TV which I'm On Monday through friday or receive calling you interesting always be here from people from different countries as to what they're facing compare to what we face you you're going to be Richard executives rigid about a minute begin to have and let's go\nServices Richard gr west Texas cool\nI Love your Richard ... got got got\nLess than a thousand dollars go a few years back uh I can get another really bad cough and several people rally headed up in love with hearing aids\nCaliber scholarly type it's very search all he finally came to the conclusion of what we had was whooping cough or or ... and I'm Sorry we're\nAnother vaccination against that he said yeah but when we got to him about our late twenties early thirties ... all we've all been walking around up here for the last you know forty Thirty years with me or the middle east will come up and down there and they're begging that stay with us one of them and I guess what happened in ...\nWell I Believe in Texas for Thirteen Years now I don't have open golf so I don't think it's not everybody Texas getting it that's for sure um but yeah ... ... as we said earlier if we're not doing full medical screening on people who are coming here and if we're not stopping those who are trying to come here illegally from coming in only loud and those were coming legally\nWe're gonna we're gonna phase the potential for\nA health issue that should not be\nThe smartest let's be real it's a one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty one to see just running for governor of Florida when we come back there\nYeah he's the weekend with geo down [noise]\n\nRules for alerts in office the automatic text messages to reach me implies\nA total of indivisible capitals so when you look at some of the voters\nWho that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway in areas that may be a Republican wouldn't 'cause the Democrat even though their party has drifted more and more anti Israel in Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't this time they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really align with the radical left\nA which is really a very hostile to Israel now\nWell he's a he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and it'd be government he's also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants\nMedicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's it's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to be run it in I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person generally speaking is Catholic or Christian who is some former lifters loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy I don't know that day that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic voters not monolithic I mean in Florida you know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics than in South Florida um and it's just different than I think what you would see in Texas or California\nUm and then of course in central Florida you know we had a burgeoning population of people who are Puerto Rican I've been very involved in a lot of those issues I'm actually endorsed by the sitting congresswoman from Puerto Rico\nOr who's a Republican and a friend of mine and so I think that the\nReason why Florida we're doing good it because we're producing economic opportunity\nAs Republicans I mean we're below us ... unemployment and the history of our country and it's hot and I think we can do even better in Florida\nYou can do that though if you do what Gillum wants to do which has raised taxes forty percent a single payer health care you know on and on it does\nThat would really be the end of Florida's economic momentum so I think a lot of these are\nReally across the border looking at it and say you know I Want to be able to have a good job I'm going to be able if I work hard to be able to get ahead well clearly if that's what you're looking to do that on your guy because I'm going to build upon that success Florida has has had economically I Am not going to tear it down with can fifth get tore pots policy\nIt's run run as soon as he used a Republican running for governor of the great state of sort of a former congressman from down there but let me talk specifically about school school safety you know that I'm a good friend of a republic will course tragically lost his daughter middle ... high school in February fourteenth that area of the state was put on the international map\nAs ground zero of gun control versus you know armed guards at the schools\nOr you've got people on school boards like this guy Runcie who is a promise program Obama guy who will ignore the the violent criminal history of students just said that they don't have a a record when they get out of school for some reason\nOr what can you do should you become the governor I Hope that you will become a governor rethink your gun but what can you do from that offers from that position\nTo stop allowing sheriff like Israel to turn a blind eye to a bad guy who could walk on campus and kill a bunch of people to get people off school boards like ... who is going to ignore criminal records of people like this Eighteen Nineteen fifty three fifty eight I don't see his name I see his\nHis prison number what can you do from that position from the office to shore up our schools and guaranteed her kids are gonna come home at the end of the day\nWell if you have to weigh Florida works as if you have and if they're so like the Sierra who's elected countywide or the governor can remove them from office um and I said after Parkland\nIt off just seeing a share of Israel though on CNN blame other people\n... for the cameras not be honest with the people a Broward County I that is if I were the ... and I would have removed Israel I think that was the appropriate thing to do with I'm In the\nNavy I I'm a former navy by right when the when the ... of ground the captain of the ship\nIt's held accountable that's just the way it is all Israel was saying hey I gave the guy a badge what am I supposed to do not my problem that's not leadership that passing the buck\nRight and I thought it was disgraceful the way he handled themselves so that is one tool you have but obviously I'm working with the end the\nPolicy as well to make sure that we do what we need to do legislatively asset at the school districts are able to protect their students\nAnd some school districts will do a much better job and I think Andy had a lot of problem are getting the Broward school district is heavily bureaucratic a lot of very left wing ideas\nFor listened to read and he was trying to elect a new school board members so that they couldn't remove runs the Exxon and they they narrowly lost so is the you know it just I was disappointed to see that because I agree with you run sees policies helped facilitate what happened in Parkland\nIran would you leave it in a guy like really judge in Polk County to just want to be a guide to other counties he's doing great work there as far as school safety goes\nAbsolutely I ... we were in ... county couple of days ago grade he endorsed me with a bunch of the other ... that's a huge huge job plus for me in this race that almost a unified the court of law enforcement throughout the state of Florida partially because I've been very strong in support of them and have a\nWealth or the other what do I mean it's usually hospital for the men and women the law enforcement and they ...\nBe strong in support of them and have a great up all the all the yellow me usually hospital all men and women the law enforcement and they were allowed to eat dinner they're going to have a target on their adopted that he will get my dog we we will use law enforcement of the political football\nBag review it's a round as soon as Republican running for governor would reach beautiful in regards to Andrew Gillum let me just give you some quick shifted about a minute that we have remaining I really appreciate your time run a taxation that looks like a tax cuts to point over on deck here\nIf the house you go to the Democrats that's not going to happen as the governor of a state would you support the president if you lower taxes\nAs ... people in the United states\nBam right [laughter]\nWell that was that was pretty quick I'm already a pro life obviously argue for defunding Planned Parenthood even on a state level\nSo yeah so absolutely\nUh when it comes to this caravan of illegal immigrants come into our border what should we do we just keep on giving you know because I Know the government wants to give a path to citizenship for anybody who could speak across the border where you do\nSeveral of them he wants to abolish ice and he wants to open borders or get on with\nThe ... to just be able to go in that foreigners get to determine who comes to our country not read the American people look I think the president are use whatever tools radically disposal I think the Caribbean needs to be turned back we've got to insist on the rule of law you can't have people just bargaining end of the country I'm In the middle of the border\nJust doesn't work and so I Know the ... monitor that I think he will take some sort of action or and I think if you can turn the caravan around I think the debate that we stopped and mad at our southern border\nIf you were the governor yesterday to send National Guard from Florida there to protect our borders what'd you\nThink it would depend on what the need for like obviously we have a lot of them be helping with the hurricane\nRight now after a lot of this may not be the best time for it but if I had a free our resources that that that some free time\nI think it is important because that when the drugs come over the border you know that affects Floridians I mean the fence and all these synthetic opioid a big problem in our state and I think that if we're able to turn that back that would be a good thing\nI Know that age will join us for equalizing schools and education by by forcing more taxation and more public schools use against each school vouchers are you for or against vouchers\nOr we have we have a hundred and thirty thousand kids many of them were income on various scholarship program rank you want to and all of it right or those I think that they're successful\nAnd they're in a variety of different ways whether it's low in top whether special me whether we have a scholarship program for kids that are already been school so their parents can find a safe environment Andrew would cost a scholarship and force them back in the school where they're being bullied so he has very ideological about that even though the program\nThe work you would literally pull the rug out from underneath the spammer\nVouchers scholarships like this obviously expert actually help lower income people white left would be against it as not to be running I really appreciate your time and how busy or the Republican running for governor the great state of uh of Florida it's wrong to see it as opposed to again OK\nOkay thank you\nWe appreciate rumble Sanders pick of the time he was on the road and we did it live during my program on friday a really great apes or is there not to use the right guy from Florida and again I've got a very close personal ties in with my mom still lives there I grew up there and do it again you've got a decision
