Seventy eighty Joe ... dot com glad to have you on the right\nThe one thing that we haven't talked about\nIn in at least a day day and a half is this caravan coming from um a Central America you know it's interesting to me how people get really backed out of shape about words stopped drawing in a caravan it's not as an invasion\nWell not at our border so they're not invading us they certainly invaded Mexico Mexico welcomed with open arms they come on through\nMexico should be offering all of them politically asylum and all of a refugee status in and keep 'em settled right there which is interesting is that Mexico in Mexico but national language is the same language most of these people allegedly speak and I say allegedly because as as much as the media's reporting all from our doors they're not\nThere were reports from within the ranks of those in this caravan or horde of people\nThat I'm Better for the middle east I mean the reports that there are people from the middle east in metal edge caravan\nSo we'll talk about that but we haven't talked about it at all for a day and a half two days we've been distracted by what's happening with this alleged bomber no of course we have what's going on at Pittsburgh which is a very important story to keep an eye on the reports of social media now\nYou know about this alleged shooter was and I'll give you a hint not a Trump fan okay not a Trump fan now would that gets out of it is true you'll see what the media is going to do they're not going to say the\nEntire Trump shooter that are going to say the Trump haters shooter they're not going to say the far left wing um you know liberal supporting built in the blank that they'll they'll just say the shooter the alleged shooter\nThey won't use any descriptions other than that with a bomb or the alleged bomber he's the ... the Trump or targeting bombers all this stuff which is of course irresponsible and not journalism\nYou just to let you do and and I love you guys when I say that I mean I Love you know a girl a anyway I'm\nDoing this show for what eight eight years something like that now the Joe ... shows Monday through friday it's on radio station been doing that nationally syndicated for three years of other shows eleven years old I'm idle do conspiracy theories\nI Do believe that people conspire and try to make you think something different out but then what actually happened I get back that's real and in history that is certainly happened okay\nBut I'm not going to have you you know call in and say I think it's a false flag and the Democrats were losing so they needed something somebody just out of their ashes\nHold this guy in Florida gamma ray and with a bunch of crap on it and have them send out what what those who brings a false why would call a fake bombs\nThe reason why I'm successful other than it's a damn good show is that what do they talk news and want to report the news to you and we'll be breakdown topics I always base it on fact\nIf you base it on fact you're always going to be safe if you start speculating I can probably take calls for three hours would you guys telling me what you think happened when it comes to the alleged bomber I ... I Can't play that game so that we go on facts what do we know\nWe know that he called himself a a a self a couple of different names first they've always Caesar\nWould either ... or ... or whatever we know that the guy had some ... a bunch of weird stickers on it we know that he's got an extensive criminal record we know that he was a Democrat until twenty sixteen when he allegedly switched to Republican\nWe know that he's a wannabe bodybuilder window but his family says that he's delusional when nobody's presented himself as an American Indian I'm a seminal to be exact\nIn South Florida ...\nWe ... we know that also is\nAllegedly who's the lawyer for his family I couldn't bear voters his lawyer but I'm was on NPR or something like that he was actually Phillies actually pulled up you don't want to tell you who knows I don't know what I Do know\nUsed the FBI says these were real devices [noise]\nThe FBI says yes\nThey were really we're not a hoax they could have detonated thank goodness they didn't\nActually go and what you say I have to go with the facts are the FBI says that's what it is\nUnless you're telling me if he FBI was in cahoots with a false flag that where they found this guy out of their butts I just said hey look here's the guy what's changed the election\nI can play that game it's a one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe packs dot com or the writer\nThere is the weekend armed with geo ... on a\n\nMessage to raise ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nFrom what I've learned from watching ... when al ... Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like pd and others um is that when you walk up\nYou generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was a but again if somebody's going to get with the program you probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on 'em\nAnd but they're also minor enough to know where you could still get them home tonight I mean that's it's kind of it's I didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look\n[laughter] just relax you know this is going to go a lot more did a lot differently than you think if you just stay calm was work through it um and it does give us the ability to use some of that discussion but you're right and if we wanted to we get stuck on a ton of charges to do it it really just depends on on where they want to take it\nBut when I get pulled over and ... and you don't know what kind of ... but when I get pulled over and it's often a I hey have my hands are ten and two of Gadhafi's sunlight on the window rolled down and I'm thinking ... who's the man or woman just walking up you know for for the survey the community sometimes that helps me sometimes it doesn't I have had a chicken or two in my life\nBut it also helps having a radio and TV show just like to say hello to the officer on the air and that seems to get me somewhere too I'm sure mark lamb or should we talked about this in Washington how close to the ... county are you on the border\nNow we're not on the border we're about Seventy miles off the border and we\nHave an Indian reservation that Donald immediate nation that's on the south into our county a very big Indian reservation that actually runs all the way to the border and across the board awhile part of a reservation in Mexico\nAnd so it's a very unique situation that's one of the or their community is is a ... been opposed to a wall across their reservation\nWhich split the slick them apart yeah\nYeah and so and that's one of the agreed that would split their reservations apart and so what happens is is that there is only a three strand barbed wire fence across that area and that's one of the top spots where it's easy for these people to come across it's about a six day hike through the desert\nUm unless somebody a there's a coyote that transports him in a vehicle upright who\nSo about five miles south of the I ... interstate is where the reservation in\nAnd they have that five miles spot where they have to try to get across\nA lot of people over ... on the other side on the reservation the states would be responsible for charging for any drug to cash right now we have a they typically have a five hundred pound ... marijuana so you don't have more than five hundred pounds which any individual backpack or only probably as thirty to fifty pounds right and they do that\nAnd so they wait till they'll sit right on the edge of the reservation when they think it's a good time to make that last five miles Bush because if they get caught and put out county they're going to get charged with state charges and that's where the agenda\nBut what could we would you bordering right on the news on this uh um Indian reservation I'm guessing you have to cooperate with them do they cooperate with you I I Can't imagine they would want four thousand illegal immigrants on the reservation overnight\nYou know they're good partner um\nPeople don't want to end up on the reservation there's no jobs there's not a lot of job opportunity there so they want to get the scenic because there is a lot easier for them to get all over the country so their goal is not to stay on the reservation I'm although I'm sure some do\nNow their goal is to get up to the I ... interstate so they can transport the humans and the drugs that's the cartel that's what I tried to tell people all over this country is it's not about this guy come into wanting to work in this country ... about or tell controlling human trafficking and drug trafficking in our country\nSo quite literally if I'm if I'm geographically getting it right in my head if they get through the the reservation the first time they step in to the United states would be in your county\nCorrect yes our county now our county goes quite a few miles into the reservation as well right I was a big portion of the county of the reservations in our county but where it really starts to affect those bringing the drugs and the human trafficking\nIn ... about that five mile mark when they get into to where they can be charged in ... county and then the state of Arizona\nIts share of mark lamb he of course Panetta County Arizona you may or may not have seen them on on live t._v. which I loved it hopefully you guys will be on there and getting sued 'em for me\nWatching the caravan of two to five thousand people none of whom really need political asylum they've actually said we're going there for a better what we want we want jobs you want whatever you know you and I are are are good guys we we want people to have a better life I'm Glad that my my grandfather immigrated here from Italy legally ah when you see an influx like this\nAnd it's also very close to to the election there's probably a political slant to it do you work closely with ice your close you would be a gesture your closely with the White House who do you work with seeing this massive people\nWho may be heading into your county soon what do you do to prepare for something like that\nYou know I was actually a on a phone call about three weeks ago with a our eyes director because you know we have done to hear nice uh\n[laughter] but I thought about three weeks ago at ... the director of ice here in Arizona and we were talking about this issue about this this large group of people that was coming I like you shenanigans or going on to those ...\n... I've been in these foreign countries these these they're small villages to rally this many people something something behind\nUm regardless of that we still have to deal with the problem right even the whatever regardless of how they got here who's behind it they're still coming on our doorstep and we're having to deal with it um and it's a tough situation\nI'm like you like you said I Want people to come here I Want you to make a better life but then again you have to follow the rule that's what we're asking is Solomon\nI'm like you like you said I Want people to come here I Want you to make a better life\nBut then again you have to follow the rule that's were asking us follow the rules that are set for they're not coming for political asylum if they were they were stopped in Mexico right there really cover to get into America and this is a push to the dangerous thing about this court\nIs as they've gone further further there's less and less limited children right is ... I'm going to remain it's predominately young man\nIt's very easy for gang members and people that are that do not have good intentions to get mixed up into this it and it makes it really easy for that matter it's really easy for terrorists to get into this group and that is alarming for US law enforcement here at Arizona\nI talk to but she got real yesterday she use our ... act for America dot org and great national security outlet it and she's just a really smart person she says if they've already found several people who aren't from ... south or or Central America they're certainly not from Mexico they're finding people who speak Spanish\nWho speak some other language that you might find a Middle East so there are I'm with you there shouldn't shenanigans going on this is somehow the balance of power after the capital hearings and now you've got all the co horrible Trump is on on the um on the border not really getting into that with you\nBut but the real boots on the ground and and that's who you're literally are you guys have to deal with the\nHelp of yeah are you if you get four thousand people all of a sudden and the next few days what do you do\nYou know we were very very well with ice and border patrol but this is a different situation than what we're used to dealing with because what's happening to these people just want to get in the country yeah typically what they do they run from they try to hide for border patrol and from us\nRight now they're actually running to border patrol and rush right because they know that once you're in the country\nThey can they're making these political asylum claim and then what do we do it all those people you know this is a ... this problem that should have everybody in this country\nTheir ears she'll be hurt and they should be wondering what are we going to do agree\nWe're going to continue to protect our community uh we uh we're concerned about the amount of people that are going to flow into this country and then there are communities and so we're watching this very closely\nBut you're from law enforcement guy ... and I say that maybe that's just a compliment but it's also your job I've got people up in Travis County Texas not far from where I Am a ... where the share of just doesn't care about them forcing the law I'm going to ignore those laws or force these laws\nYou seem to be a guy but says no here's the book this is what the laws are I'm going to follow those I'm going to enforce those going to make sure people abide by them\nWhat reaction do you get from people in our county residents there last question mark at every should be drawn out what reaction do you get from them when you say it's been when they get here we're going to make sure that we we you know\nStick to the laws are in are you a sense of nervousness among the community now with all these people had no way\nYou know we're very supportive community because we deal with it so much you know in this county everybody understands the majority of people understand the immigration issue where you'll with\nCars running for almost almost on there almost every night we deal with the drugs coming into our community or you've been affected by heroin it by a by standing on by these other drugs that they're trying to get our our ... public and are you hooked on so\nHere in Arizona and here in our county get for the most yup and uh so we get a lot of work and they they expect out of the I was voted into this position on those grounds that I was strong on border security and protecting our community so we have a lot of support from our up from the people that\nAre good they sound like very good people and they certainly have a great sure sure mark lamb when al ...

I Want somebody to bomb CNN I Would never want that I used to go to the fifth street or in a building I used to\nBe on headline news when Glenn Beck was off so I don't hate CNN I just know that they're not delivering the news ended up by a special go ahead\nOkay I think they have a four year degree in journalism and I think what President Trump for example or report it right\nNow he didn't do that you didn't do that now that you bought ... wanting sick or they you bought hook line and sinker you bought your bought a hook line and sinker Angela\nStop you can't be hurt if I'd speak it doesn't work that way than I did like I I don't have to let you answer because you make something up and your body to what the have you told you call back to call back of your for\nYour journalism degree next time I read twenty eight awards for excellence in journalism from the eighties from Michigan association of broadcasters that he gave the I Know the job CNN is purposely misleading people like you because it's affected it worked on you that's the problem\nSo look don't make this garbage up you want to believe CNN you want to walk with either going out because you agree with them don't pretend it's an unbiased outlet it's not I can give you a list of the big news stories that she and that itself has put out there John ... when we come back there right at [laughter]\n\nMessage to raise ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in this business\nFifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook I didn't write opinion pieces I gave you straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what by politics work\nSo bring it next time I get in as well but you better bring it better than that All right let me get to John Hi Bush he's the guy that runs the or the Reagan facility the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation about how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate ...\nI'm just great to be with\nYou I Am really glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll with wonderful but that's behind just got my attention or ... years it'd be a plane of some sort and some beautiful flags waving the breeze John what is that\nYeah well we're right here at the Reagan Library that are at fourteen at that Jen is one of the famous Jet Blue off the carrier that a President Reagan ordered to shoot down the Libyan fighter pilots are when they came after our fleet at one point to Nineteen eighty\nI Do remember that and I also remember that the President Reagan said watch this and went back in and launched an attack on on Gadhafi himself and that really got him under control didn't it\nSure did I mean that I came to the table now what are the ... Ronald Reagan was also that's all of us it so yeah ... ... here and it's a great little brought up to you know an alcoholic I bet it's a it's a great addition to the library\nWhile he was you know if you can move to your left or actually moved here right just for a second to actually see the plane I Want to show people that are in the oh that's beautiful looking at then handily nice All right I'm going to be the director and ask you to move back that was you know wasn't really excellent I Wonder if people watching to see that's that's cool All right I Want to talk about the Libyan crisis for a second the president then Ronald Reagan\nReally ... I I was very engaged in politics are more even though I was pretty young those Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old\nUm but but you really grabbed her attention because\nOf the way that he dealt with crises um she might have dealt with crisis the same way that Donald Trump would but he would do it in a very different way wouldn't it\nYeah you know I I've heard Trump often use the expression peace through strength\nYou know that was Reagan's blind and uh I find it fascinating to see a President Trump the day after day to take one page after another from the Reagan play ball address override the race in America that strong during the Reagan he says because of rape is on\nAnd I had written dramatically different styles that same thing conservative philosophy\nIt's very interesting it's John Hi but she's the executive director of the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation and Institute a really appreciate the time it's interesting to watch it because when President Reagan look there were people in the left who couldn't stand him either the media went after him all the time but the way that he handled it was very very different\nUm back then I remember the left in the right in this country all saying well oh hell yeah coffee's a bad guy that we have to go and get the bad guy if Trump says somebody's a bad guy the left knee jerk reaction is that he's racist these ... you still in the blink is\nWhat is it the way that Reagan dealt with with delivering the message is that why\nMe yeah in some respects I think it was a combination of the things Joe I'm you know in the Reagan years there was no such thing as where you know we didn't have the kind of social technologies that we have today so Reagan\nWhether they liked it or not I didn't I only way to get his message out was by I'll use the word loosely partnering\nWith uh the mainstream media right to go out to get us not to cross that was yeah I mean other than that you know a campaign advertising yet speaks rainy season CBS NBC right than CNN was a nice little channel at the time and so a Reagan had a script his moments and\nYou know working in in ... in unison with the general crafted try to get his message out he couldn't afford to make on the need the outside money that the whole ride a trauma you know he can tweak a you know he can reach out hunger willing Americans are more as a hundred and forty character right\nOn any given day and she says without the filter and I mean he doesn't need the media century\nLike Reagan did so in that respect us two very quite different styles and saying play themselves al\n... it's very interesting comparison to make and you're absolutely right um I I might be missed remembering this and I think that's a word Brian Williams said it was I I may be missed remembering this but Ronald Reagan appear to me to do more press conferences more news conferences where he would actually take the questions from the media\nTrump will do you know sort of announcements he'll walk out in on the fly he'll take some questions Obama almost never took the questions he be quite frankly even though the media was his buddy\nAh he he didn't want to sit there and be questioned by anybody why do you think Reagan did that is it because that was the only available way to get it out there and because of that is that why it appears as though he had a friendly relationship with a Sam Donaldson even even though the same Donaldson was always you know she's looking at him were sniping at all\nI I think your analysis is pretty good I I'm reading the script almost almost the cameras in Anaheim and we're not at all he had to work with me a message out\nPretty good I I'm Reagan had the script almost almost because the cameras pointed out we're not at all he had to work with media message out he couldn't speak directly to the American people right ah I you know I\nI find Trump that as a you know they they ... you can tell they study the Reagan certainly and other previous presidents they use the helicopter track you know [laughter] yeah you know he'll\nSometimes see and hear question he wants to hear and not here question he doesn't want to hear but right with all of the owner of a helicopter on his way out or\nI I I think it's true or Trump has not held nearly as many press conferences that Reagan right I ... as he's certainly gives his moments to the media on just about every given day is you know when he when they all know sworn into his office and you can only answer a few questions now and then so the ... the bottom line is is\nThe way the media African in ratings days if you wanted to get your message out you had to have right right and that's breaking would do in in this day and age you don't you know so Trump is creating its own rules and I don't blame him forty six using technology to his great man\nIt's John I Wish the executive director of Ronald Reagan presidential a foundation a news to do but it's interesting that you say that Trump is on television every day\nEvery single day and it's a new video shown by the new video clip every single day or you're taking long form you know rallies\nRick I don't remember Reagan doing any of these sort of rallies where he would show up at five ten Fifteen thousand people would be there she did do it from the White House rejected from and it was ... and he would do the media there there ... um is is that expeditiously different booted Reagan do a lot of his campaign like Trump is doing\nWell during the campaign years as Nineteen eighty floors where you just like his initial election campaign and boy did really well run a campaign of that no doubt about it but there again where I think Trump spin very inventor\nHe's actually said well okay what's the old rule he's never stopped campaigning for my mom when he announced to the President's Day and I don't think he's ever going to stop the way Donald Trump looks like it if you want to win reelection\nYou better campaign from the White House for from wherever you are every day a week\nAnd if you want to tell your own praises and you want to compliment you have to do it this way he has to be the cameras will be trained on them but he knows in a press conference it and I'm actually asking western you're I'm guessing he knows in a press conference he won't necessarily be able to tell his own praises is that what's happening\nI let's actually sell but I you know I think he's figured out not against the law that campaign you know so he's just inventing a whole new way to you know to put himself in front of the American people a lot I don't I yeah I ... I think\nWhether I'm sure there are styles in the future for different presidents won't be radically different\nThey're probably going to pick right up where it's proper left off because a lot of what he does actually works\nWell what's interesting is John ... she's the executive director the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation and Institute what's interesting to watch is thirty thirty five years later Ronald Reagan is praised by both sides\nAnd the media doesn't necessarily ever say anything negative about\nThis guy I don't think a hundred years from nobody's going to see anything good about them so it's almost like a raging if you don't walk slowly carrying a big stick and had a big smile where's Trump's just gets in your face is that in in your opinion is that the stark difference between the two because when you look at accomplishments like you said they're almost exactly the same\nYeah it's a it's a fascinating question you oppose because I I think about that every day I Trump is not such a bright white hot to do that the relationship so intense that I I I too cannot imagine twenty thirty forty years from now somehow\nThat dates media looking back you know we'll see deer my towards tourists Donald Trump and ... ... ... but also say very origin taste you never thought it would have been imaginable either a you know\nOr they may not have that as an as intensely war with each other not not at all but Reagan was the target of the liberal press every day he was an office there is no doubt about it and it's only really because of his remarkable successes but as you look back at him and his ... the facts are facts\nAre stubborn things and and people not look at the Reagan presidency and they have to give a nod yeah what side of the sense that you might be on\nGuard reviews John Hi Bush executive director the Ronald Reagan president foundation Institute I Wonder if you have an opinion on this and all of anybody's ask you this before but\nWhat was Ronald Reagan's um relationship with the media going in Donald Trump for forty years was a media darling in New York LA Washington everywhere\nThey loved him because he meant money they put him on people watch the show and they put him on people would advertise on the show this yeah this relationship went downhill in a matter of three years that's all we're talking about here three years ago right before he announced he was still let me do you darling", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "28"}
