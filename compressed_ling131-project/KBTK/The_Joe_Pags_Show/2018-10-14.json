during the campaign trail and he's going to take a name for a lot of Republicans that are in tight races and it's starting to look more and more like the Senate not only won't go to the Democrats but it looks like it's probably going to gain some Republicans\n\nCould be as many as three or four and then you'd have a majority of fifty four fifty five Republicans would be great to have sixty but you've got a super majority you didn't get really get some some things done the house however still up for grabs and it's interesting\nBecause um it was a an alleged blue wave not very long ago\nAnd then all of a sudden something funny happened on the way to the election things started changing people started saying I'm I'm not so sure ... and here's why and we could break it down very simply\nThe left in this country really shot itself in the foot when it comes to cabinet that's what happened they really did have momentum going\nThe reason why they have momentum was simple they were saying stuff like we used to have to be together we have to be diverted diversity is our strength and we were built on immigrants and we we're a country that's accepting that open arms and loving and it's a big tent and there's a big meaty with with uh you know orange hair or something in the White House\nAnd he does that mean guy who who grabs the women and the says the things and he's just a big meaning stupid face who who doesn't have the the temperament to be the president and the twenty Fifth Amendment impeachment is the right way to go in and there were saying these things that people were buying into\nWell yeah I Want\nPeace and harmony own understanding diversity I Won a a big tent where everybody's welcome and we love immigrants and so on\nThat was working and then came Kavanaugh ... row and the left showed who were really was you had Spartacus grow because Booker\nYou had Dianne Feinstein sitting on a letter that she had that somebody alleged sexual impropriety\nYeah tunes just is outraged at all times is it's not going his way you've got Richard Blumenthal who's a liar about his service claiming that he went to Vietnam when he never did\nYou've got Kamala Harris who things are going to run for president when I don't know that I've ever seen somebody more negative and nasty toward her political foes you got any global Charlotte who who thinks they're drinking beer at six am used cool you had acted like it was bad that Brett Kavanaugh had a beer back in college so\nYou have the left that was interrupting that was rude that was outlandish that was out of line\nThat\nActually used as a pawn lousy forward or when she she asked to be anonymous and not be out there in the public lied to her or her legal team did who by the way it was suggested by Feinstein lied to her about whether they would come out interviewer in California\nI mean the entire thing really show to the left is so they can save togetherness and we want to work across the aisle like we've got this idiot Robert Francis O'Rourke running for Senate in Texas goes by that uh for some reason he calls himself ...\nHe's not Hispanic but all of his bumper stickers just said BDO and all of a size just say ...\nYou want to believe that his name is Beto O'Rourke is Robert Francis or work what it is fourth generation Irish American nothing wrong with that just don't pretend you're somebody you're not\nHe's a guy that was in a punk rock band and word dress he was arrested for for ... W why in the late nineties the guy who reported him because there was an accident says he tried to flee the scene the police report says he tried to flee the scene\nPolitically he said things like I'm open to the idea of abolishing eyes he said things like we basically stole half of Mexico from them\nWhich is patently untrue\nHe said things like he would definitely want to impeach the president of the United states should he get in he's an open borders guy he believes in open borders doesn't want a border wall yet when you see these commercials or here's commercials he's saying things like or diversity is our strengths and we need to be together and work together for a better Texas\nWas that crap doesn't work anymore because people with America actually watch what you people did\nIn the capital hearings it was disgusting and you went from probably winning the Senate till you're going to lose it now provided people actually go out and vote you need to go and vote and and a guaranteed when in the house doesn't look so likely anymore\nAnd the reason for that is people understand that right now under this president they've got lower taxes we've got more jobs and we've had ever\nWe've got black and Hispanic unemployment through the roof women unemployment through the roof you've got manufacturing coming back our standing in the world is much better the terrorists are working because we're getting better deals with Mexico and with Canada and with the ... you [noise]\nThings are shifting\nThe left overplayed its hands\nAnd that's what we're seeing now she doesn't have to pretend like the president doesn't doesn't like us granted loves Robert ... which is just dumb when we come back we're going to hear from Sarah pale and former governor of Alaska right here\nOn the weekend don't touch that ah\nYeah it's the weekend with young\n[noise]\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it sinks or not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet\nThat's exactly right and Joe I was impressed because nobody else was talking about that but share um what her action was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the night circuit out of\nSan Francisco right you know it talked about injustice and justice being delayed for Alaska because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nUm the second largest as the eleventh than they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very person very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more\nAnymore say over Alaska so for at least be messing around with that uh that was very very dangerous another thing is that the Trump President Trump saw the lights and is allowing al ... only decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has\nIn terms of resources to help our country become more\nEnergy independent that inherently between energy and security energy prosperity that's Anwar that's our oil and gas development here in Texas and elsewhere\nThat Lisa would put that in jeopardy and gave that to her he gave that to her to Alaskans but it was through her and for I mean that was a\nReal nice thank you Trump or ... ...\n... it just it just doesn't make any sense of ... of course you know sort of heroin I'm a I got to jump on that we are reliant on people in the middle East that don't necessarily like us\nWanting are going to and from what some of the geology subset of two hundred years were the world there and then why wouldn't we go and get to become self reliance\nAnd during the streak at all to these bad guys and by the\nWay we were ... voted no I Want everybody watching and listening especially those of you in the last year she voted no one cabinet officially isn't it a president vote because later she changed it for dangerous going back to his daughter's wedding so she said I'm just going to vote president disorder counterbalance what his bill would have been\nBut she on the record in the first round should know\nLiteral I'm absolutely so that's that's typical political move that's a typical politician wanting to kind of play both sides if she truly had a problem with Kavanaugh being on the bench and she said he's not the right man for the bench then she her both than at the final vote what reflected that instead of say oh well I\nWant to do this because it's not really count anyway have you really believe something if you have that talk with pointing due north knowing what the right thing is to do then you fight for that but instead it's very wishy washy and should learn you know ...\nIn the middle of the road get hit on both sides\nJeffrey Rosen is or a villain the former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party to vote was also the governor's race state of Alaska in just a great person and I love the we're having this conversation or you're going to take a wrong because your tweet might have been the best we never seen\nThis entire year ah it was a loser ... twenty twenty two from our house\nRight is that going to happen\nYou know the only thing that keeping me from just being close to the wall enthusiastic about the idea is it twenty twenty two so far away\nThough that that I mean that's almost frustrating looking that far but for some like me was always preaching to people stand up maybe a different take the gifts and challenges and opportunities God created for you and\nThe different well you know I Can't just keep preaching it and not jumping and also at some point one of these positions I Would so desire serving of this country and we'll see where that goes before I forget yeah sure when we're talking about the second amendment I'm ... which\nJudge Kavanaugh is he's he's absolutely pro constitution right here at\nLeast the hesitating Leigh voted for President Obama's tax on different judicial positions including getting there on the DC circuit she pro abortion totally anti gun anti commonsense constitutional is is she and leaving no problem at all\nSo she can to to um exercise to vote 'em up and down it was always up for Obama's picks but wouldn't give that same ... back and think consideration for a good man like Kavanaugh says another problem that leads to has and the Trump has\nIs that we had many never Trump first around her rather than have proper\nAnd um she hired a lot of never Trump first then has hired a lot of never Trump ... and some of these folks you know we keep warning him about you can't win them over there going to continue to undermine and that's quite unfortunate for the ... movement\nBut why did we were calcium an aura under her name is just to get the votes in Alaska hoping that people won't pay attention to the record what you just I just now in the past minute we're told me I can never vote for\nYeah a ... and that is why yeah that are by the name I mean that's that's it's a consummate right oh yeah\nRight it's your opinion of the vice presidential nominee and also the phone number to reach me to ask a certain the moment I have left I I wouldn't be remiss if I didn't go back to how you and your family were treated by the media when you know she can and I imagine I Know some days in my life\nThat really great I was told my family I just want you to doing something I could imagine when you're told John McCain want you to be the vice presidential nominee almost like Brett Kavanaugh being told\nDonald Trump want you to be it was a record it's gotta be jubilation it's gotta be unbelievable Julian and high fives and Billy bumps in a bunch left and then all of a sudden the media says we're going to get her mission\nDozens and dozens you'd be able to find anything they possibly can\nIn a bunch left and then all of a sudden the media says we're going to get her mission and dozens and dozens of people to find anything they possibly can on using committed with capital can you relate to what are you must have gone through in the past month I'm guessing you done\nA little in your right up you know the Obama administration and the media they sent that doesn't that doesn't that was right here where\nI'm standing right now in my yard woman early in the yard to anything but um yeah I could relate the thing that I disagree with judge Kavanaugh on it a proclamation that it has to have a seizure or destroyed the family\nNo it doesn't destroy your family your circle the wagons it it actually um you can't use it you can get out there all that that um the marking that lie about you\nAnd really use it at empathy for other people who go through a bunch of crap in this world because everybody does\nI use that power you to get out there and do the right thing and it's like really really hard for the underdog like really hard for those who don't have that platform that microphone just speak up project\nIt's Europe pay less cost you to pick your shorts for doing this but I just have to do as you see the left become even more on ... when you hit the national spotlight was ten years ago now I'm ... and it was a huge don't read it\nBut now it's ridiculous you people literally scratching up the Supreme Court door as if they're digital stopping for being sworn in they'd gone completely nutty\nHow do you counter balance that and how do we get the voices 'cause I think the majority of Americans aren't like that how do we get the voices of the normal people among us to to rise to the top again or is that is that a really hard because the media\nIs showing joined ratings are getting from showing these idiots\nWell yeah I mean there's a triple threat against that the media\nThe opposing party and then right within our own party right Lenny happen like that so I you know Reagan's wife but no we are made now ... I think our me for a change in this that and um the corruption in that lack of accountability\nIn twenty six year when\nWe come back the man as a person but that Trump movement were the people stood up and said enough is enough rat quote go will make a difference but it's funny a couple of my girlfriends that I work in the last couple of days during the the Kavanaugh discussion on\nOur little group of friends out there that we\nWould like these radical [laughter]\nYou know we haven't gone I\nThink that's a fact that you know the more they become unhinged I I think the more that I'm reasonable rational Americans which is the majority we said enough is enough of that and we're going to get in there we're going to put government back on our side get it off our back we're going to follow the constitution constitution is all about\nLimiting government we can govern ourselves and I know I think people like you who have the guts to be out there every day in the arena make it a different where you guys so keeping\nOkay we're going to do that as Sarah ... million along with millions of other Americans I voted for you to Belgian ... both for your heartbeat again I really appreciate you reached dumps picture taken the time today\nThank you so much for your\nMemory sheets are available to take a bit of time you know it was interesting how we ended up connecting she riding around in Alaska\nAnd listens to my program everyday Ronnie ... an acreage industry which words you use it also want to know it's very much\nBut every object to talk to her and she really doesn't have a similar if not even worth story the terminal does because come away with it for three weeks or a general days we're sure if you had to put up with it for more than a year in her family to the microscope at just the\nThe craziest from the left him in the warrior showing up in Alaska\nHer perspective really made a lot of sense to me and I look I Want you to reach ...\nLisa Murkowski in my opinion do not represent the people of Alaska once you voted no on Brett Kavanaugh memories that you gave was because he's not the right guy at the right time which doesn't mean you're also you just heard one eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty Joe ... dot coms the writer\n\n\nOh\nOh\n\nSeven point one of the big Tucker is Katie TK Katrina village Flagstaff Prescott Ninety seven point one the big talk to her more stimulating Todd\n[noise]\nA rally covering a lot of ground I'm Jerry Thomas Fox News during a campaign rally in Kentucky Saturday Night President Trump offered condolences the victims of hurricane Michael and also thanks first responders for their work\nPeople FEMA the first response [noise]\nAnd all of\nNational Guard\nPersonnel\nThere now on the ground\nAt least Eighteen people die from hurricane Michael the president was campaigning for re election of ... congressman Andy Barr who's being challenged by Democrat Amy McGrath you also unveiled a new slogan for a run in twenty twenty keep America great\nThe president also says he doesn't plan to hold in an arms deal with Saudi Arabia but he did tell a pool of reporters before he left for Kentucky that the disappearance of Saudi Washington Post reporter Jamal ... is on his mind\nWhen I have to find out what they did write that turkey is very deep into it were in constant communication and frankly other countries are looking at it do it for the guys that we'll get to the bottom of\nThe president's speaking after his meeting with pastor Andrew Brunson who is back in the U.S after being detained in Turkey for two years boxes Gary ... says Brunson released was a major priority for the president\nWhen in agreement fell through a few months ago in fact the Trump Administration slapped sanctions on two top officials in the Turkish government and then double tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum both of which were major blows to Turkey's already struggling economy\nPresident Trump think Turkish president Recep everyone and stress the U.S didn't make any deal or concessions in order to get ... and really\nA Turkish court convicted brunt of aiding terrorists Dodger ... at the end of the U.S with the brewers Astros the red Sox in game\nOne of the A.

I guess he seems to have said he's got a million dollars so he's a very wealthy guy very successful guy a set of people being happy and all sides that he showed up at the White House some potential you've got something to where he's working with the president to\nTo reform prisons to get more jobs in the inner in the inner city and fewer prison cells and maybe more dads in homes he seemed to be very positive\nAbout what he wanted to get done\nFor the United states of America you know he was a test the attack mercilessly I guess there were some pedaling see and I'm sure you've seen in years but I guess there was some mental on there and they were all black people who were calling him a token negro\nThat somehow appropriate in the minds of the left to this country in this day and age what kinds of us went to the White House who did and said\nMost of it was pretty easy to comprehend again you wanted your jail cells more jobs you want to more parents to stay in and support their children or you want to do see more things made you know the United states of America in fewer things made abroad those are all good things they should be\nUniversal for anybody on the left or the right but for some reason he took a whole lot of hell because see deer go and spend time with this president's specifically\nThe left many of them don't know why they're ... they're indoctrinated their told the fake\nBut for some reason those who are the leaders on the Web\nCoupon pushing this false narrative\nThat somehow ... bad and anybody who's anywhere near him is also bad\nIt's actually it's to me demeaning to not only the office of the presidency but it's also demeaning to anybody who's got a brain who actually says I like more jobs I like capitalism elect freedom and liberty I don't like socialism let me go to a mall in Anchorage, Alaska all what's going on\n[noise] Joe a while I was watching the video Kanye West visiting the White House with President Trump is ... and older black man sitting there are other fat was a a follower than running back Jim Brown\nYeah hundred percent was Jim round yes\nOkay I just never heard anybody mention anything about it and now I'm not surprised some what I heard a gym ground as a you\nKnow oil to the ... and just that good common sense now than\nHe is he's also loyal to the flag he thinks that the current day NFL players should stand during the national anthem with their hands over their heart to show the proper respected reverence if you want to protest go protest and you're off hours but he was there Jim Brown didn't say a whole lot because Congress said a ton\nAnd um it was funny because the president actually set up for Conyers rent you said a gym do you want to say that there's ... no ... I'm good I'm ... and nobody could blame him because of what can you just do it but yeah what's your brown\nJim Brown is a guy who's been an activist as a wife is like eighty something like that and um and he's one of the loudest voices telling NFL players in in this day and age or make it on average two billion dollars a year stop it\nStop it support the president's support the country support the ... the idea that America is a great land the best on planet earth let me go back to its they had a gym in Idaho Jim what's happening Hi\nAm I don't\nKnow I guess so if your gym in Idaho yeah oh yeah I Want to talk about drugs does but I I said thank God we the people we the people yeah good for him I re\n... saw the ... pay these protesters to go around you all this stuff and we know that ... anyway I just wonder if you knew any more but I Am I have one specific question I heard that I don't know it's true or does he feel the electronic voting machine\nBut no I Would say no no the George Soros is not somebody who's a billionaire because he builds things he's a billionaire because of of the stock market I Believe uh but no ... doesn't build the voting machines no\nOkay I I heard that I was like wow if if if that was\nWell that would be ridiculous wouldn't have got good that'd be not yet no\nThat would be that would be that anyway um yeah and why does not government there's something about him I mean they already know I mean if it's all over the\nAge of ... what do we do it's his money you could pay people\n\nI have and we just have if you want to expose again but what what we need to do is let people know what you know what I Know that he's a bad guy he's a socialist he was the Nazi sympathizer when he was a kid a ... and the guys you just there's no good guy so what can we stop him from spending money no I don't want them to stop him from spending this money that would be like telling us that we have to stop spending our money\nIs he a U.S citizen\nOr I don't know that I don't know\nAnd it's a good question um but again he's he's financing activist group sees financing political action committees or or um political action conditions\nSo is he really is he really donating directly\nNo but yes it's pretty just to give it\nTheir way to arms with geo palm [noise]\n\n\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it shapes are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet\nWouldn't it be great if there was a seats that had to look up a beautiful empty so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino iron works shakes at rhino safe dot com\nProfound two things first one is\nThat service so that's just simply what comes in in income or into a household and then what goes out for obligations like student loans car payments mortgages\nCredit card debt okay read on the lowest level the percentage of income and go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies and household net worth in this country such assets minus liabilities it's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion although I'm Hi\nYeah so if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\nWell it's not affecting my spending but it's a great question and it's interesting that you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better sales we've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat\nThan they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash 'em but you know what the media does the media has to find if it if it bleeds it leads and the stock market's bleeding right now that's where the lady with it\nBut when people generally watch it when you when you talk to your investors the people that that you work with or do they call you immediately say oh my God what are we do or or do they say well it's kinda crazy going to go out to eat now\nYeah so [laughter] you know what I mean nobody causes nobody calls me with their dinner plans [laughter]\nI'm gonna I'm gonna from now on but the British it I call 'em\nSo I Do get some people are concerned of course in that apprehension that's obvious and makes sense logical\nAlso get folks on the other side that are looking to do some buying but let me give you a little perspective so the market bottomed in March of oh nine so I was following the meltdown of oh eight and nine\nWe have had this ... this will be at the twenty third but we've had twenty three now correction sense over nine five percent or more and they average I sent this out the clients this morning just to give some perspective [noise]\nTwenty three times since nine that what we're going through right now is happening average decline is nine point three percent\nWere down about six or seven now um but even today Joe I'm now seen on my screen as I'm watching a in real time we're starting to see some of the stocks the leaders are which were technology and these are the names we all know Amazon Microsoft Apple Facebook ... companies\nUm we're down early today than down hard this month\nBut now starting to sure I mean Facebook as an example uh this is not a recommendation on Facebook but the shock was in August\nThat over two hundred and ten dollars a share today it's traded and the one fifties now it was read earlier down on the day but now it's green Microsoft same thing it was lower early today now that's turned up so it looks like\nWe're starting to see a little bit of selective buying the average stock or this needle is moving but the average stock since this sell off happen is down about Fifteen Percent\nWell pretty big correction yeah now here's the thing to you mentioned this it kind of in passing\nIs too expensive is it over done the market is trading at about the price earnings ratio which that's just simply the price divided by earnings it's about sixteen probably right that a sixteen point to sixteen twenty three twenty five year average sixteen point one\nSuch right words we just rent\nThem years yeah you're not cheap so it's not like oh nine when everything was on sale but you're certainly not at twenty three twenty four times what you're saying cheese\nOr forty percent overvalued no we're smack at\nTwenty five year average rate now\nIt is I Do gather managing director and senior vice president Raymond James and associates a always incredible knowledge let me ask you something off the beaten path and you know for Twenty one years no do you tell me the most smartest you so you're about to prove it here um\nLittle gas partly what do I do write a gas prices go down we're happy\nGas prices go down because the price per barrel goes down so we're happy with the gospel with a price for mental goes down with the stock market generally speaking goes down and we're all supposed to freak out be angry that that the stock market is going down so\nAgain maybe maybe it's just completely outlandish but should we get to the point to where we don't have these valuable resources like gasoline like liquefied natural gas like\n... you know I'm I'm utility that we all need\nMaybe we don't have those on the stock market and the reason why I say that is we're happy when the prices go down with the prices go down in the stock market goes down is I Would guess and it could be wrong but it's rare to see the price per barrel of gas go down and the stock market go up\nSo how do you feel is somebody who does this for a living and you've done it for as long as I've known you when you do it very well\nHow do you feel about those being connected is it right just to have gasoline per barrel um stock market or or not because again it seems to be the opposite of what I Want I Want lower gas prices but I Want my stocks to be well\nYeah it's a good that's an interesting question so you you really can't a separate those for a couple of different reasons a number one is you have companies like Chevron\nAnd acts on as an example yeah I'm right there publicly traded so they're going to be on the exchange just like home depot and apple are going to be on the exchange that\nThe commodity itself um oil in this case or natural gas as you were mentioning\nThose are the importance of course into a lot of different products right and so you have to have a market price I mean if you look at commodities you can buy cattle hogs oil natural gas platinum played in whatever it's all out there with a\nI wanted I wanted to I Want to interject there's no cars I see where you're going to make sense but why did you run about but let's talk about apple I've got an iPhone or I Want to go by the new iPhone right\nAnd Apple's stock dumped today's Fifteen Percent they're not going to drop the price of the iPhone tomorrow because their stock price went down but at the price per barrel of oil goes down in the stock prices go down to those little companies I Am going to pay pay less for it at the gas well that it's like\nIs it okay that's what we actually paid us consumer seems to be directly tied to the price per barrel which is for some reason in flux because of what's happening we stock market\nMaybe I vote is going to change price because apple gained or lost money today that voters the eyeball that's what it costs that's what the planet\nRight [noise] yeah okay so the ah let's see let's see um battery\nLittle smarter than you thought I was actually makes no sense whatsoever and I'm trying to [laughter] live on a record Idaho your Rebecca ...\nYeah yeah yeah so it's just us dissect the iPhone for an example we all know they have lithium batteries yeah so let's see him as a commodity right um so that's going to train up and down just like crude oil\nThat's part of the cost structure for Apple now they might do things to hedge that input cost if they take lithium prices are going to run away to the upside\nBecause they don't want the iPhone going for um a thousand to twelve hundred just because the battery went up by two hundred right um so\nIt's kinda it's a hard question to answer I think the short answer is no uh oil is part and parcel to the equation a book just as the raw commodity\nAnd then all of the ... of that which are directly ... energy companies but then more broadly Joe plastic on an iPhone right ah well guess what that comes from where oil right show it's just it's it's just there\nWas a big apple is in effect that I think the right answer is from the dumb guy perspective here the right answer is apple already mark set up by a hundred percent so early making Ninety five percent markup I think they're still gonna be okay and that really is true it cost them exactly half\nOf what of what they're charging for an iPhone so I guess where you've got that kind of wiggle room you could you could survive in the next time we speak do me a favor let's talk about why the price per barrel of oil is it lower for us specifically when we're exporting no more than we've ever\nExported and we're actually exporting no more than we're importing had a great question from a call yesterday he said we're we've got all this oil why we keep on exporting it will just keep it we find ourselves and I know that it's a it's a global market that's why but maybe you could break down exactly how that works next not going to do that\nYeah you bet that Judy appreciate Doug I learn to use ... of the managing director\nAnd also the senior vice president of investments overreaching good associates I we started dug and half or more than Twenty years now when it comes to stuff like we saw happening with the stock market this past week a great information is always one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe ... dot coms that writer\n\nMessage to raise ...\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in
