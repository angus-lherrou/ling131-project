Peterson live from Los Angeles California turned my cabin on more and now African Americans finally or why there's been some polling that seemed to indicate\nAnd I have to say they're gay or in danger jot a zones and this woman would not do anything about it and she doesn't want anyone else to do it at the age to solve a problem\nAs a matter of fact she said ... be quiet him because he doesn't understand how he's influence and black people he doesn't she doesn't want them to think for themselves and she was the ghettos\nShe made a promise to black people that the Republicans were trying to tear down and projects\nIn the ghetto right but she said I'm not going to let the Republicans do that and not all that might not going to let them turn out to project I'm going to be more for you\nAnd making that kind of promising to black voters in her district while she's living in a four point three million dollar homes suburbs she does it have to be concerned about the climate of violence that's happening in those areas\nHow is it possible that the worst place for an African American to live in America isn't a black congressional district no matter where it is you take this twenty five or thirty blocks rational districts and it's the worst place for black folks to live anywhere in the country but\nThere are so good at a voting responsibility\nFor the implementation and the results of their policies are so good at blaming everyone but themselves\n... will black folk ever look at themselves and say look at our status what do you have to lose whatever Logan themselves in Los Angeles Chicago Cincinnati New York and saying\nWait a minute we have lousy education system we have no job creation we're rampant crime rampant abortion rampant welfare and the Democratic party's been here for fifty or sixty years\nAnd it's amazing to me you're going to have this little result\nBlaming everyone else to take no responsibility like Maxine Waters\nAnd that could probably ... days and not going to get better for them until they do take a look at themselves and their responsibility for their own lives and until they realize that the Democrats have been lied to them for Seventy years or so\nAnd uh they never intended and it never were doing the same for them they don't want them better they want their brain washed jumped out and do more lives because that's how you control them\nYou can't control a more personal and more people you have to eat raw life then you have to keep them angry and whatever the Democrats want more power whenever they want to get in\nA a vote they cry racism because they know they could crowd is phony ideal racism that most of us will go into a hypnotic trance and walk right into the voting booth and vote for the Democrats that's why they keep using that\nAnd it's not going to change it till the glass take responsibility and until white people stop being afraid of the phony words blacks are suffering not because those a lot of racism but due to lack of moral character the destruction of the family and living on as supportive of the Democratic plantation bill\nWell you know in Chicago la corn McDonnell was a young man\nWho was threatening large numbers of people with a knife they didn't know what is the time he was with PCP which is a crazy drunk and then he was shot by cop who made a mistake the cops and not a shot him the way he was shot he was kind of walking away from the ... made a split second life and death decision that was wrong cops are taught\nThat if somebody has a nice within Twenty one feet of your being it takes less than a second for them to take the ... so now it looks like one life in Chicago can be misused\nTo advance their political agenda which has had cops at the same time seven hundred\nAmericans living in Chicago will be dead this year four thousand are going to get shot\nAnd including that boy put in a barrel and put on fire there is no marches no protests milk scream and holler none about a little boy and a barrel who wouldn't joined a gang ... that's like moved on but if you can find years ago and she called ... made a mistake\nThat the company fundraising tool\nAs a matter of fact when there's a black or white or black cop or white or black situation they celebrate that they love it when that happened because it opened up as you just said is open up opportunities for fundraising\nThey can accuse why people they can uh live and just see that but I think and Kevin White people and it's all for the purpose of more power well for themselves\nThey don't care about black people they don't care about white people they don't care about illegal aliens they don't care about the children they care about gaining power and wealth and so that's why they jump on those chocolate situation and pushed it alive that the cops are caused by letter to the police brutality\nAnd they support of of like having a a cap or they can put the dinosaur Neal and then turning their backs on the fly around the country\nAre at the football games because they want this far out there that is to why Republicans but it's about power and wealth for the Democratic party and no one else\nWell Jesse you and I have a lot more yesterdays in tomorrow's yes and\nUh I like to think each of us from Cincinnati and from Los Angeles has some minimal impact\nIn the lives of those who might want to listen and change in in Los Angeles is now overrun with illegal aliens which hurts black folks can you tell us in Los Angeles I see a little bit in Cincinnati but in Los Angeles Chicago Memphis New York what is the status of African Americans in relationship to illegal aliens from Mexico\nDevastating if the world really knew\nHow destructive is over there are in South central LA sell like cops in watts\nThere it will be here as they would demand that the big the police officer the government do something illegal alien gang members have come in handy of come in first number one that was taken away day labor day job some blacks who can't get rid of a job because they're not educated don't know how to go out there\nThe violence and drugs and crime that has crossed the borders into south central LA is beyond a word is devastate a lot of black leave a sausage or our lady of moving back to the south\nThey move into a Oregon and Arizona and places like that they're looking for a safe haven because Massey Warner's Senate black leadership over there would not do anything about it\nIn the media and others are given a foster impression\nThat black or Hispanic or getting all alone they are not being eight one oh they hate the fact that these people are coming in and taking over their schools neighborhoods and jobs it's so bad that at one point but the trip to the ... has joined forces to fight against illegal gang members\nBecause they are supported by drug laws from Mexico\nAnd the other thing in Los Angeles school system is a hundred of Nineteen different languages and dialects yes one cannot function in an environment where every student who is speaking a different language or dialect\nIs entitled to under federal law that a person that they're said to translate everything happening in class one can imagine the chaos when you're in a classroom at thirty to forty students speaking maybe twenty or thirty different languages and it was no one is understood in behavior and norms are not followed\nAnd mom and dad don't exist in the home front to back up the teacher yeah that's the one that's the reason black folks are being decimated Los Angeles\nAnd and I I work with a lot of black kids from those areas and a lot of them and just dropping out of school because they say that the teachers are put into focus on the one that kept me events and put it in a focus more focused on an illegal alien then they are the citizens\nAnd so and the parents are not paying attention because most of the kids are coming from single payer hold a black women who were born in America those who were born in this country\nSeventy seven percent of their children are bored out of wedlock so they don't have parents who are paying attention and to kiss a feeling I Lived at home and asked who they're just drop it out at ... the day goes by where there's not a fight between illegal aliens\nAnd the and the black kids there so it's a real it's devastating to build I Can't find or just when\nYou're an educated men maybe a lot of self taught like I Am but I cannot imagine being a black kid in Los Angeles or Chicago or Memphis or Denver Cincinnati or New York you're sixteen years old\nYou have no functional family you know you're a functionally illiterate you can't go to high school because you're kicked out or don't learn a damn thing nothing's been done\nYou have no job future you have no capability of forming a permanent relationship with a woman and getting married having a family and having your own property that as devastating and that is the light\nAnd that is the life and a lot of literally tens of millions of black and brown and poor white kids in America today and I don't see do you see anything changing\nA short of a miracle from God I don't see it\nYou know my non profit organization bond the Brotherhood organization over new destiny for the last Twenty years now we have been rebuilding their family by rebuilding the mass oh we've been able to help some of those boys from those areas but it's overwhelming at this point and especially if the government the ACLU and\nThey in a CPA and others are covered it up because they just power well it just seemed like a hopeless situation right now\nAnd in fact in most almost all of the urban areas in this country Donald Trump Republican Paul Ryan Mitch McConnell got nothing to do with running the large cities in this country they're all Democrats so something's wrong educationally crime why something wrong with the welfare state something wrong with black and job creation", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "08"}
