Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin Iowa Florida Texas\nHurt Obama's say vote for Hillary we've got four more years of my policies that's what caused working class folks in these so called swing states to

I Want to be with the president\nAnd he's a warm caring engaging person the way the way it works the rope line\nAre private time together our discussion\n... was fabulous and a and I'm going to share that interview with you here coming up in about five or six minutes\nAnd I think you're going to find it very good because you get you're going to get a sense of the man and what he what lies ahead what the interview today I think are tonight on sixty minutes I thought was ridiculous Leslie stall that a horrible lousy job I think my time with the president a couple of nights ago was much better\nSo I'm going to hear that interview or in a few minutes\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states so it was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states so the European Union they formed and they are they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they show Mercedes\nBenz and BMWs by the millions they come in during the Indians and we charge him essentially no tax just two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay if we want to send the piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I tell them I'm going to start\nTaxing because because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said as soon as I recall me back but\nI'm going to give you one more chance and in ... that's okay I'm going to actually cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money and they immediately helped in a plane and came over and talk to and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with them I can tell you they want to sure but\nWe're going to make it one way or the we'd be able to find a way of five hundred million a year five trillion over ten we felt Shanghai we felt Beijing at some point we've got to start building America they got the new airport we don't have the new airport they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point our money's got to come back to America\nYou're so right so China's been taken out of five hundred billion dollars you people have no idea what that is five hundred billion we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President she said we can't do it very simple we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've now put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been no effect you know what people do say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because it said twenty five percent\nSo we're taking and billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become expensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make the products here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we used to do it so China has been like China is\nThe biggest civil mall by far it's probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost over the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade we lose with everybody those days are over\nBill how Leslie wherever the midterms coming up one of my favorite movies is Jimmy Stewart is a wonderful life I look at Bedford Falls\nBelow sea takes the house Schumer Texas Senate your life becomes miserable the last two years what do you say the middle class Americans all over the country that say you know what\nWe don't want Bedford Falls away it look we want the New Bedford falls what do you say to those who say the mid term relax take it easy not important Renee see whether it's black burner Heller we don't have to worry about that what do you say to motivate the base\nWell I Hope we're nation is going to do well first of all he's a great guy but I I just say just country watch just forget a country where\nYou have to go out and vote my phone numbers are so good but a lot of people say I'm not running so we're not going to be one percent Rasmussen fit we want now we're doing great and and then they say you can add a lot to it because when people hang up and they say we don't want to talk to you that means it's a Trump phone record of that's good or bad but that's what I mean it's a we have to\nDo well I Will say I think we're going to do very well on the Senate and a lot of things have happened since justice now justice Kevin are Fifteen an hour and Fifteen to judge many many judges\nAnd we're going to have a hundred and forty five judges fairly soon when you think about it I mean a hundred and forty five it will be close to fifty percent of the whole judiciary not only to Supreme Court justices so\nBut that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with justice Kevin are because\nI've rarely seen a person treated so badly the man of great distinction a great life and the way they treated him was horrible and since that happened Republicans are looking so is everybody they see what's going\nOn not the law of unintended consequences because I've had many women were spurred my air ville I with Kevin they don't want to say publicly but if you send in a in a weird sense Kevin all as motivated the Republican face when otherwise it wouldn't have happened\nAnd you've been a great friend of mine and I appreciate it you've been a very terrific guy it's also a terrific talent you know a lot of people can't do what you do you know this is talk relatives Russian about that not too many and Sean is you know showing us great but these are great people great talents\nAnd I appreciate it do we have to do well uh I think we're going to do well in the Senate I think we can pick up some seats in the Senate and the polls\nIf you look three weeks ago and you look now it's like especially with the ... well she was she was nine points down now she's four or five points up Marcia from Tennessee
