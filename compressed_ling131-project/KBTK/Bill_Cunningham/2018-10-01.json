story so kind of give me your take on what's going to happen later this week when the FBI gets done and what are we doing Brett Kavanaugh I think it will be a great Supreme Court just\nYeah I mean I listen I I assume I Hope and I think you'll be a Supreme Court justice but I don't know because\nThe whole point of this was Jeff Flake in my opinion this was set up shop for like ... is he and I think Senator McCain to women aren't allowed to get an elevator with the United States Senate\nAnd the Capitol building how did they get in this whole thing was a set up Jeff Flake they asked them to come in that was his cover for demanding an FBI investigation [noise] you know how those two women getting the elevator that convinced him\nTo change his mind from a yes vote to I Want an FBI investigation and the answer is that it was set up from day one\nAnd he wanted those two women in the elevator and he wanted to use them as cover so there has to be a reason they want this one week delay and of course it is either because they're going to have ten more women come forward and write and claimed that brick capital raped them or attempted rape them or whatever it to them\nIf this was real how can any once it gets real when they interviewed him one on one face to face and never mentioned that there's a woman claiming you attempt to rape or they\nSaved it for the last days to see\nFirst if they might be able to beat him some other way and then this is going to be their last chance Hail Mary to try to destroy and let's just go ahead and ...\nAnd and they're using the same deal they used against Clarence Thomas stormed the exact same playbook it's the same playbook they used against judge Roy Moore I mean I don't know anything about Roy Moore bill I really don't and I thought his answers were kind of strange and invasive and I wasn't quite sure whether I should support him\nBut in the end I came down on the idea that this\nWas forty years ago and a bunch of women were making up stories none of which could be prove none of which had evidence and none of which had witnesses you cannot allow a man to be defeated based on that and they decided to work with judge Roy Moore let's use it with with Brett Kavanaugh it's very clear that that's what this is if it was real fights they would have brought\nIt up in one on one meetings with the man can you imagine if I'm up for a major job and someone gets a letter that says oh Wayne rooted tempted to rape me and you sit across to me and you\nSay nothing but then two months later you bring it up well that means the whole thing was a farce in the beginning\nSo look here's what my column basically said I Am Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh as me Brett Kavanaugh as you and if they could do it to him they could do it to anyone I grew up in an all Catholic neighborhood mostly Italian part Irish\nI was number one in my class like Brett Kavanaugh I was a sports star like Brett Kavanaugh I went to Columbia He went to an Ivy League school Yale we both got out of the chief great success\nIn life and now they're trying to destroy him and I can tell you one thing guys like that do raped women there's no way it does happen\nFind me a case in America where a guy who's number one in his class and it was ideally educator with the sports started a great kid has tons of women friends and tons of childhood friends who stand up for him and become the well regarded judge and suddenly\nYou find out he was a rapist or attempted rape is direct gang rape is it's the stupidest area of ever heard I grew up with nothing but Catholic school boys\nAnd let me tell you we all like women but we're all nice guys were like the date when we don't like to raped women and I've never heard anything so outrageous and so stupid and my entire life show me a witness okay no problem there are none nobody saw it happen it didn't happen\nIn the name she provided ... did not telling the truth is burned terminals man he's a he's a

the fact that there's no way I Would bring charges against him in a real courtroom will be a lawyer would say after everything we know\nWhich is there's no way there's no evidence for thirty six years ago I was single oh you're a prosecutor in the world that would actually say what bring charges and I'll Fight you somebody ought to be in jail with that person to jail\nBecause God Forbid they come and get my son or my daughter you know horrible people the people and say something like that they don't even know what they're doing they don't even understand the law for God's sakes\nAnybody can charge anything anybody without a shred of evidence you cannot move forward with the word of one person got that same hospital for thirty six years ago and and so she didn't even ... even with that either a ... person if the mind whenever you Brett Kavanaugh\nWho went by the way from I hear what you're saying yeah it was\nThat topic and when he didn't nobody starts out as the topic for the next

holding the Washington Post\nThe notes of her own therapist do not confirm her story out of her own mouth took a therapist words were expressed Byron twenty ... twenty Thirteen better\nRefuted by her story of twenty sixteen and twenty eighty how's the possible the media does make it a big deal when her own therapist notes do not confirmed the truthfulness of her story and secondly the eye witnesses that she says for president refute\nHowever I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility or order a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had a beat the Post's let me tell you it's not I wasn't given lawyers\nFrom the defensive side that treated me with chemical out you know okay it was a very uncomfortable hearing solved it talks about equal right gender equality what are you know what I was treated right as a woman not as bad\nAs a person bringing bringing forward charges against another person you know so to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as though she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily ... calls and the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly ... that we find out she was all over the world I and also just the whole story said thank thank God for Kaine people thank God for Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd thank God for Lindsey Graham because\nBecause Brecht without Brett Kavanaugh ... Lindsey Graham stuff on there was not a Republican out there will know than Brett Kavanaugh\nNo in fact judge you know Jeff Flake hiding out in an elevator as you get to Ted Cruz type assault\nOr from some screaming woman who says look me in the ... I would've said lady I'm On your side I'm not in favor of sexual assault or trying to find out the truth you know I mean do you believe every woman who said she was sexually assaulted if that's the case the\n... the Duke lacrosse team would all be locked up and they use UVA Rolling Stone story never would have happened about ten to twenty percent of these stories are dishes eighty Ninety percent of legitimate\nWell which is you know nobody's going to have a car stolen and tell the police are just Chevy when it really is a Ford so but but in the area of sexual assault things of that character ten to twenty percent of the time\nThere's false memory or false information given very motive and in this case some Thirty years went by until twenty twenty twenty twelve when she was in a conference or their husband Rosen will be goes and marriage difficult because she wanted to front doors Thirty years later\nAnd that's the first time the therapist took notes and the therapist notes her own therapist do not confirm her story according to the Washington Post\nThen she would not give her therapist notes under HIPAA rules to the United States Senate but she gave it to the Washington Post and the nose to the therapist and not contained the named Brett Kavanaugh and ... different numbers of individuals is holding her\nSo the therapist knows the knocking firmer story in fact in obstructed or story but they send it seemed to ignore that too\n[noise] why it seems like everybody on a laptop and wants to ignore all of the holes that had not sound like you said that's what I Want to withstand a court of law and any jury that would look at the testimony would not find the evidence\nYou know I heard a lot of the feminist ... so I called them on the left I say that survivors must be believed uh well we believe that they have been assaulted but\nWe don't necessarily need to take their word for as to who if they can't protect the evidence how did\nFork at a party she wasn't drunk when she went to the party I should have six miles from the party how she got home she has a very selective memory and like I said I'm not saying something traumatic that it happened\nAnd I believe that at some point in life at some point in her life it probably did\nCraft but she did not display to me like the ... and about the proof that I needed to believe that it was Dr Brett Kavanaugh and also what saved his his wife I Do believe his father by keeping a diary a calendar of sorts\nAnd without Brett Kavanaugh's calendar it would certainly come down to jot he said she said and done a crafts want to use these weaponized sexual allegations as political tool\nI think Dr Christine for nothing more than a political ... on the Democrat Party while they choose to ignore other women who have come forward with crab credible evidence specifically against Keith Ellison that these at the end the vice chair\nThe second most powerful Democrat in the party including a candidate for and turn the channel for a Minnesota has to credible allegations with police report Dr reports text messages and allegedly a video that I can about it because that's\nProving or at least getting assignments\nHe allegedly emotionally and physically abused no less than two women\nAnd I'll give you another part of this or you know it's just like the dog that didn't bark she told the committee the primary impacted event occurred during the four years directly after she said she went on to struggle academically I struggled at a Chapel Hill and in college when\nI was Seventeen I was off to college at a very tough time\nShe skips completely her junior and senior year in high school\nI guarantee you if there were bad grades are bad behavior by her her junior and senior in high school that to academic years after the event took place when she was Fifteen Years old\nThat would have been a dog that barked we would have found out that you flunked out advice go that you did poorly and so how is it possible that you did well in high school\nGood enough to get into a Chapel Hill which is our school to get into\nGet three advanced degrees including two masters and a doctorate right sixty five books in periodicals travel all over the world to to Haiti and South America and Europe\nAnd uh in Israel and she went to a she went to Hawaii nine times she seemed objectively there'll be full life what she would have written Seventy five books except for this terrible event\nHow come we've not heard about what ... what happened to her academically entered junior and senior year I made you the reason is they looked into it\nAnd she did quite well which is the dog that did not bark and there there was no objective indicator and why would she left the house with their best friend Lieberman Kaiser girlfriends still there if there is to purported attempted rapist running around drunk\nHow'd you get out of there who took her home why didn't you notify other girls the next\nStay at the swimming club but at the country club or or the first day of class she told nobody counsellors mom and dad girlfriend she kept it secret for Thirty years been head of recovered memory\nAnd psychological services counseling session because you wanted a second front door and how is it her lawyers got away with lying\nFor ten days about her wanting to drive from California to Washington when in fact she was staying in Delaware at that time and flying all over the country why wasn't that a bigger deal goes flat outlined\n[laughter] wow that's not the another example of the Democrats using women as political pawns or tools and the political assassinations game that's just the politics of personal destruction they want it the political theater\nThey want it to expose her some on debt stomach exposed to the she was and somewhat made sure that she would have cameras and lights and the national audience in front of the\nSenate Judiciary committee that was set up in order to try to make the old white men\nOn the Senate Judiciary committee they're all white Republican to look bad you know Steve King tweeted out just the other day and I say that's the old white men are relentlessly being racially and generationally profile by the power laps and air quotes tolerant\nLeftist media outlets and politicians almost universally profiled and stigmatized Republican senators\nBooks like racial profiling us back in style if you are left us her not only as an old white men that were going to question her but Brett Kavanaugh as an old white privilege to a guy that the Sacramento Bee is that when he was crying that's just what white privilege looks like\nYeah so they they they call it a massage or their crime Republicans massage it is an old white men and that's coming directly from the vicious violent violent laughed and missing dress the feminist\nNo say this is a woman that crave unanimity\nDemanded a public forty million audience to listen to her story she was never properly cross examined\nAnd uh and the questioning from the Democrats was laughable\nAnd and at this point uh what's gonna happen later this week do you think you're making ... dot com I assume the FBI Thursday Friday is going to give largely clean bill of health that will not be sufficient Jeff Flake whose last name was should be an ... not ... not a now\nAh I I guess she's going to he's going to vote for unless he's pigeonholed by another Ted Cruz CBGB's screaming out I'm In an elevator God Knows what's going to get all your crystal ball what happens later this week [noise]\n[noise] well I'm I think I heard ... however now that we've given the Democrats or other week in this you know hard for the seven FBI investigation I've quit having a\nI'm sure that Michael I have an oddity or maybe gory alright well up here with another victim I mean right now they're probably scraping the Yale yearbooks to see what they can come up with\nBecause the truth doesn't matter to the Democrats it's simply the perception chemically the narrative and they can use their buddies and the media in order to further to the same and destroy\nA potentially and allegedly a superbly innocent man but they can try to ruin him in a court of public opinion because it benefits that politically\nAnd Megan they couldn't care less about sexual assault victims they couldn't care less about Christine forward\nWhy the league tour identity to have ... they wanted to weaponize sexual assault the way they weaponize the Oscars the way they weaponize television shows the way they
