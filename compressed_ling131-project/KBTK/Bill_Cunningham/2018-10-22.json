I came here legally how much are the policies here I'm like I might as well as the legally might have been faster to do it that way but no\nWe want to the house you know now that I'm here I can I can talk freely I can enjoy the free market system\nThe the western culture western civilization that really build something here and if you bring the ideas of socialism if you're going to mask on his social does not work\nThey talk to the Scandinavian countries but the whole that's working because we subsidize their military we all know that America's military it's what's what's keeping it for their taxes or stroll yard and I can feel it here in Connecticut\nOh no question there the reason Scandinavian country work\nIs a capitalistic parts works for the socialist party doesn't and then the other reason is they have no military we spent about eight hundred billion dollars a year in the military to protect them and they spend nothing that's why they're going to have ramping socialism socialism doesn't work in Venezuela or Cuba\nIt doesn't work in the Scandinavian countries ultimately you run out of the ability to spend other people's money in Milton Friedman one of the great signals of all time about three years ago that you cannot have\nA first world country and open borders next to a grinding third world poverty eventually it'll blend together it'll take down the first war of the country America will be taken down if millions of Central Americans or poorly educated with no skills that we need\nSome air and collapse of social welfare state and overrun the hospitals in the schools in the prison America cannot long succeed it's the failure of our country\nI mean it's amazing 'cause when I come here and I see the fact that America watch some some some sovereignty\nI I can respect that as something that goes back to you I come from Niger and those who could never work there because it's across the state we end up everyone in the socialists or a society believe this utopian\nYou can you can walk out no I'm Sorry it's human nature\nIt kept plus works on human nature to try the free market if you look at the fact that capitalism has bought half\nHas cut global poverty in half and twelve years and sort of it is a un donor's and I told thirty because apple is it's it's it's really from fire it's probably the first ... I'm trying to get I think education is the key\n'cause if if I'm able to tell people hey listen you don't like them but it will get the results I mean a lot for me it's the lowest in history I'm like\nHow he got to look at Bill Clinton was an ad for high end President Obama's record high welfare recipients and now ... is like businesses like this is his up four hundred percent um I'm\nI'm just looking at the numbers here\nAnd I'm like okay he wasn't called racist until he started running I'm like I'm looking at the joke you know what they're offering they're offering\nActual filled Beck and wears socialism ads his ideas that just never just never panned out\nAnd it's ...

the Democrats are now they have such a stranglehold on the black community for no reason\nH if we can if we'll get over that if we if we can because like for example if it was horrible historic event they watched that the struggle to Japanese and talk on the ... to the U.S some reason [noise] I think it's because I'm an immigrant so it's not exactly something that\nIt was in court treated as if you go through the public schools I went to ... ... the Hitler but they never talk about the hundred living under communism so that history just vantage is and and I think education is the key I definitely do\nWell ... we got to go but I Want you to stay alert stay alive keep preaching the faith in Connecticut\nIt's one of the parts of the country that badly needs the shot of capitalism conservatism the worst run states in America are controlled by the Democratic party and the best run states in America are controlled by the Republican Party but thanks for your call let's continue with more\nI'm number to call in or to Corey Lewandowski urine about five minutes see was the campaign manager for Donald Trump from like a year and a half\nAnd I'm going to ask him about the immigration crisis when I look at the Drudge Report tonight look stimuli goal hills breaking loose and ABC and NBC and CNN thinks this is the vehicle they're going to drive for the next two weeks and two days to bring down the Republicans in Congress and I said oh contrary moons prayer I Believe\nThe three reasons Trump got elected was number one the economy number two immigration number three federal judges he's performed magnificently in all three areas\nWas stripping nude in the oval office performing sex act in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure you might sell a lot of\nLot of his songs and records and that\nCan you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad depicted Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office in performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was ...\nIt would be front page news for a week on and that wrap that the the country artist would have had his life probably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just again about a week ago\nHillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her I mean do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was\nNo it was appropriate because she was an adult he was the president of the United states\nAnd leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton still justifying her husband's behavior\nCan you imagine for one second that was the the converse if Donald Trump had done that with during the media would be saying oh\nYeah they would give them an excuse drawn away and I'm sure the media was saying well she's an adult no big deal I mean the double standards amazing\nIt has always been that way but the American people have seen through it and as you've referenced as it relates to read those Ninety two percent of the media coverage of this president negative now I Would accept that if we were in the middle of twenty\nFive percent unemployment a national crisis all over the place nobody working and the country moving in the wrong direction growing at point zero zero percent I Would expect that but\nWe're not we are we are now back up on top where the most competitive country in the world again for the first time in ten years and there is no credit for what this press has done right or wrong but twenty Americans who've been held hostage in other countries\nThat he got returned not with plane loads of cash though at palette loads of money but on his own share and we don't forget these people back\nYou know you saw a pastor come back just a week or so ago and\nThat was it was a blip on the radar screen the president's getting twenty Americans either and North Korea and Egypt or wherever they have been home that's part of his job and he gets no credit for that but in the mainstream media bronco bottle would have been in line for another Nobel Peace prize\nWell let's talk a little bit about what's happening in Honduras in Guatemala there's at least three thousand the numbers are growing coming from a Honduras through Guatemala into Mexico\nAnd the mainstream media hate\nThis kind of an issue percolating a little over two weeks ... from the election because it reminds the American people one of the main reasons Trump was elected was to curtail illegal migration from Central America and Mexico into our country there's a I like Google this information there is a hundred and fifty million\nMexicans ... doors in El Salvador and hundred and fifty million not like to come to America if you throw in Venezuela and Colombia maybe Peru\nA Europe wide Paraguay I were talking to a hundred and fifty million\nOr central and South American would love to come to America at what point is enough is enough and the mainstream media does not want to call it illegal immigration and they talk about refugee status and they're talking about the factors moms and dads and children there in strollers\nHowever uh four or five months ago I fell off the couch one night I'm watching sixty minutes and sixty minutes did a report on the reality of our southern border\nHundreds of dead bodies are found and the deserts of northern Mexico because men are killed because they will become drug meals and that when these individuals\nPaying MS Thirteen literally millions of dollars to transport them from Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Mexico into American when this is funding in fueling MS Thirteen dry to make literally hundreds of millions of dollars\nEvery county so to speak they passed through in Mexico has a drug war and order and somebody in charge of that county and that men have got to pay with money and women have to pay their bodies and sixty minutes made the point that the majority of young girls and women are raised on the way from Central America\nTo to the United states and when it's reported which is not done by the mainstream media that this has been extremely dangerous route\nThat men are murdered and that women are raped and brutalized all the way up Fifteen hundred miles\nAnd then when they get a new American that they're they're not released many times you go work in a brothel going on in Austin you go to Baton Rouge and working abroad or if you're a man you sent you stand on street corners to sell drugs which is paying back your transit the there there was one report on sixty minutes about the reality\nOf what the Democratic Party's encouraging and it was disgusting why don't we have more media coverage Corey Lewandowski campaign manager for some\nOf the reality of what happened to the men and women incentivized to come to this country because what happened to them and so despicable because the Democratic party should be held accountable for some of this why does the media cover it objectively\nThe media doesn't want to tell the real story they want to pretend that the only people who are coming to this country the poor and impoverished that are seeking asylum and and look we're the greatest\nCountry in the world and not only do they two hundred and fifty million people from South in Central America want to come here people from all over the world want to come here but we are not a country if we can't control our borders Ronald Reagan said that you know Thirty years ago we are the greatest country in the world and the greatest privilege we can give somebody is to make them a citizen\nAnd there is a way to do that but just coming in and storming the borders doesn't work but your point is much more important what takes place with these people and they make this track from Honduras through Mexico and ultimately up to the U.S border is\nDisgusting display of gangs that take advantage of these people they raped women they kill them and and you're exactly right even if they have the opportunity to make it into our country illegally those people aren't free and we have to do something about human trafficking we have to make sure that that doesn't count\nTuned to make it into our country illegally those people aren't free and we have to do something about human trafficking we have\nTo make sure that it doesn't continue the best way to do that is you build a wall on the southern border and you say if you make it to the United states you will not make it into our country and they were they process to come here and you follow the process we're a nation\nOf laws and what we will do as a Republican Party has to make sure\nThat the immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have all the tools necessary to apprehend people coming across the border illegally\nAnd like the Democrats who want to be fun and de legitimize the men and women who serve an ice every day that protect us from the animals of MS Thirteen and those gangs\nCorey Lewandowski why do the Democrats want this because there can be no change in the law until ten or so United States senators who are Democrats agree to that change which is build a wall brings insanity I think we need temporary workers to come and go when you come you or do we know who you are\n... we have a big wall with lots of doors in it and every legitimate person wants to come here to to work whatever ought to be able to do it but the the the byproduct of that would it be do a lemonade drug a heroin and math in Cincinnati in Austin in Tampa in Milwaukee\nBy by doing it makes it more difficult for drugs to come in more difficult for him is Thirteen what is the real reason the Democratic party does not one controlling southern border\nBecause they love a political issue and they don't want to resolve the issue look\nThis president went out and say you give me the money for the wall and all the people that are here through no fault of their own what's arguably called the dream where they came in through no fault of their own I Will give them the president said a pathway to citizenship and that was a long way to go for conservatives to be very honest with you there was a lot of consternation when he made that statement\nBut he gave the Democrats exactly what they've argued they wanted for a long time\nAnd they said no we're not going to give that to they want to have the political football they want to continue to make sure that the people coming across the border\nIllegally and going to sanctuary cities in centuries states have the opportunity to vote we now see this in Texas and we've seen in other places that they are targeting individuals who are not us citizens and asking them to go and vote they they are\nBought and sold by the Democratic party those illegal immigrants coming in here and they want to keep that flow to continue it doesn't make sense to me is our first obligation is to the people in this country to make sure they're safe and secure and we\nAbsolutely need immigration there are jobs that we need them to come and fill on a temporary basis\nBut you're exactly right it come through the system your check you are authorized to come and you pay whatever fair share it is there is either vacation and then when your job is done you go back to your country and that's how it works that that was always work and we just need to know better job enforcing that\nCorey Lewandowski Leslie there's been some speculation that a Hillary Clinton\nIs making a run and twenty twenty you know I think Hillary Clinton did a great job as first lady\nShe was a wonderful United States senator she was a fabulous secretary's day and she was a wonderful candidates for the Democratic party in twenty sixteen I Would encourage her to run I Would help her get signatures maybe raise the money for would you encourage Hillary Clinton\nTo become the Democratic party's standard bearer standard bearer and twenty twenty would you do a great job\nWe were in love this look in thirty two electoral votes two years ago that number is only going down she wouldn't be up for
