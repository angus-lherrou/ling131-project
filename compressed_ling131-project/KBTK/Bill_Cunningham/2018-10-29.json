just farther to the point that I was getting at it's like this doesn't sound like mommy style mommy I couldn't understand what was going on\nI was recorded that at one point\nIn the federal registrar there was a century our team put out there in Ninety Days they wanted beds on watching companies to move kids from unknown places unknown cities put on the southern border of the United states to unknown destination\nTo be better on a mileage bitter essentially like we'll figure that out later you tell us what these are because they had to publish at the register\nOf course in ... under Obama\nThe wide open borders dispersed around America you know one third of all living al Salvadorans living out in El Salvador they live in America we have every week about two thousand showing up at our southern border two thousand a week yeah put it in the numbers it's a hundred thousand or more\nA I'm Sorry not a week two thousand per day\nWe have seven hundred thousand a legal showing up at

investigation of what happened in Pittsburgh later on a Sam Nunberg will be here works with Steve Bannon on his way out to Nevada to talk about the Trump media\nThat social media exacerbates highlight these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate before social media ten twelve years ago you sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people\nOf like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against ah against Jews and against African Americans every several hundred did that they use social media to get together and feed they feed on each other and feed on their hey now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump\nHe he he'd previously wrote I never voted for Trump nor a vibrant own Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\n... but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so when you went in NYPD or you go back right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say\nWhat did he do when did he do it who did you send these messages to and investigate them as to why something wasn't done and about the guns right now according to media counts three fifty seven magnum since and blocks that were legally purchased than they are Fifteen just don't track and nothing down and see what it is\nA ... if someone is posting anti Semitic slurs and\nSaying I'm going in and they have guns now isn't that another tempted something's about to happen\nThat's what you would hope you would hope for the polish Pittsburgh Police departments standpoint that you would have gotten a call or the FBI would have gotten a call and then if you drop the oil is a law enforcement agency is on you but in this case nothing I have seen about ... hours\nShowed anything\nTo indicate that he was becoming radicalized and he was becoming what we call lone wolf\nAnd it was going to do something other than his rants till right before you went in yesterday when he said I'm going in and if police knew about it and that will come to light if they didn't then why didn't someone else who saw this alert police\nThomas rust can you some doubt how many other Robert Bowers are running around this country and I would assume there are several thousand just like him\nA nation that three hundred and forty million people\n... and let's face it in America is the most pro Jewish pro is your is Israel especially with with Trump in the White House nation on the face of the earth\nAnd this is the place or were were were were Jews do well and there's about three million or so three and a half million Jews in America disproportionately successful you know it's a faith and family because the connections to go some hard work because of academics disproportionate success\nAnd so those who are jealous or whatever they got to have a scapegoat\nFor the failures in their life\nAnd they look at someone successful so many Jews disproportionately succeed in business and entertainment and finance and the law in Madison and I found it so electorate said that\nThis afternoon on CNN there was an interview of a doctor\nWho treated Bowers who unfortunately lived in that doctor is Jewish at the Pittsburgh hospital in a couple of the nurses who treated him and saved his life for Jewish isn't that unbelievable that that that somehow powers were saved by by Jews in the hospital unbelievable\nCould have been a Jewish cop who responded to the Senate or to to save other people people in their\nProfession to be doctors lawyers the emergency areas being doctors police officers firemen don't look at who they're saving or what they've done they know what they're sworn to do and that's what they do and that's what the doctors and hospitals even though\nHe had killed eleven Jewish people innocent a God who ... their prey\nSaved his life and that's what they do and that's what cops too and that's what firemen do and that's what these doctors and God Bless them for that\nI was talking about Cesar ... who was the\nMentally ill deranged individual they ran around in the white van I guess his band was he was an attempt to bomb making factory some have said when someone in a white man has those kinds of ah a Heidi Asians on the side CNN sucks also had scopes on Hillary Clinton in bronco bomber\nThat something should have been done in your years in New York City as the ... how many unusual situations like that did you observe\nMore than I can count\nBut I Will tell you this you know there are laws and there are reasons for stopping someone and questioning them\nAnd maybe he didn't violate the law the fact that he's expressing his First Amendment right to express speech on the outside of his car doesn't necessarily give you a right\nTo pull him over and or a question in my last he violates some other kind of law now we don't even know if the police had any interaction with him relative to his fan as of yet down there\nBut you know at the point in time I'm sure\nWhere it went down to about ... aka\nA Florida with the bombs had been sent proved that distribution center\nAnd then in the area plantation where he was taken into custody I wouldn't be surprised to certain people start to make calls on him prior to the police\nCome in contact with him or learning his identity through his finger print and that was tying in simultaneously with them identifying\n... is the potential bomber\nAnd you know these acts of terror are taking place sadly quite frequently just on Wednesday\nHey criminal who sent a rise in light materials to the home of US

could get to play it out of a malfunctioning knife\nThere are numerous examples in the last several months\nWhere powder scent where are the candidates are sent with their heads decapitated ... and I I Can't recall a time other than the late Nineteen sixty sixty eight when the country paired almost to be to be coming apart the Drudge Report says that the usa on edge\nDo have a sense that something is different about the political climate now than it's been years ago Thomas rescued\nThe rhetoric on both sides of the world have become this rural and have become terrible and we have to dial it back I mean I've said numerous appearances recently that if this continues on a leash or going to be busier than they've ever been before it's not\nJust Donald Trump and not just the right is for\nEveryone has to understand the McCain way of thinking\nThat we have to work together we can have our political views and we can look at things from different lenses that are different experiences and how we were growing up all Americans and if we're not able to work with each other or help each other or save each other the way that they do after a hurricane\nAnd the way the police officers around this country to every single day they don't look at the color whether religion or the\nPerson that they're saving they respond because that's what they wanted to do and they risk their lives to save anyone to think potentially could save because that's what they're calling\nAnd I I don't know I like the president I I Love the guy spent time with him we speak now and then he's a great political character I look at his results\nMore than look at his words but I I don't recall words being used by him along the lines of the word at least is president then I hear on the left but\nThe media covers the Trump words differently and then they covered that democratic words\nAnd uh and I I Wish there was a quality between the two but as you said the election now is on a little more than a week away and at this point it would behoove all or most of the lower down to ... rhetoric a little bit because there's hundreds of thousands on the left and on the right\nNow they're waiting it'd be triggered by some event in many are mentally ill and many have guns now that doesn't mean any of us Tom Russ get needs to stop exercising or free speech rights on their constitution but\nIt does mean that the media also plays a role in this one I've been watching CNN the past two days all I hear about is Trump and the Republicans responsible\nFor almost a mass murder of two former presidents plus the killing of twelve or fourteen others along with the attempts to to tide Donald Trump to what happened in Pittsburgh even though he's the only president in American history you have Jewish grandchildren the only one\nAnd today CNN tried to tee up to us a Israeli ambassador the is the Israeli ambassador to the u._s. I'm Sorry\nAnd he said that the best friend Israel's ever had has been Donald J Trump and that he's been wonderful for Israel and Trump has not responsible for what happened there the president's

help Dean Heller keeping Tennessee plus one or two congressional seats which will be a great thing for those and many of the important states like Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn or Florida with Governor Scott\nOr a course Nevada and uh I think north North Dakota is gone to the Republican thank God high camp has gone even a West Virginia how do you vote for Joe mansion\nWhen he votes for someone like Senator Chuck Schumer to be the Democratic leader how do you do that\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen a\nPictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift uh not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably\nTwo or Jimmy Carter's a election downfall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by left this government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance\nBecause it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent\nOf the so called the migrants are young males between the ages of Fifteen and thirty it's impossible for a woman with a baby to walk two thousand miles\nThrough jungles in the heat and sand in desert that ain't gonna happen somebody's organizing on this much like the boat live from Juba there are lumped as politicians who hate Trump and want to destroy America and they want to flood the southern border right now there's Fifteen and twenty thousand one hundred Fifteen to twenty million\nWell you know there are forty one million people in Central America and I bet a good deal of them have their eyes on what's happening here and how we handle it the problem is that we have gaping loopholes in our asylum laws and if anyone in this caravan no matter what even if they said on national television ten times\nThat they're coming here for a job as you've heard people say all I Want is a job in Los Angeles when they put one toe in the United states they say the words political asylum and they are in like Flynn\nThey are here they are going to be released into the country and they're going to be on a backlog of probably as long as three to four years never showing up for their cases eighty percent of these folks who exploit the asylum loopholes never show up for their cases and simply disappear into the United states\nThis is a gimmick they're using our own policies twice this year the Republican Congress has tried to close these loopholes and they have not had a single democratic vote\nTo uh to do so and you asked to ask yourself why who really benefits in the long run for Massey illegal immigration when you look at studies of immigrants as they become citizens and how they vote sixty five percent of them ended up registering his Democratic\n... forgot to government assistance but they all yeah I mean you're barely making it you're going to vote for the party that hands you the most goodies and\nAh you know twenty five percent a vote Republican but if you think about you know twelve million illegal aliens a sixty five percent of them would end up becoming citizens and voting Democrat that would that would that have thrown every American election to the Democrats in the last Twenty years and everyone for probably the next forty\n... and the other issue you read and democratic literature is that if and when Texas flip to the Democratic party and becomes a deep blue state\nThe way the politics who will be fashion for the next twenty to fifty years there'll be no chance for a Republican ever to win the presidency again in Texas is a blue state and you might throw in Florida because California for most of them it's history was a deep red state Ronald Reagan heritage easily Nixon carried raised like\nCalifornia flip it goes of legal migration\nHair right who's in the next target Texas flips and it's over but David Wray affair here here's a question\nTrump is talking in the way I Would like him to talk he's normal he reflects mid western values conservative values\nHe's saying the army or the national guard will not let them crossed in America how do you physically stop maybe twenty or thirty thousand people in mass from getting one home into American soil then blaming political refugee status how physically we're not going to shoot them\nThere's well ... how do you actually stop 'em\nThat's the million dollar question without going into Mexico because I really think\nThat that is the question and I don't know that anybody has the answer to that I'll tell you how you would stop them if it existed Trump's border wall if you had a border wall there they wouldn't be walking in the United states except through legal ports of entry or they would have to walk way out into the desert in Arizona that come over\nThat's why we need the border wall and some of these heavy crossing points but that's all it takes\nIs one ... in the United states\nAnd we're done and you and you're done and orange on the long\nList oh yeah and all we need to do is and so fair has called called we believe this is the beginning of a national emergency just like the Mariel boatlift was we've asked that Congress the president calls Congress back to Washington\nThis week to close these asylum loopholes if we could close these asylum loopholes or if we could put asylum courts with detention centers right on the border so as they can\nIt could close these asylum loopholes or if we could quit asylum courts with detention centers right on the border so as they came over\nSet ask for political asylum they have their hearing and they were immediately sent home because Ninety nine percent of these folks would not qualify ... for political asylum their economic migrants than we would have an end to this nonsense we can't get those loopholes closed have Congress failed twice\nThey're going to we think they should come back and close these loopholes anything short of that\nAnd and it's kind of a a you know a cat and mouse game we have to try to keep them from getting in you know\nHundreds of probably very forward takes ten\nDemocrats the United States Senate to move legislation right now there's fifty one there might be fifty four fifty five after the election\nWhatever the number is unique numerous Democrats to switch party line vote with the Republicans in order to say that much like Mexicans of Mexicans come here and they get one foot in the taxes they're thrown back immediately into Mexico and you're done\nWe every loophole in the law that says your ... from Central America Asia Africa\nAnd you make it through America no matter how you get her legally or illegally\nAnd you claim refugee status for political purposes\nThat then you begin in the hearing process that takes three to ten years so unless the Democrats agree to do this no change in the law will happen I mean Trump God Bless him I Love him or he can tough tough all he wants\nBut you cannot stop twenty thousand people or twenty million people from flooding our southern border from Central America\nClaiming refugee status they have no shots they have no medical Clarence them no financial support they have no work shows that we need most of us than a third grade education and there's nothing we can do to stop them unless the Democratic party agrees and what makes you think they're ever going to agree\nWell I mean at some point maybe they're going to put the national interest to their own political interests is that my pipe dream yeah\nNo it won't happen now that's why I feel bad I feel terrible yeah\n[noise] yeah I mean the president really is extremely limited in what he can do and his best bet is to try to get the Mexican to stop them in Mexico because once they get to the U.S border they're going to walk\nYou know five miles outside of the port of entry and they're going to step right over a fence and they're going to be in the United states hoping that they get apprehended in fact if they see the border patrol don't run towards them\nTo ask for political asylum and then it's all over and until we get these detention facilities on the border with these asylum courts as we did in the late Nineteen nineties when Central Americans were pulling this a stick with us till we get that back\nIn turn these cases around and get these asylum loopholes or a close we are going to be stuck with this mess\nI mean I I don't know I'm filled with hope all the time but I yeah unless\nMexico says to the Trump bring the United States Army one or two or three miles into Mexico and politically that would be the death knell of the Mexican president if he allowed American Soldiers on the Mexican territory that ain't gonna happen and the other thing is not going to happen is the Mexican president was elected\nAnd I just recently under an open borders policy and what she wants free flow of information I don't know what we can do other than bitch complain and moan and at the end of the day the Democrats aren't going to agree to this and so unless they get hammered at the at the ballot box and Nancy plus it goes down hard a week from Tuesday and the\nDemocrats get hurt in the Senate ... ... ... we don't need we need about ten Democrats the United states senators to give the same treatment as Central Americans that we get the Mexicans ... which means if here illegally immediately sent back don't have to go through a hearing process the liberal activists attorneys are there\nAre the news media is their Kamala Harris and all the rest are just loving this and the gold David raid there thinking strategically is make Texas a deep blue state and if that happened that Republicans are D. U. N. and done\nWell you know it it's a great political strategy if you're a Democrat because they're scaring American way left and right so you're only option left us to import future citizens and they are going to do that from Central America and\nYou know perhaps that explains why they're sitting on their hands while we have caravans of a tens of thousands of people coming towards our southern border this ... of actually be stopped by Congress until then Trump can build his wall", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "29"}
