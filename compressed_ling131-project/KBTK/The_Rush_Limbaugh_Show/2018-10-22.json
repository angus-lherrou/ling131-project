thousand illegal immigrants marching towards our southern border the president just spoke\nOut about it I'm going to play some of what he said at the bottom of this half hour out if those reports are all accurate it's a whole lot bigger than previously reported and growing\nAnd what you have is members of the caravan chanting guess we could as they're making their way through Mexico all day to day I've been defied the will of one country vowing to test the spine of another\nMexican police who failed to stop them at the country's border with Guatemala now service that sports that appears for the care of honor is there now battling north\nAs members clear that they have no intention of staying in Mexico Leah buys for the U.S new estimates cited by L. universal which is a Mexican newspaper say the Caribbean now has fourteen thousand people many of them are already in Mexico while others do wait\nOh that would put them in the category of illegal immigrants not an asylum seekers because you're seeking asylum you have to seek it in the country that you first appearance they appear confident that\nThis confrontation is going to come down to this is this is extraordinarily dangerous for the country here but I Am telling you\nPolitically the American people fundamental is white Kavanaugh matter they believe in the in the core values that this country was built on a due process and presumption of innocence they also believe that we are a nation of laws otherwise why have the\nAnd yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh\nCan you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly\n[noise] um so

from El Salvador arrested right in front of me\nUh I've been at the drug warehouses which I've played it many times I've seen the tunnels that of that had been dug\nThis is not just I mean this is the biggest rushed we've had but on top of it and maybe they think that Gavin Newsom is going to win and they can all go to the sanctuary state of California and there'll be safe and get the free health care the Gavin Newsom as promising every Californian legal not legal wherever you come from free health care free free free\nGood luck for the people of California when that disaster happens\nBut you know you you watch this\nAnd it's not one Democrat thing one thing about this because they've always supported open borders now did they not know that by\nPriests precipitating this confrontation that there could be innocent people that end up getting hurt here\nI guess for them they would use that as just another reason to hate and blamed Donald Trump\nYou know or maybe they're hoping the Trump won't do anything and that was all talk no action they don't have any legitimate claim for asylum in America because you that would be the first country they go to the way they have so we can send them back immediately if we have to\nBut if you have five seven fourteen thousand people confronting our troops along the border what good is going to come out of this\nYou know it's some you know while they're breaking the law they're criminals there not respecting our laws and our sovereignty and at the end of the day\nIf you let intense fourteen thousand what's gonna happen next week and
