I've been reminded here one thing to keep\nIn mind folks when when you hear any leftist talking about white or white privilege what that translates to is power remember what the American Left is and it really serves to understand is\nThe American left today despises America as founded and this may be a bit of a simplification but I Do this\nOrder to communicate and be understood and it's very s in the modern day American Left as taught and educated\nThe past two generations through middle school high school and college that's been taught to hate America because America is unjust from our founding days because it was founded by white men\nAnd white men founded a place for themselves they floated everybody else and everybody else has been getting the short end of the stick for over two hundred plus years\nAnd only now\nIs the awareness insensitivity to this day and realized only now are the victims of this white privilege of this white power only know art bait standing up and demanding to be hurt only now are there are rising up in righteous indignation and demanding fairness and ...\nAnd the only way that can happen is for the white power structure white\nReplaced by a coalition of all of those who have been victimized\nSegregated punished\nMistreated abuses what have you Byron them reclaiming or not reclaiming but claiming what his just lay there\nAnd that is America and its political systems and that's what young people have been taught and now\nAs as evidenced by that column I wrote by a red by Alexis Grinnell or any other of these militant feminists

there they count on everybody caving they count on everybody's suing for peace until Donald Trump came along\nDonald Trump doesn't cave he doesn't sue for peace and he doesn't power to them he calls them out it makes perfect sense they would despise Donald Trump would make perfect sense if they feared Donald Trump it makes perfect sense that they say to him\nHe refuses to play ball\n\n[noise] look at what they've attempted to force for I'm I'm a country this whole Russian collusion thing Trump Russia collusion that's a classic illustration of the left attempting to force\nWhat they want people to thing happened on the American people using everything in their arsenal they have the media they have the deep state\n\nThey had never Trump or is on the Republican side they had all kinds of allies and a special counsel with an unlimited budget sixteen or Seventeen Trump behaving lawyers slash investigators and still\nNothing because there has been pushed back when there is push back on the left they will fail they can fail they have gotten accustomed to there being no pushback they've gotten accustomed to Republicans being afraid of them end afraid of the media\nAnd it's this

you could live forever and be on the airwaves forever\nI intend to ... thank you very much I'm just a quick question for you um you know I think that the\nSenators knew they weren't going to get the votes\nOf the Democrat senators that is to oppose Kevin are and make make sure he's not on the bench and the Supreme Court so I was wondering [noise] um do you think that the way they framed him with the media is something they're going to use later on to find the entire Supreme Court\nWhen they don't get their way bingo\nThat's already begun the de legitimize position of the Supreme Court has already been gone why none other than the woman that hired and taken sorry that's her name the woman at higher capital to teach at Harvard\nSimply because they are capable in fact [noise] let's see there's actually a story with\nMany here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack but it is it is a woman making the point that Kavanaugh is as good as guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man\nHe could have done it because he has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe ball the forward that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons\nAnd a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this you wouldn't miss\nWhat is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the allegation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there is no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to what happened\nBecause that's what men do be cause\nMen can and men\nCan because they have the genitalia necessary to do it I don't know if you're an average ordinary decent woman watching this stuff how in the world you want to sign onto that well you don't\n\nAnd so now these leftist women aren't enraged when they have discovered that they failed to persuade\nA bunch of average ordinary white women to join their cause anti Kevin Ball so now these women are sellouts and their universes are sellouts and their rooms are cello and they're selling out to the patriarchy and as such they become worthless\nAnd even the liability to the point now that here we have a soundbite with two women experts in gender studies saying\nDo we need white women\nGet to the electoral question every candidate needs to ask let me remind you in November of two thousand eleven the Obama presidential campaign was was written about by a Thomas and so all in the Washington Post might have been to New York times\nOn downs that they were for going the white working class as a voting bloc and instead we're going to put together a winning coalition of a sum total of every\nMinority group they can find they were going to combine all these minority groups and make that the Democrat base because white working class voters were becoming less and less\nDependable because they weren't buying Obama an Obamacare and because of that they were becoming racist a traditional Democrat little guy voting bloc they\nExpressed ... this is simply an evolution of that\nSo while the white working class was totally go pounds sand by the Obama campaign two thousand eleven now in two thousand Eighteen\nDo we need white women it's an electoral questions if every candidate needs to ask\n... folks illnesses now to misunderstand what I'm doing here I'm not doing this simply doing expressed in the credibility of\nThis\nDoing this under the auspices of how in the world can a majority or mainstream of Americans in any way support this party\n\nI realize I'm setting myself up here for what might be a major shocking disappointment the day after the election in November and I'm not making any predictions here I'm just I'm I'm I'm genuinely curious\n\nI just don't see how the actions words the policy is the attempts to inspire and persuade I just\nI don't see how any decent normal people fall for this\n\nI realize that Democrats have educated a lot of people in the last two generations\nI realize a lot of college educated people have come out of these institutions that may have been corrupted and polluted with this crap and since most people are not what they wish they were most people are not as successful as they ... want to be\nMost people do think about what they don't have rather than what they do\nAnd if that's who you are if that's if that's the personality type then it's not very big step to start blaming somebody else for what you don't have\nBecomes very easy to blame some faceless patriarchy some faceless white privilege power structure some faceless Montreal mean ease\nDepriving you denying you discriminating against you\n\nAlthough that has to do is get hold of people who have not amounted to what they want to amount to do they have what they had hoped to have it anyway materially professionally you name it other words it's not hard to run onto unhappy people it's not challenging to find a bunch of people that are\nMeeting themselves up and all you have to do is ... is is convinced those people that\nSomebody else did it to the Republicans but white privilege power structure did it too and there's only one way to fix it and that's the wipe 'em out I Know they've educated a lot of people to believe this now\nAnyway back to the phones we go in a moment to solve the clock QuickTime out back with
