fact that I'm are laying it to you is all you need to know that that that I'm taking it somewhat seriously ... at least to the point that it's interesting I'm not endorsing any of this box I don't I'm not familiar enough with the data myself\nI just have instincts and I like process information like everybody else and I'm just telling you\nI I don't know how things are going to end up but I Do know that none of this is the way the Democrats in the media thought this was going to play out\nThere isn't any blow wave and even they are beginning to pull back from that now even they are beginning to admit that there isn't\nOne and it could be big trouble um\nNBC Wall Street Journal poll Politico these kinds of places are pulling back from it I don't think there ever was going to be a blue wave this was my point I think we've been lied to\nWe've had a media soap opera a narrative that has been part of the effort to defeat Trump at Republicans for the last year starting with a generic ballots last December so it it but regardless however the Democrats are telling a story themselves however they're lying or whatever it isn't\nIt isn't unfolding as they expected they expected to be able to make a blue wave happen just by predicting it just by talking about and just by reporting stories made the looked like it was happening QuickTime out we will continue your phone calls on the other

your own ... nothing at all from Smith climbed Barney\n[noise]\n\nHere's another story this from Bloomberg News holes could be missing a Republican syringe\nHere's why certainly looks like Democrats will do well in the midterms but this cycle present some unusual risks for pollsters not ... the mainstream media does this every election cycle\nWhere it was all this down for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys assuring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's got to be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge\nLate surge and guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls picked it up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys can miss late change the story written before the bombs could it happen again it probably won't don't worry about Bloomberg says\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the ah the Swedes here it's really strange ah ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans they use this caravan which is so obviously a set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose\nThere is a translation for this in addition to what are you saying here you Democrats have got to stop posing Trump just to oppose Trump\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are\nIllegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we we know from a couple of sources\nThat Venezuela sponsored and paid for this if that if that's true then Venezuela also means Iran and the child comes folks\nA lot of people on our side have jumped say George Soros yeah maybe but if Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying as Venezuela if it's Venezuela it's also Iran and the ... regardless\nWe had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates unless those people and for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not one of the American people are right now\nThe only common sense a cool thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore Avon lady is saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security this doesn't help us\nA modest seven thousand ten thousand people starving engaged demanding to be let in\nThat doesn't help us whatever now do you see all this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickled kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\n[noise] my point is [laughter] none of this is panning out the way it was planned no blue wave\nI ... don't misunderstand I don't know what's good I'm not saying that the Democrats may not win the house but\nI I don't think they're going to [noise] I I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it because I never fall for left wing media conventional wisdom or the standard ordinary groups think narrative of the moment whenever it is\nBut it's more than that there is nothing happening in America right now that argues electing Democrats\nNot in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in mass\nThere is no reason to vote Democrat even giving people reasons to vote for the ball they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump because Trump's what he's aboard he tweets he's a bad guy his whatever whatever is\nThe stunts the Democrats are pulling destroying Kevin on his family sending rice in what looked like rice and the Susan Collins all these monsters nothing the Democrats are doing\nThat's the kind of thing you do to build a movement in a decent society and I still believe that we have one I Believe are decent society is under siege every day are decent society standard\nGood old normalcy is under assault everyday led by pop\nAnd leftist in Hollywood in Silicon valley and the drive by media we're under assault every day but they have not overturned that yet they have not\nGotten to the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced normal there's just nothing out there to me\nThat would have people excited about voting for Democrats because the the even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people to vote against Trump against Republicans\nAh I just I don't see it we'll find out if my instincts are off the charts or not\nIn less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it\nStinks or off the charts you're not in less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters they're the ones panicking so you flip this scenario what\nSense does it make for a conservative Republican the gum up the works here by sending a bunch of bombs that are not going to go off and that are going to be discovered\nDoesn't make any sense\nAny way shape or form a yup break time back with more after this hang\nOn Russia's always at work and he I have never closes Fifteen hours a week here what is there not says it turns
