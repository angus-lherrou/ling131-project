Democrats are dropping the ball with Latinos why is she saying that well because she has the freedom to say that she's not at the moment in the in the hierarchy of the apparatus and it\nTurns out the Latino are far more supportive of Trump Republicans in anybody know according to recent polling data that Democrats are done after a number of Latino those that are signing on with Republicans and Trump the reason there's long just because they believe that all Latino is\nShould despise anybody who is\nAnti illegal immigration or wants to build a wall the millennial thing I think what\nThat's about is voter turnout and she mentions it here everybody talks about the millennials and young people and young people that\nIt just it never ceases to be the case that election day they don't show

registrations at the same level as past election cycles\nA but but but but but but but but but\nThe Democrats had Michelle my bell out there\nDuring all do a whole big voter registration drive out there the Democrats have been registering voters in prison they've been registering voters at the DMV even registering voters at the at the at the at the medical marijuana places they've been registering voters everywhere how in the world is it\nPossible that democratic voter registration levels at the same as past cycles Democrats have been telling us that there's so much energy\nThere is so much excitement there so much motivation there's so much just ... nothing can hold them back and yet\nAnd yet the generic ballot once again is showing that this massive Democrat blue wave is not as big as once\nThought now NBC is is is very very worried they're worried that something that's not a blue wave may be shaping up here\nThat's what the headline is ... certainly they over a blue wave NBC News minds Democrat and GOP voter registration at the same level as past cycles comparing registration activity for twenty four teams are twenty sixteen with activity from twenty sixty inch current helps\nPut these numbers in the context but it should be noted that twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen include I complete picture of registration for those years restaurant the Eighteen only includes registration activity up until this point in time what\nThat's all you need them if you're not registered yet the odds are you're not going to be registered in time to vote so it's that seems like a little\nHope will we don't have a pool database numbers or to do so they say well you've got enough to know\n[noise] so how can this be how can voter registration if Democrats are supposed to be smoking us in voter registration 'cause\nThere's so much more interest there so much hatred for Trump there's so many people that want to fix that mistake then they call 'em from the Washington Post by Megan McCarthy all trying to help\nThe Democrats are she believes are morally superior and smarter than Republicans\nHeadline will the blue wave collapse before it reaches the shore\nWhat Megan McCarthy all in this op ed Washington Post is doing is trying to help Democrats is saying that the Kavanaugh hearings backfired on the Democrats because it alienated man and now she's warning the Democrats\n[laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nIs a lot of pressure brought to bear on mullet\nThat are are Rosenstein whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see it go ahead and they release it and there's nothing\nThat indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks had one a week they're sixteen never Trump anti Trump hate mongers on Mueller's team if they had the garden yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue wave\nIf mother doesn't have any of that there is no way they want this release before the midterms that's why\nThey're linking ... ready they're going to try to take advantage of what they can make people think\nThe report says every member they have two years no more than that in a two and a half years of Danny reporting that Trump and Russia colluded\nSo in their minds they're probably thinking a sizable number of American voters believes the Trump Russia collusion happens so\nMueller's report is ready to be released soon create the impression that it's only a matter of time no before Trump is tied to the Russians were collusion and use that way to impact\nVoting turnout prior to the midterms I'm just going to tell you if this report doesn't advance this narrative Trump cheated installing election they're not going to want this up before the midterms\nYou man gyms I'll let down that would you don't know you don't know how many of your base\nCommon ordinary everyday democratic voters literally believe that Trump won this election by cheating with Russia you'd be done and get the number of your fellow Democrats citizens in New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco in Chicago who believe it like gospel\nDespite all realm of common sense despite every\nBit of knowledge we have that there is no evidence for just like how many of them believe ball the Ford\nTheir politics requires that they believe that it's mandates they believe that if\nThey are told before the midterms that the smaller report doesn't\nHave this evidence and will not leave the President Trump being indicted on that basis what does that do to turn out\nNow don't misunderstand I think Mueller's report whenever it is released is\nGoing to really be targeted at Trump as an incompetent\nAs a boom ... who are in danger to the United states electoral system with his hires and with some of the people on the staff like Carter Page I think they're going to fire both barrels at Trump as an incompetent who nearly brought the world to nuclear Armageddon\nBecause of his incompetence and stupidity but I don't think there's gonna be any evidence of it\nAnd the fact that there is no evidence is what tells me they don't want this out before

that I'm sure you're you're you're on this program this program is is a\nTailor and it it has the audience have has do you really think the people in this audience or seen the Fox News' audience do you think they really need to be reminded to go out and vote\nUnfortunately I think some do because um October surprises maybe Trump will do some sort of sweet as you mentioned earlier that might be\nLacking you know tone or judgment and some people in that might change some last minute ... but you know the vast majority obviously are going to vote Republican but you know just keep it out there just keep reminding them of what the alternative is\nIt somehow they decide they're on the scent of a sudden\n[noise] well I you know I Try not to do much differently as when predators be consistent uh all the time of year round and so forth um\nI kind of ... when I look at vote turnout a in an election like this I I like to assume that's why I ask you I wiped to assume that the audience of this program\nLess of a problem and it makes it much harder to hack it I mean cutting wires is easy but disrupting wife I connections takes a little bit more work\nThey use white flour and

here\n[noise] [noise] yes I Am\nA [laughter] really a a a oh listen to your to the uh the article from I Believe it was ... that are are that they're going to release the ball or a report or sometimes after the election we're ready to that yeah understand that we don't believe that\nWe're not going to believe anything Mohler says anyway\nNow that's an interesting point too I mean a lot of the ... or ...\nImplicate or the or an Obama administration and Hillary Clinton and the DNC a in a a this investigation including with Russia which they evidently did\nThen you know we're not going to believe anything that report says the\nUs I I just don't understand that the drop by media just doesn't get it they're not going to feel was people that voted for Donald Trump away from Donald Trump said I Want to understand it's like a you know the magnificent seven\nOr both guys didn't you know when it came up there they didn't they didn't check into who they ... what kind of Christians were or or or uh you know if they\nAre not lived a a good life they wanted somebody did offend them and fight against all the things that we see a which have destroyed the country over the last uh eight to ah ah sixteen years\nWell I don't think that the media is right now focused on separating Trump from his voters I think they they know that's too late I don't think that's what their objective here in the midterms is um\nI think are very frustrated they haven't been able to and if they could they would the icing on the cake but I think their primary objective\nNow is to flood the zone with anti Trump voters\nDemocrats made up of every disparate coalition a group you can find they are trying to assemble this gigantic Democratic Party and then there's like combination coalition of minority here minority that just constant Adam altogether and get a big majority party and that's that's where they're trying to generate turnout\nUm\nBecause they know they're not going to distance Trump from ah from his voters so the the focus I think is on ... up a first time participation um\nAnd that's why this this is Suzie and some thing is so important and the inspiration stuff in the anger is so that's why I think that they have strategically become the party of anger I think they are using this anger and they were exploiting it to generate turnout\nBased on what they think is the majority of Americans have hate ...\nI I think they they move past the idea that there's a bunch of Trump voters that regret it and can be inspired to show up and vote Democrat as I say if they can make that happen to be icing on the cake I think you can see the frustration in them every day you can see the frustration in\nPerusing the news as I Do more and more stories that are starting to raise red flags about the blue wave\n\nAnd there are some of the Russian foreign minister during this on purpose they're sucking you when they're making you think you're giving up they're making you think they're kind of despair or you know trying to make you think you got it in a bag no they're not going to ever\nPull that off not here not with me but\nI don't think that's the case either I I don't think that they are I Would have that much discipline to be able to have media wide threw out the entire\nLeft wing media universe a disciplined approach to runs fake stories about the blue wave not happening I think it's a legit I've never I've never believed there was gonna be a blue wave\nI never have\nI'm willing to put that out there and that if if I ended up being wrong so be it\nI'm not afraid of being wrong it doesn't happen enough times for me to be worried about it but it's this I have never thought because common sense does not suggest that like I said yesterday where is the evidence that Democrats\nHave been able to put together a winning coalitions and flooded the elections in when outside\nOf areas they dominate like New York Los Angeles San Francisco in Chicago they had been losing elections they have been losing seats left and right starting in two thousand ten that hasn't reversed\nThey didn't win with the cabinet thing they haven't won with anything trying to get rid of Trump they haven't been able to stop Trump on even they're stupid travel uh order the layers using the judge is Trump is succeeding implementing his agenda there's some things he hasn't been able to do yet like the total repeal of Obamacare\nBut they have not been able if you you would think all of these things were true of nine people hate Trump regret their votes a wish it had never happened regret that Trump is President Trump wouldn't be getting anywhere near done what he's getting done there'd be universal opposition to it if the Democrats are right about all this\nBut they're not write about it I I I\nThe evidence on the ground isn't there that there is a blue wave waiting to happen there is evidence all over the place the Democrats are Boston and fit to be tied over the fact that they're losing\nYou couple that with their their mentality that says winning is their birthright power is their birthright their entitlement but\n\nElections haven't been going their way how in the world stopped to think if all of this that they're saying is true Hillary would've won in the first Trump will never won in the first place if all this talk of a blue wave right now is true\n\nThey thought they had it in the bag and two thousand sixteen and they were revved an energized to that one of the talk of Democrats not turning out back then anyway I'm a little long
