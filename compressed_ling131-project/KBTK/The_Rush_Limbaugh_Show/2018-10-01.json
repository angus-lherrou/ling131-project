during the doctor for us the money the prosecutor asked her how to think for her legal fees and her security on as you mentioned her primary page and those three pages of grave hosted a million

this is a toughie uh in in a strict capitals sense she has identified a market and that is there are arranged lunatics who want her to be the right to hope she's telling the truth\nThey want her to continue to speak and tell you they want her lawyers to continue to strategize and screw Kavanaugh\nThey're happy to pay for it this is how they can be involved in politics beyond voting there are more than happy to paint it doesn't matter to them as she can afford her lawyers herself it doesn't matter to them that her lawyers are working pro bono because this is a political case\nSo she's identified a market there are people that want to support her with money so she starts in the Gulf on me page I actually think somebody sent me a note\nToday that uh go fund me you'll find me is not new money laundering is essentially money laundering operation for the Democrats much like the unions were a because\nThere's a lot of this money going to go a lot of this money is going to go to

if\nYou can convince the American people to support you\nWell\nI mean there's there's I don't think there's anything immediate that can be done to stop it and I don't think that you can join the conclusions\nAbout her from it um in terms of whether she's being truthful or not or if you want to draw a conclusion that the Gulf ... pages I'm I'm a way to get Democrats soccer's\nI eat voters to pay for this so that it doesn't cost people who already have a lot of money anything\nThat you could try to make that point that the Democrats are using these poor people but I don't think you're going to be able to find a way to stop this too widely you Jeff in Sarasota, Florida Hi great to have you here saw what's up\nRussia just wanted to make a suggestion or an idea it's kind of a fantasy I don't think it would ever work but\nYou know the left as always behave like bullies and they'll do anything and they've never had real pushback from our representatives on the right in Washington so you know when you know ethics and your dirty tactics I often the benefits for you coupled with the fact that\nYou know you never have to suffer the consequences yourself like a bully there's no reason to stop when\nYour tactics work there's no reason to stop and say no bully is ever stopped until they get punched in the mouth that maybe it\nGrams set it it was\nThe impassioned and that was the end of it it was never to be heard again out of the mouth of any Republican and solve\nGrams impassioned allegation of the Democrats\nWas followed by agreement with Jeff flakes\nTo me that the FBI they allowed to do one way of investigators they're ... not all of fine senator Graham's point and he even went along with with like\nYou can't do these things as one offs\nIf you're going to tell people who the Democrats are if you're going to try to inform the country and what's really going on here you have to do it every day and you're going to have to do it multiple times a day it's going to have to become the central focus of your strategy on a day to day basis\nBut it never does we've had plenty of occasions in the past where some Republicans done a one off like that and it's been great and we have celebrated we shared way to go and it dies except for here on TALK radio or maybe on Fox News but it dies\n\nWell Lindsey Graham didn't have to become them to do what he did he just has to be honest and he was\nLindsey Graham didn't have to\nWorry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people and by the when did you notice not one of them on the Democrats I carried away with about what Graham said none of even got mad at it\nNot a single one of them even want to refute if they didn't carry on and got a rise out of them was winning Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter\nSo she turned around and asked her staff did you guys Lincoln but no they said they didn't Lincoln Mr general we didn't Lincoln I just asked my staff they said they did oh what about an investigation ha well Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein ever gonna invest some of these other things that needs to be followed up on\nTheir needs to be followed through but I for one I Know investigations are innocent but I'm getting tired because all they are for or delay\n\nHow hard is it a stand up and say Brett Kavanaugh is credible and there's the Nile\nHow why is that so hard she didn't have any evidence that she made a credible witness how well she was really suffering and in may so\n\nNone of that is tablets just credibility an attitude doesn't give us credit Beverly pain and suffering doesn't equal credibility Democrats are always in pain and suffering over something\nNow want to go back to my production\nMy original prediction was that if the Republicans do not vote on this\nIf they don't vote out Kevin on that committee him he doesn't get voted on he's if he's not confirmed Republicans are going to have held a pay because voters are going to be fit to be tied up being led down again then the Democrats kept pulling stunts and it became\nConventional wisdom this games up Republican voters are going to get some kicked off Republican women and mothers are going to get so mad because they've got sons and they hate seeing what's happening with Kevin all they don't want imagine it happening there on can there are going to show up in droves well I Want to take you into the future and I want you to think about something\nIf Brett Kavanaugh just think about this is a hypothetical I'm not predicting\nIf Brett Kavanaugh is not sworn in early next week\n\nIf you can hypothetically envisions a day where Kavanaugh he has not confirmed not sworn in\nAre you going to be ... are you going to\nBe so mad that you can't wait to vote are you going to be so mad you feel betrayed because if that happens at that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he has not confirmed it in the Senate\n\nYou think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say you see what happened to Kevin all were in the majority that we couldn't get him confirmed you'll need to come out in ... how does that work\n\nThat's going to be pretty difficult asking Republicans that come out and vote to keep the majority\nWhen Kavanaugh was not sworn in as everybody thinks\nThat what voters are going to remember in November is this\nThe unfairness that Kavanaugh the dirty tricks and Democrats are playing\nBut stop and think Kavanaugh is not sworn in\nAnd the Republicans think wow we're set up now man there's so many out there were guaranteed to get their votes were going to there's going to be a Republican way of 'cause of what happened to Kevin and then the Republicans are campaigning\n\nAnd they start asking people to vote for them based on what happened to Kevin Oh you mean that he's not there you mean you didn't get sworn in\nYour that majority we know it's very small majority but you're the majority and he's not sworn in and you want us to how does this work folks\n\nMy point is it's very easy to sit here and say in the midst of all of us Democrat trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side are going to be some ticked off in his soul man they're going to show up and vote like they've never voted before\nBut is that going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in\n\nRepublicans have been asking for the majority for a long time\n\nThey keep working and voting mostly because of Trump voters do they keep showing up because of Trump\nTrump alone will be able to make the case Trump alone will be able to turn that Kavanaugh defeat and the turnout but the Republicans in the Senate and house I don't know how they do it vote for us Kavanaugh was defeated\nVote for us so it doesn't happen to the next nominee is that really effective I just don't I don't\nI hear too many people talking about it seems like every time you want a big turnout we have to do something so that people get fired up I've been hearing this since I've been doing this show back in Nineteen Ninety two people call here in San rush Clinton needs to win\nThen people will see how bad the Democrats really are people see house dogs they really are you kidding we lose and then tell ourselves we're going to win and we're still doing it here with Kevin also Kevin ... doesn't make it this is gonna really fire people up why do we have to do was to fire up the base\nThat doesn't make any sense to me it ought to be the other way around\n\nThis is another trick I think that gets played on Republicans your base is going to be really fired up you\nHave an odd doesn't make wait a minute the Republicans are the majority how in the hell\nIs is that advocacy\nFor reelection or election that the guy doesn't make it well rush voters are going to be so mad yeah yeah what the guy got real road they'll wrote it in our guys couldn't stop it and and we're supposed to say well okay\nMan we're really loaded now that's going to cause the turn up\nThe ... sorry ... I don't think it works that way\n\nWhat people in in the hypothetical I just gave you what's gonna happen is that\nVoters are going to be out there saying even what we both Republicans and Democrats still run down\n\nAnd it doesn't equal show up people liked it reached out to be the other way to win this\nWe have got to be the Democrats not lose to them\nAnd by the way I've had a lot of emails from a lot of uh people who think their expert political analyst and they all well not all but I mean a whole bunch of them have this theory that the way they get the base all fired we want to let them destroy\nA great life for great patriot a great American his whole career his future maybe his family in order to win the midterms how does that work\nYour football team loses\nMake you want to

that we can get NATO to step up and pay more considering we pay over Seventy cents of every dollar for defending NATO or the NATO alliance and nobody thought that our Western European allies that were barking and complaining and having an hauling that Donald Trump wants better trade deals with our partners nobody goes that\nCan happen if you don't say you're going to start at the start of a trade war if you don't say it and act like you mean you're not going to get concessions and the fact is no American president prior to him even dared broach the subject\nAnd meanwhile we see manufacturing jobs leaving states like Michigan Ohio Wisconsin Pennsylvania\nAnd for all the talk and hatred of Donald Trump style the fact that he breaks a lot of dishes to get things done and he says a lot\nAre we better off than we were two years ago are Hispanic Americans better off African Americans women in the workforce better off youth unemployment fourteen states unemployment low unemployment records his own records\nConsumer confidence Wall Street fight every objective discernible measure with doing better\nEnd result shouldn't matter but in thirty six days Democrats are hoping that they've created enough smoke and enough mirrors what did they do in eight years when Obama was president their policies tales on a spectacular level and if I had time I get back into it\nLet me tell you it was never going to be limited in scope this investigation ever it\nWas never going to be you know just a week 'cause so no that's not what they want and when the FBI comes back and all they do is real from\nWhat under penalty of of a felony the four people and the professor Ford case it said either they don't remember or it didn't happen like the case of the one I witnessed she said was in the room when the alleged incident happened\nThey're not going to be happy and they're going to try and stretch out even further and ask for more investigations they're going to find one little nugget that says because the FBI doesn't get recommendations\nThe ... the FBI is is not going to give you know just going to give okay this is what they said\n'cause they don't have any authority in this particular case\nYou know and now we've got to look into all three claims even the ... claim\nYou wouldn't believe thirty six years ago routinely on weekends the boys were drug in girls and and then lining up in the halls waiting to you know raped gang rape these young women because that's what the woman said\nAnd that's what they want to investigate now um it is seemingly having an impact according to the Remington research group forty eight percent in Missouri likely voters planning to vote for the Republican candidate Josh Hawley forty six percent said they plan to vote for McCaskill but\nThen the question of McCaskill's opposition to Kavanaugh whether it's impacting their vote forty nine percent said it made them less likely to vote for McCaskill\nI think Democrats are going to be watching those kind of numbers very closely look their hope is is they they hope they've created enough smoke and fire over Russia still no evidence whatsoever\nThey hope that they create enough smoke and fire here that they can make this all about election day and that you'll forget how awful it was under Obama\nAnd that you won't get up and voted for Trump most people don't go out and midterms mid term elections are about those people that show up motivating your base to get out there\nIf you want Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Chuck Schumer as your majority leader you'll get the government you deserve if you if you wanna tune in on election night in thirty six days\nFive weeks from tomorrow and hear Nancy Pelosi the speaker and Chuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader\nIf by the way Mitch McConnell's railing about\nFord was not told of the chairman's offers that's interesting why did they keep that from her that was an interesting side bar there is I Know that Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham on to investigate Dianne Feinstein now why did she holds us for six weeks would have plenty of time by the way it was six extra weeks to investigate\nWhy did they hold it because they wanted to create this crisis at this time\nBut no there's a lot at stake in in this upcoming election\nNow we did have um the case what what is the woman's name Rachel Mitchell was the one that was asking questions for the Republicans in the Senate\nA professor Ford and she did a very strong analysis of the case you said in the legal context here is my bottom line and he said she said case\nIs incredibly difficult to prove but this cases even weaker than that she said Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either a few that her allegations or failed to corroborate up\nFor the reasons discuss below I Do not think of reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that the evidence is sufficient dissatisfied a preponderance of evidence standard even and\nYou know I that's a pretty powerful statement\nNow we have what else do we have here so we got some other blue state numbers that are really interesting to watch um\nThere's a lot of reasons why in New Jersey this was surprising to me Democratic Sen Robert Menendez is having a tough time getting re elected this is not a state anybody's been paying a lot of attention to\n'em it didn't help him this weekend when they use professor Ford's allegations to bash Brett Kavanaugh and he tweeted out Sunday\nOr Saturday the details of professor Ford's testimony or heart wrenching to hear I Hope every single senator not only watches but listens and two days later the political had a headline shock poll shows a dead heat in Menendez Senate race in New Jersey\nAnd by the way you know think Christie Todd Whitman and\nUm what's ... what's the name of the past Governor Christie Christie himself Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman Christie lotta Christie's in New Jersey um but anyway it was forty five forty three within the margin of error in New Jersey\nGrassley is urging the Justice Department announced prosecute in the case of ah the man who falsely accused Brett Kavanaugh raping an acquaintance after summer Senate Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse helped publicize that bogus allegation\nYou've got in the case of
