B.\nC. today uh see one of the river [noise] that I just put it the bottom of this dog\nIt's about somebody I very rarely comment on because I don't care as phony folk conservative is named Jennifer Rubin\n[noise] uh yeah it is Jennifer Rubin it's amazing transformation this woman has made a Washington Post hired her as a conservative blogger\nDuring the Obama years during the Obama years for the most part she came across as a conservative blogger didn't win Trump got elected she became I think what she's always been just died the cast in the wool liberal\nAnd now she has the the ... do the conservative columnist or blogger at the post but she's not conservative and MSNBC reversed or that way but that's not the point I couldn't tell the story without mentioning her name\nShe says that GOP senators are behaving as if it's their time of the month\nNow\nThat to me it goes a little deeper than what it just sounds like you're on the surface\n\nImagine a conservative saying on MSNBC the female Democrat senators were being so emotional almost hysterical behaving as if\nIt's their time of the month does anybody think that would fly\nThere is no way\nA male commentator anywhere can say that about women senators are women witnesses or any of us aren't but here's Jennifer Ruben\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand sixty and if they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support enable Trump to be successful and she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known results something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand six thing\nAnd that\nIs the capital of circumstance in her mind the conservative populists coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the mid terms with the words in her study of things\nJust continuing to vote for a Party Republicans to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get them out there don't know why\nI Would think it would be but she says it's not Kavanaugh however has provided the catalyst because of how Trump voters that per se and specifically the conservative populace coalition perceive the way he has been treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\nThat the Trump conservative populace coalition is tired and worn out\nThe way they and things they believe in are treated by Democrats the media and Hollywood and her point is that the targets of range\nHad somewhat diminished until cabinet came along and re awaken these people\nAnd fired the backup so she says this is what I see in a nutshell what happened to the Kavanaugh\nHas served as a reminder Anna highlights to the people that voted for Trump why he's successful that it's all about being strong it help remind voters why they supported him\nAnd the other Republican president would have walked away from Kavanaugh by now energy would have been lost but it's not energy as high now that's again that Salinas Ito and her analysis of the electorate today\nHeading into the two thousand sixteen or two thousand easy in midterms now where I Will she knows what she's talking about I find it strange that people who I think the people who voted for Trump are deeply involved with things\nNow maybe there are some exceptions and you have some people to vote for Trump to just set up with Republicans and Democrats and found Trump interesting but for the most part I Am of the opinion that Trump voters did so for a very very very specific reasons related to Trump's agenda which he\nPounded every day multiple times a day Donald Trump told everybody when he was going to do trade deals the wall immigration rebuild the military bring back the economy\nI Would think people have voted for Trump knew that that's what he's going to do and I would also think that people who voted for Trump would realize that he needs more than two years to do it\n\nBut is her insistent know that kind of stuff it evaporates and wanes you know people's lives go on the news changes but to his cabinet circus has re ignited the coalition that elected Trump and this is to the detriment of the Democrats or don't see this happening\n\nShe says the Senate couldn't did see a red wave the house she's not so sure of\nI found it interesting analysis and I I'm One of his share it with you she points out the Democrats are spending money in house races out there like we've never seen before and that Republicans aren't and that leads me to another point that I Need to make but I don't have time right now hang on

would withdraw his nomination ... during that Trump would withdraw\nSo after staring him the embarrassment they miscalculated both ways\nSo now we've had a procedural vote we're gonna have a real

this country\nDamn right that is exactly right I don't think Kavanaugh would be able to sue them I don't think that uh once you start getting into the government government officials and so forth are\nKind of going to you got the first amendment which protects political speech and you can produce an ad that says pretty much anything they can lie about whoever whatever you want and there's not much you can do about it the\nThe uh the remedy for that is more speech\nWhich in this case equals more money to counter the lives that are being told him I saw frustrating thing it drives a lot of

let's\nDo a little hypothetical what's presumed that it's tomorrow at five thirty the votes over and Kavanaugh's confirmed ... asks you a question do you think\nThat the Democrats in the Senate Democrats immediate meaning the media\nDo you think all of these deranged psychologically out of whack protesters are just gonna say well we gave our best shot we'll wait till they nominate somebody else and try to destroy them\nOr do you think that they will continue in their effort to wipe Kavanaugh out and destroy him believe me shoes door number too especially if these clowns when the house\nThey are going to immediately amount to things the impeachment of Trump and therefore impatient Kevin all because if Trump shouldn't have been there and the first place than his nominees shouldn't be either\nThis is not going away there's only one way that it might there was only one way that it might and it's a huge long shot in the business and by All right\nMy all that is just by
