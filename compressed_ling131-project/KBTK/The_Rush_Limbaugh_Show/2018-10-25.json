husband and I were talking last night and we came up with some really good common sense points you make that kind of illustrate why we think these packages weren't actually nail um it it gets their questions and the first one\nTo me is likely is it that some of the male multiple packages to multiple places all over the country and I have in Charlotte miraculously at the same time and across the valley yeah and the thing that possibly the vaccine that that's not that's not common sense I mean I can see how that could\nWork that were just saying that the the Niro package didn't arrive until late yesterday or maybe this morning the or George Soros package arrived the day before true CNN got their Clinton has so far I\nThere was a ... there was a whole group of ... like four or five of them shows up all the same time\nWe're out of you know it was a priority mail\nIt couldn't have been I mean if you looked at the packages anyway obviously your first caller mentioned what I Want the Congress else can they can in fact that there wasn't enough postage on if you had the post office he even accept it um the thing is these these were these were oversized packages\nThat you're not taking them again and paying for them you know it had a number ... hate in profits properly\nUm your you have the post office box right well if you don't even have enough wind whipping oversized into\nThat doesn't make any sense to me and and I know some of the show that the distribution centers that makes sense I I I get I get that that some of them actually did show up at the residents so you're going to think that\nHe got invitations to go to MIT and uh and other schools and really the the device he put together was was not my memory is it was not advanced of all it was\nA it was almost the exact opposite it was almost so basic\nThat everybody was scratching their heads and wondering what was so remarkable about it a Steve I appreciate ... as I say I'll take it out but I have a chance to Jerry in Springfield, Massachusetts or next hello sir\nHi Rochelle radio I'm good\nGood good I just wanted to you know on your point about America giving more than any other nation I think what you were talking about was the government itself but you also get more than any other nation and the point is is that\nI have the choice when I get to charity I give it to\nI don't have the right now my neighbor who they should give it to and that actually what the government telling our\nWho they're going to\nBasically what they got from our tax dollars they don't give a choice and that's my point\nIt's a good point too it's a classic illustration his reacting to the soundbites we play the John Case there was a wringing its hands and guilt\nOver the fact that caravans coming and it's just for the grace of\nGod that we're not in it and that because we're not in it but could be in it except by the grace of God we've got to stop building walls 'cause God doesn't want that\nAnd we've got to realize that that were just playing lucky it's kinda like written Richard Gephardt out winners of lights lottery\nYou know we were just minding our own business one day and we got conceived and a woman in America and we've got born into America and and man that's that's so much luck that that we shouldn't feel weren't anything special or so the fact that we weren't conceived in warms down in Nicaragua in Guatemala means that we all\nWe really do and we gotta we gotta learn to walk in the shoes of others and that's the wrong way to look at it we nobody has any trouble imagining what it's like to be poor\nThat's why so many people strive not to be governor it is it hard to imagine we don't have a lot of people in fact uh most people in this country go up and down in terms of\nAnnual income or people that are in a lot of money and lose if all there are people that are in an average amount of money all their lives and that's it but basically people in this country no poverty\nIf they've never if they've never been in it they certainly don't want to be they know enough to know not to be and that's the great thing about America if you don't want to be there are ways to avoid being in poverty poverty in this country by the way it was a relative thing\nCompared to poverty around the world United States poverty is not really poverty I get in trouble Everytime I point that out but it happens to be true\nUh statistically financially however you want to look at it but but the the way to look at these disparities is not to simply say oh oh that could be me and then the run around feeling guilty about it\nUh\nThe way to deal with this is not to run around constantly imagining well you know if there's one accident and I could have been in that era man and then having that\nImpact the way you deal with it that doesn't help anybody it's not a ... but it does make you look like you have lots of compassion and lots of care but that's a great thing about liberalism it never solves anything\nLiberalism as a\nGutless choice because she had never have to solve anything all you have to do is talk about how much you care\nAnd all you have to do is tell people how much pain you're seeing and how it makes you so uncomfortable to someone here look at the suffering and the starvation and ...\nAnd you are automatically credited as a person with great compassion you haven't solved anything all you've done to say\nThat you recognize and you're telling everybody else they've got to do something about it\nAnd that's liberalism solutions are\nWhere the answer is and solutions to these problems are exactly why they haven't been happening in the United states the past two years\nSolutions\nBy the way before we go to the break I just want to remind all of you again

television\nYou know this is an ... an abject idiot and by the way they're not alone little insinuations by fake news CNN and fake news conspiracy TV at Madison ABC NBC CBS the same thing\nWe've been calling for calm we've been condemning the mobs that have been confronting politicians that was a matter of their left or right where\nAre the ones when a Bernie Sanders supporter tried to assassinate Republican lawmakers on that baseball field nearly killing somebody that is a friend of mine house majority whip Steve sleeves\nI said I'm not blaming Bernie Sanders for this he had nothing to do with\nThat and that's that's but that's the type of logic I even said boy who's the other way around and they say the same they they blame us immediately because they want to put politics Trump's all in their world\nYou know political disagreements et cetera you know they shouldn't be marching orders to follow politicians and cabinet members and create crowds and confront them and tell them they're not wanted any more in a anywhere anymore\nYou know but if you'd call out the deep state if you call out the less hypocrisy you call out their calls for violence the fake news media reporting fake news if you\nDo that that's not inciting violence such just telling the truth and the same goes for people the media\nYou know those those you know Trump supporters of Democrats bashing they've passed me every other day it was weeks that I'm old I'm plastered all over these channels as as wallpaper for crying out loud as they try to use me to get their ratings up\nOut listen I look for all the rhetoric but rhetoric is rhetoric\nYou know what at the end of the day individuals are responsible for their own behavior\nAlthough it does sound like the orders have been sent out to get in people's faces and confront them and tell them that I Want it anywhere anymore that sense does have you know nobody talked about Susan Rice the target of\nA a package of what they've purportedly believed to be rice and that was sent to her home or three weeks ago President Trump General Mattis FBI Director re CIA director Gina Haspel they all got suspicious packages that\nThey were told was racing or done juniors family or going back a few years when it happened to me\nI Know from first hand experience it's a horrible thing to go through it's sadly is threats to me and my family of happened many times over the years more than I Would ever tell you\nI've been saying for months the rhetoric needs to come down someone's gonna get hurt or worse\nOr that I Would ever tell you I've been saying for months the rhetoric needs to come down someone's gonna get hurt or worse\nYou know Kevin McCarthy we've got to Boulder thrown through his office what if somebody was in there and we've been condemning the the unacceptable behavior day after day night after night Democrats have been nowhere to be found they've been silent and they are threats to walk to punch the president fight\nThe president beat up the president blow up the White House et cetera you know severed heads of the president\nHappens and can make a so called comedy shows it happened to the so called news channels it happens in the mainstream media happens everywhere really the New York times perfect time that five novelist imagining Trump's next chapter you know one including murder\nGood grief that says that that's that's maybe a little inappropriate for president I think\nYou know it's an end to watch the calls for civilian it just brings hello to me and I'm not blaming these people they you know they can do what they want this what the Democrats do every two and four years we have some interesting developments in the state of new\nJersey we might have a race and then this is only up by three points people in New Jersey of figured out who Menendez is just like in Minnesota people have figured out who Keith Ellison is he down seven\nIt looks like you know when now finding out of the people have figured out who Bredesen is down in Tennessee and who McCaskill is in Missouri and who's Christine ... is in a you know for sure I don't have a problem of Americans during the Taliban I\nWhy would she get one vote in Arizona after being that crazy\nBut we have a race there in the ... race now with the attorney general the west Virginia Patrick ... bike to over Joe Manchin a lot of people weren't expecting that when you think about it is logical\nAll the success of the west Virginia ... saving coal jobs and energy jobs and all the prosperity is because of Trump's policies and mentioned didn't even support the tax cuts and frankly my guess is the capital vote was just an election year conversion it'll go right back to supporting Chuck Schumer\nAnd Missouri you've got the Daily Caller reporting that Josh Hawley who's running against Claire McCaskill sharing a photo\nOf a yard sign that have been vandalized with a swastika and his name on the sign is this what it's really come down to he asked is now the Missouri attorney general\nClaire McCaskill also caught on tape saying oh I'm just like Obama I'm just I'm just saying these things to get elected um she doesn't care about raining in or or representing the people of Missouri\nYou know you've got another Daily Caller report talks about non exploding bombs turned up yesterday and today the New York times has no reason to seemingly to apologize but they're trumped assassination fantasy that they published the\nDay before the pipe bomb was discovered the first one\nTimes published a story short story about assassinating president Donald Trump on Tuesday one day before potential explosive devices showed up at the addresses of all these political figures New York times are asking novelist to conjure up possible outcomes to Robert Mueller's investigation\nThey don't care of it was only care about Russia collusion as long as it's a Republican only care about sexual misconduct or assault if it's a Republican
