listen to this program is not going to be news to you but as you well know the Democrats in the media have a popular refrain\nThat no matter how the income tax burden is spread around among tax paying members of the public\nAreas and often heard refrain richer not paying their fair share and therefore we need to raise their rates we need to increase the tax percentages their rates and so forth and

just falling into the ocean raising the sea level and you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man you don't know\nExactly and you don't know that it doesn't happen all the time anyway you don't know when it started you don't want to and did you don't know how natural it might be\nBut did you hear her say that the chunks of ice forming into the ocean or raising sea levels I remember one time on this program way way back in the nineties discussing this in fact there are two things\nThe first I pointed out because I have read it and the Heritage Foundation a action report that this was during the spotted owl earth first a natural forest station controversy that was all part of a global warming\nCraze in the early nineties and I pointed out that there were more acreage there was a more acreage of trees are more trees in America then in Nineteen Ninety ... act our founding\nThe left when daddy they said I was insane that couldn't possibly be true that we had come along and we and chopped down trees and we haven't replace them been made things out of the trees and they thought I was just insane I pointed out\nYou people misunderstand something yeah we cut down a lot of trees but you know what we plant for trees this is the word the industry they need what right how do you get what you have to grow trees\nIt's not a finite resource and for every tree that's cut down for new ones are planted it's part of the policy warehouse there is one of the big companies that was doing this they wouldn't they wouldn't listen to it that doesn't compute they couldn't begin to fathom that\nThey couldn't understand anybody seriously claim more trees more forest more forested acreage in Nineteen Ninety two than it was in the Seventeen hundreds\nMake sense to them because they don't understand capitalism or economics everything's in zero sum game if a company came along and dropped out a bunch treat used to build a bunch of houses or whatever and and that's that was trees that were gone forever it's why they don't want your cutting down the redwoods never come back you know\nI'm the same token I remember saying well it's still true today there was another report just last week that there are more tree is forest\nThan acres in America today than there were even fifty years ago the second one was when when I um when I pointed out\nThat are falling ice\nFrom a glacier or light green them is going to raise sea level rise and it's like ice in a glass melting\nI said it's not going to raise the sea levels I said those ice\nCubes being jumped into the ocean and not going to raise ... you're crazy it's crazy it's you know what you're talking about of course it's going to raise ...\nNo it doesn't get a glass eyes and for some water in it Philip Philip Glass in ice put as much as you can and filled up with water I was going to melt you tell me what the glass overflow\nIt will not the volume is the volume a bunch of ice chunks\nFalling off a glacier are in no way capable of raising sea levels it's too massive it's too big what it's all about they thought you know what your throat where you're not a scientist you can see this\n\nTrump is right to say we don't know if it's natural or not but we sure as hell and not the ones causing it if somebody gave you the order okay you need to make ten percent of Greenland melt and have the ice ... what would you do\nTo make that happen to think about what would you\nI have never closes Fifteen hours a week here what is there not say it turns out a lot and the liberal

withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this because they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything but distract\nFrom the mid term elections which are three weeks from tomorrow a away\nAnd so there are some people who are on the left are claiming that she selfish and and trying to haul good what is a lot of light being shined on politics right now because of the because the elections I I think a lot of it is rooted in they have Trump either as many of them do\nAnd they live and breathe\nTo expose

your Thursday or friday show last week you were you were speaking about that movie so I decided to go check it out\nThat would be friday I was ... yes yes\nYes so I got a moment after work I raced over to the theater I I I watched it over there but um [noise] I wanted to I I I just wanted to portray how ... and he was is they were very very powerful movie and to illustrate that I just want to share the experience of what happened after the movie\nI'm normally when you go to a movie theater you watch a movie and then the the credit start rolling in the music playing and you see people they they start getting up and filing out of the theater and they're talking to each other and stuff\nBut this did not happen at the end of the movie guess now after that after the movie was over the the credits began to roll and the music played and and after after a while all all the credits finished and the music stopped and everybody was still seated\nThey're smoking I Need to ask you this because there's one thing about this I'm I'm I made a calculation when\nI was talking about those on friday to not mentioned something about this movie because I I did not want to frighten people or deter them from going to see it oh my God what but but what I'm not asking you to identify that but what if anything surprise\nYou that you didn't know or just just surprised you period even if you think you didn't know what about the movie what did you learn you didn't know\n[noise] well I I didn't know about who Mr guys now was um I ... I was not familiar with the case or anything like that um but that wasn't that wasn't really the the the powerful peace about it but I guess the\nThe\nWhat what made it what made everybody if they were all feeling like me and all sitting down and not moving half of the movie was over [noise] was it was it was about an abortion doctor yes but this this was a movie about a murder trial\nAnd but during the murder trial the um there there were two there were there were two things that were portrayed in one was just the ... of what happens in those clinics but even more than that\nWhat was that the why am I what what was the barbarian eight of what happened in the clinics\nOh the ... of what happens in an abortion clinic when\nNo no in God's nails in God's nails clinic what happened what was the\nOh that uh that he was he was allowing babies to be born and then after they were born Danny would kill him\nExactly that is the vast majority this is why he's called the biggest serial killer in American history God's now killed most of the babies after they were born alive\nAnd he did it by sniffing they're spinal cords with scissors now I didn't save is on friday I didn't say this on\nFriday about gods now about what he did because I didn't want to frightened people away\nIt's not\nAs you I had to struggle to get this out of you so it's not something that jumps out at you when you watch the way he's right\nIt is about primarily a trial I made the point of saying that Nick Searcy who's the director lets the story tell itself there aren't any exaggerating computer generated graphics there there's not a lot of\nA special effect\nA real or computer generated in order to shock because of the story tells itself the numbers\nOf children born alive killed by this man is stunning and shock it then you realize that the mainstream media never even covered the trial much less money had done they've always done their best to suppress it\nIt was nearly impossible to get this movie made precisely because of what yet revealed\n\nHollywood doesn't want this movie made the actors in this movie were risking their future careers by taking roles people like Nick Searcy who um a is a ... and across the board actor he can take the lead they can take a supporting role he can take or\nWhatever you want he chose to direct this movie and all of these people in one way or another we're risking something major by tackling ... and doing it they couldn't find funding people that run the Gulf funding pages would not allow\nAny kind of public funding for the production costs a Facebook Twitter I don't know specifically which one they wouldn't allow any\nWith Facebook would not allow any kind of a a promotion reference or fundraising for this at all is actually kind of a NATO was amazing or miraculous buddy if it was it was a lot of hard work and a lot of time\nTo get this movie made but\nAnd it was a real challenge for them but how how difficult is it\nTo focus on the fact that this abortion as did his murderous work outside the home he did his share of of uh of abortions in the ... the numbers are born alive that this man murdered\nIt's just stunning everybody thinks late term abortion is bad and by the way this kind of abortion\nAnd it's called an abortion if you if it's got a term I'm having a mental block and with the term of this is ... in Illinois and so forth when when the procedure came up with a bill was sponsored to stop this I think it was ... rock Obama who refused to support it\nThe left will not support any limits whatsoever on whatever is called\nAn abortion and\nThe the the the thing that left just tried to do encountering this movie is to say well well\nOne more God's know then you go hunting overturn roe versus Wade they tried to say God's now was doing what he was doing because women had no other choice they couldn't go anywhere to get\nThat's a flat out why by the way guys know clinic if you will none of the none of the gear was sterilized people that were getting sick and infected with it just it was a big stars in Philadelphia\nBut I did lose focus on that on purpose because I didn't want to see because\nYou don't see it that's my point they don't graphically try to make their point they focus on a murder trial but good going\nOut there John I'm sure he was he was getting sweating of nervous out there
