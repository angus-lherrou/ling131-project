I'll get right to the point I have one comment one question and comment is it going around this talking point that uh you know since his cabinet victory that the president is teaching the Republicans how to fight I actually think he's teaching the Democrats what it's like a loose\nAnd I don't think anybody's pick it up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like there used to the Republican just given it\nAnd and the question I had was what do you think would happen\nIt because I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media it instead of a blue wave if there was a red I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what was the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival\nUh and safety\nBecause I think if the Democrats do not win the house that if you listen to scuttle but sounds like he's preparing for the Republicans to hold the Senate maybe even expand it or hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house\nIn numbers we haven't seen and who knows how like since Nineteen Ninety four and I've been wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ...\nMedia and and and pulling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixteen got even close to being right Rasmussen was one about away Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval numbers metropolis forty\nOne or the ... the\nPolling David the drive by trust shows them jobs even now after the Capitol hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back\n\nThe Republican I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it a\nBuck the Republican governor California is is closer than is running if gambling notion that anybody would ever have believed possible if the Democrats do not retake the house\nThis guy's a reprimand on the first order and you\nKnow officer you know our\nGovernment is separating the two parents that are born or at them\nAnd the cops we bought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch and say well that's it for the show the level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there are people ought to be more educated more informants smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learn and people with Avon so load block the idiots\n\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nTrump in fact wrote an executive order to end it\nWhich was beaten back on the basis that it was unconstitutional lift the statute in America today says families will be separated\nAnd it's to protect the kids the reason for the reason for the separation is the parents are shoveled off in the holding cells while their cases are adjudicated\nSo I'm watching this stupid show and I see a guy who any under normal season will be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement converted into a quasar zero because he is rounding up kids that Trump is separating from their parents in saving\nUs so I went to the DVR and I cancel law and order and you're SUV I get rid of that ... been out there long enough twenty some odd years anyway so and they're all dropping like flies they all feature stuff like this and\n\nSo you really you think that two hundred\nNine Republican House seats coming up for grabs be cause people all over this country are fed up with Trump and the Republicans separating families [noise]\n\nWell uh\nBut that wasn't explained to hundred night services it's a lot of Republican tournaments what yeah committee chairman are retiring because their term limited\n\nForty three members are retiring some of them are committed German and the reason they're quitting is because they don't want to go back to being average ordinary members when you're a committee chairman you got perks you gotta tend to get t._v. time\nYou know you matter but when your term limited out of your chairmanship when you quit and you're part of your time they're into big box in the private sector\nYou know there are some Republican retirements but there are two hundred nine of them\nBut my my only point is for there to be this kind of blue wave forty four forty seven of retirements does not explain it not with the Democrats think they've got two hundred nine seats leaning in their favor\n\nOr you don't think it's policy well there were people if this is all true there has to be something or a series of things\nThat the American public is just ... to be tied over and want to take it all out of Republicans as again the media to Democrats will tell you it's Trump the people in this country have Trump they're embarrassed of Trump but that's what they think\n\nThe evidence that the country hates Trump to it isn't there in any even even if you look at the leftist opinion polls at forty one percent approval that's not in the twenties where George W.

couldn't quite do it you see it on the clock photographed the eyes getting tighter and tighter and tighter and that means that this storm is intensifying as it comes to the coast is look\nThere's nothing magical about it and I we I wrote\nI wrote down this weekend and I I Know that sounds pompous but you've got people say we've never seen anything like this it's already started with the climate ambulance chasing\nThis has been telegraph so far in advance and even from late last week you could see that was going to be a major problem coming up into the Gulf of Mexico and if it was going to be what we call rapid rapid developments\nEvery now and then and we're fortunate with uh Florence said it was you know it was ... this is going the opposite way and that's what hurricanes do and given the ideal situation that is what is it so\nIt really hits landfall I Would say if I'm looking at my own your website actually so you have a hitting land it's really going to start getting rough about noon tomorrow we'll a little before\nRight at that and then the the landfall I think at some time between three and nine PM it Panama City will get that down and they I Believe maybe on with the on TV Tonight we will be honing in on this we got a lot of people in that area of course you know as you've been harping about what twenty eight days away\nAnd we all we want to know people

storm\nAlright Joe ... started the official weathermen of the Sean Hannity show please you know whatever your local officials tell you I'm what I'm hearing from Joe is if you're a coastal person you're going to want to move inland probably a little bit more\nUh westward rather than eastward because it's going to make a right turn it looks like it's headed right through the Atlanta area\nRight into the coastal areas of the Carolinas and uh and then straight out to see maybe getting his upward as northern as a Virginia but look at whatever your local officials tell you if they tell you got to evacuate don't be pride full just suck it up take the day or to\nMake sure you're safe and secure put put that as a top priority\nAh All right thanks so much for being with us Joe ... weather bell dot com thank you uh eight hundred million for one show and if you want to be a part of the program president now even he's saying what I'm suggesting is that is that the U.S would end up ah like Venezuela if if the Democrats win the midterms there's some truth to that\nThere's a little bit of payback I see for Senator Lisa Murkowski geo peel Alaska\nApparently is going to either reprimand or totally disappeared now Lisa Murkowski I Would assume a primary side of the one person I'd love in Alaska to run against or would be\nSarah pale and maybe Governor Palin could make a a political comeback I think the people there would like like that a lot um\nThere was a guy out this was a fascinating race cars you wouldn't think anything in California would be in play although there are very important especially in Southern California\nThere are very important congressional seats in play and that would be from say just south of Los Angeles Orange County down and through San Diego and I know they've had massive population shifts down there but you wouldn't think state wide that you'd have\nA gubernatorial race that is now is closed as it is\nIt's a five point race between Gavin Newsom and the Republican businessman guy by the name of John cops\nWe've got to get John Cox on the program and I'm going to tell you why it's happening\nBecause the people in California are fundamentally understanding what Gavin Newsom is proposing is an economic disaster for that state\nWent oh free health care for everybody it doesn't matter if you're in California legally or not and also the cost of it being not only a sanctuary city like San Francisco but a sanctuary state\nWell that means that that includes health care that's the criminal justice system that the educational system\nAnd if people not paying taxes are in this state illegally and maybe some illegal immigrants do but they're certainly available to use services under what Gavin Newsom is proposing for everybody\nIt's basically putting a sign out that would say hey free health care in California just make it here and we'll take care of you\nAnd you know people are going to do they're going to make it there and use the California health system and remember California already has a state income tax uh Thirteen and a half percent\nYou know add that to a federal income tax and the fact that you can no longer the duck after the tax cut plan passed you could no longer caught\nOr deduct rather your state income taxes on your tax return means that if you do make money in California you're paying that much more in taxes so the people of California are hit harder than any other state in the United states and New York is where I Am is right behind them\nJust ridiculous the amount of the burdens that they're putting on the people of California and Dianne Feinstein is up for reelection it's gonna be interesting to see if ah Gavin Newsom will pull her down in terms of the polls but anyway we'll we'll have to watch that race a little more closely and see what happens all the way we do have\nAn attempt by the ... Democrats are now threatening to impeach and continue the investigations into judge Kavanaugh\nAnd um they want to now begin the process of teaching them to the house Judiciary Committee Jerrold Nadler who's a strongly implied impeachment would be on the table of Democrats take over the lower chamber in the midterms\nIs there anybody in the Democratic party that's running on any agenda item that would make\nMake America great for the people in the country or they offering anything to make for better America for anybody Morgan\nStanley said the belief in American exceptionalism among global investors has never been higher\nMorgan Stanley guy by the name of Mr ... Sharma was on CNBC said this year has been the story about how well America has done all any of the example of an American exceptionalism\nQuote we may or may not believe in American exceptionalism but at the financial markets have never believed in it to such an extent and then he went on to add as the head of emerging markets and the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley investment management\nIs global from is four hundred and Seventy four billion in assets under management as of June thirtieth twenty Eighteen\nThe strong accountant economy has been touted by people like Larry Kudlow called it the hottest economy in the world but there's no doubt it's for the proof is in the pudding\nUm\nKnow it was an interesting piece by my buddy Hugh Hewitt Trump may be outside of our norms but he is the seating for all of us\nThat I just read a little bit of the article I didn't finish it yet but I think what he's saying there's a point that I've been making as well except in a different way and that is that if you look at any criticism of Donald Trump it's all stylistic stuff", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "09"}
