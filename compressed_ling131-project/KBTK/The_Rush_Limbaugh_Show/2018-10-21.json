Elizabeth Warren is all three networks mock Native American claimed this is the last thing that she expected it happened the news media cannot carry her water\nHer excuses to flimsy what's really interesting about this is the news media has known all along that this is a bogus claiming they were more than willing to carry it they were more than willing to promote it propagated\nDo whatever

yeah blue wave Democrat's gonna win big gets it's our time people are fed up but that's not how she found\nSee how many days in a long time in politics [laughter]\nI'm not breaking out the champagne and I'm not trying to scramble my eggs before I get my chickens right\nWe still have to improve turnout turnout turnout turnout\nDemocratic victory depends on turnout among millennials want on the phone millennials voted in the last midterm we also got to make sure that we get a paint way before we can get a blue tie we need these women to when they're wearing says I'm confident not over confident\nYou asked me today well but I Do differently in terms of Democrats would target Latinos I Would talk to millennials\nOkay so why would she do differently she's saying here that Democrats are dropping the ball with Latinos why is she saying that well because she has the freedom to say she's not at the moment in the in the hierarchy of the apparatus and it\nTurns out that Latinos are far more supportive of Trump at Republicans and anybody know according to recent polling data that Democrats are done at the number of Latino those that are signing on with Republicans and Trump the reason there's long just because they believe that all Latino is\nShould despise anybody who is anti\nIllegal immigration or wants to build a wall the millennial thing I think\nThat's about as voter turnout and she mentions of here everybody talks about the millennials and young people and young people that\nIt just it never ceases to be the case that election day they don't show up they don't show up in the numbers everybody thinks they're going to show up in and every cycle\nThis plays out every cycle we're told the youth vote is fired up this time Mr Limbaugh the youth vote their energetic they're energized they are motivated this is a new\nDay they can't wait and then same old thing happens they don't show up in the numbers that everybody expects them to she is suggesting that that may be the case here the Democrats and failed to light a fire under the Latino thing bother to them and what the Latino thing that actually stands for is immigration\nShe is I I'm I guarantee you like many other Democrats are stunned that immigration remains such a big positive winning issue for Trump and the Republicans and it\nIs it is the issue every Republican running for office eater incumbents or running for the first time needs to be focusing on this issue there is no way it\nCan hurt them\nOut I met him they have to be on the right side about it\nFirst time needs

back just to make it past NBC News [noise]\nUncertainty over a blue wave NBC News fine Democrat and GOP voter registrations at the same level as past election cycles\nA but but but but but but but but but\nThe Democrats have Michelle my bell out there during the whole big voter registration drive out there\nThe Democrats have been registering voters in prison even registering voters at the DMV they've been registering voters at the at the at the at the medical marijuana places they've been registering voters everywhere how in the world is it possible\nThat democratic voter registration levels at the same as pest cycles the Democrats have been telling us that there's so much energy\nThere is so much excitement there's so much motivation there so much just ... nothing can hold them back and yet and yet\nThe generic ballot once again is showing that this massive Democrat blue wave is not as big as once thought\nNow NBC is is is very very worried they're worried that something that's not a blue wave may be shaping up here\nThat's what this headline is that in certain they over a blue wave NBC News finds Democrat GOP\nVoter registration at the same level as past cycles comparing registration activity for twenty four team to twenty sixteen but activity for twenty sixty inch current\nHelps put these numbers in that context but it should be noted that twenty fourteen and twenty six didn't include a complete picture of registration from those years\nWhereas twenty Eighteen only includes registration activity up until this point in time what what that's all you need to get up you're not registered yet the odds are you're not going to be registered in time to vote so it\nThat seems like a little hope will we don't have a pool databases numbers for two thousand I said well you got enough to know\nSo how can this be helping voter registration if Democrats are supposed to be smoking us in voter registration 'cause there's so much more interest there so much hatred for Trump\nThere's so many people that want to fix that mistake then they call 'em from the Washington Post\nBy Megan McCarthy dull\nTrying to help the Democrats who she believes are morally superior and smarter than Republicans headline will the blue wave collapse before it reaches the shore what Megan McCarthy all in this op ed in the Washington Post is doing is trying to help Democrats\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein or whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see it go ahead and they release it\nAnd there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction me because folks didn't want to read the sixteen never Trump anti Trump hate mongers on Mueller's team if they had the gods yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to get one T a blue wave\nIf mother doesn't have any of that than there is no way they want this released before the midterms that's why\nThey're linking ... ready they're going to try to take advantage of what they can make\nPeople think the report says I remember they have two years no more than that and a two and a half years of Danny reporting that Trump and Russia colluded\nSo in their minds they're probably thinking a sizable number of American voters believe the Trump Russia collusion happens\nSo Mueller's report is ready to be released soon or create the impression that it's only a matter of time no before Trump is tied to the Russians were collusion and use that way to impact\nVoting in turn out prior to the midterms I'm just going to tell you if this report doesn't advance this narrative that Trump cheated and stole the election they're not going to want this up before the midterms\nYou're mansions I'll let down that's what you don't know you don't know how many\nOf your base common ordinary everyday democratic voters literally believe that Trump won this election by cheating with Russia you'd be done at\nThe number of your fellow Democrats citizens in New York and\nLos Angeles and San Francisco in Chicago who believe it light gospel\nDespite all realm of common sense despite every\nBit of knowledge we have that there is no evidence for just like how many of them believe ball the Ford\nTheir politics requires that they believe\nIt's mandates they believe that if they are told before them in terms that the smaller report doesn't\nHave this evidence and will not leave the President Trump being indicted on that basis what does that do to turn out\n\nNow don't misunderstand I think Mueller's report whenever it is released is going to really be targeted at Trump\nAs an incompetent as a boob who are in get injured the United states electoral system\nWith his hires and with some of the people on the staff white Carter Page I think they're going to fire both barrels at Trump as an incompetent who nearly brought the world to nuclear Armageddon\nBecause of his incompetence stupidity\nBut I don't think there's going to be any evidence of it\nAnd the fact that there is no evidence is what tells me they don't want this out before the midterms I could be wrong only have to wait and see it won't be long either way\nWhat needs to be said Russia ... worth\nMy friends I enjoy things
