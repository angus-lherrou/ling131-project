the the stress or that's the problem it's helping people to manage their own ability to deal with stress\nBecause they could they could have problems with any issue money or relationships or something else it's really helping to get stronger to eat\nOr to build some palaces and to not catch them so Chris soon to be a little more open minded\nUm said I'm not seeing with with some of those people are

spend now traveling the country you know I Love the fact that you know probably political people around the president is telling him\nWell you may not want to get involved in the Republican glue they're gonna blame you blah blah blah\nThat that's just not how he rose to ... if we if you fight hard and you give something you're all and you don't win at least you can look in the mirror and say you did everything you could do but there's there's a lot at stake\nWhy is it that when you look at the number of democratic leaders you know those out there like Maxine Waters speaking or her and others you know all of this mob violence that we have seen they didn't look at ...\nAnd then you look at record low unemployment and fourteen states record low unemployment for Hispanic Americans African Americans are Asian Americans um women in the workforce used unemployment totally all record lows\nAnd somebody goes in and talks about prison reform bringing jobs back to America building factories manufacturing centers in America making America great again and helping those people that that want their shot at the American dream and then talking about eliminating crime and some big cities like Chicago\nAnyone that dares to try and work on a solution with Donald Trump and craft some real solutions is just on mercifully vilified\nAnd that's what they did the economy or yesterday and you know I I'm just sitting there saying wow and I'm ... it's not new to me they've done it to a lot of our friends on this program Niger enters the named Bruce Braley she'd but she writes about

innocence no constitutional authority you know\nHillary cheat to win a primary tries to cheat to win a general election\nThey literally use her bought and paid for Russian lives as a means of lying to by the courts to spy on an opposition party candidate in campaign before the elections still doesn't work\nThen they use it with no evidence that disseminating information as a means of starting a pony Russia investigation to put the country into chaos for the last Eighteen months that still hasn't gone away completely\nApparently according to news I guess the special counsel's office is now finally agreed to written answers\n... you know took to ridiculous questions because we now know so much about the media elite strategy the insurance policy\nAnd the fact that if this dot CA

on the world stage nobody doubts the interference Devon Nunez he warned everybody in twenty fourteen it was coming in twenty sixteen thank God it didn't impact any votes according to all the studies\nBut literally there was a backlash in a in a silent coup attempt by just a small select people in power that happened to be at the FBI and the department of justice\nWe still haven't gotten to the bottom of that because the media tries to ignore that story as much as possible\nSo unbelievable what we've lived through and then so the Mueller investigation will come to an end then you'll
