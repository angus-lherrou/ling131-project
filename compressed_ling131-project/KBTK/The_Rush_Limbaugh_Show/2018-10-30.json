thank you for all you do you ...

Hollywood and I think it has been engaging in gas lighting or the right what\nWould you what would you define that I hear so many people use that word [noise] okay would you tell me how your impending it to be defined\nOkay gas lighting I'm the most common example is when I'm In a family they cripple usually been nice this child in the family to take care of all of that it can burn and what they do is say ridicule that person they talk about them they sneer at then and especially when people aren't looking\nAnd then if that person dares to get angry oh look look look at look at how bad you are and then they tell everyone they know how bad this person is and they make up its entire narrative and what they believe rush it that that person is an idiot they're not evil now I'm not saying all that every I'm liberal person\nSpent numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and when everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media is right in their facilitating them I'm telling you is isn't it used to work like a charm and on many people still does\nWe still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding\nBy virtue of whether the media as being nice to 'em or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there but the\nElectoral results just in the past two years indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that uh to see what [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris ... I got I got you know I'm On Fox News Sunday\nTwice a year during ratings month and\nChris Wallace was always\nVery polite and exceedingly nice and asks me to make sure that tell you not to get mad at him for interrupting me because he doesn't he would never get a question and after ... the first one\nSo I got a note from a golf buddy who watched this past Sunday man this guy wall as you say he's a good guy but this guy's gone so far left I don't know if I I I don't know if I couldn't believe what you're told me about him anymore\nSo I said well what happened\nWell it clearly wasn't this on Fox News Sunday Chris Wallace contrast in front page headlines from a Washington Post the day after Steve ... was shot in Alexandria, Virginia\nBy Bernie Sanders supporters with the Washington Post headline following the capture of the mail bomb mastermind\nAnd Trump supporters genius or say Huck and not surprisingly the post made sure to emphasize that say ox political views were mentioned in the headline while a guy that shot up skull east was not mentioned\nPolitically at all\nAnd it's Chris Wallace holding these two headlines up and pointing it out the say oc headline read bombs suspect outspoken supporter of Trump Wallace said that the headline really surprised him he expected the Washington Post headline to read something light suspect arrested\nA closer inspection of a article finds that it does not even mentioned the ... was the bombing suspect and some of the fourth paragraph instead the first three paragraphs read like a psychological profile of the guy talking about his support for Trump and all those stickers on his van\nBut on the other hand the headline after the ... shootings sadly congressman shot in Virginia you didn't mention his name it didn't mention his support for Bernie Sanders and the front page article did not mention um anything infected foot noted\nHis support for Sanders and it barely\nLike one of the asterisk mentioning that the guy was highly critical of President Trump so here's Chris Wallace holding up the I. V. if evidence of media bias here that he said\nSurprised him\nAnd later on in the in the show Jason Riley and the wall Street Journal was on he said if you want to know why Trump won't give up Twitter and if you want to know why Trump won't give up social media this is why these two headlines or why\n... right you folks it every day Donald Trump is the only Republican tweeting\nOr informing people about the success of his policies everyday stock market good Trump tweets everyday consumer confidence up Trump's tweets it every day what ever the economic news is or whatever the successes that his agenda his administration is having he tweets\nAnd if it weren't for him it wouldn't be out there other than us of course here or in so called alternative media but but but the point is the Republican Party\nIs not even touting the Trump administration's agenda successes Trump alone is doing it\nAnd that's why he's not going to give up the opportunity to do it in and I hope we never does\nBut when I when I realized this that Trump is the only guy like today there are a couple of tweets Trump tweeting the a consumer confidence\nAs being at a record high and and relating to how can people be voting Democrat when this time of great economic news has been the the news of the day for two years\nThere's all kinds of Republicans are running for election and four hundred and thirty five house seats thirty five thirty six Senate seats where is I don't ...

I get myself in the other over something and I'll I'll stop and remind myself ... unbelievably fortunate I Am an blessed\nBut the tendency is to be overwhelmed with the things that are disappointing or depressing or angering\nAnd\nFor that reason it's easy to get caught up in all of the the negative is a ... and we are no doubt in the midst of a serious serious challenge for our country but it shouldn't\nOr neck gate the\nReal truth that we still live in America and we still have the greatest opportunity if we want to try to make the most of it and capitalize on yeah the obstacles may be bigger and there may be more of them but it's still possible because people are doing it every day\nAnd I think the\nElection needs to be looked at in a with a combination of these ways it's a positive opportunity to continue on the corrective path that we're on\nAnd it it ... it's just better way to live but it takes application of do it when you're bombarded constantly\nWith negative things that I must you know we all are guilty of doing that in a sense because we all want to sound appropriate warnings but important to keep things in perspective at the same I've got to take a break I should develop this even more\nOn the merits rush ... be four Ninety seven point one to be talking on air and online at\nWhen you put a safe and you're home what will you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one brand of safe you should trust to put in your home and that's right oh saves\nAnd Trump is considering an executive order to end the citizenship policy it's based on the fourteenth amendment to the constitution the president arguing it helps fuel illegal immigration including some of the migrants heading up from Central America now\nThere but a lot of meetings here at the White House over the last week about this caravan and how to address it one of the ideas it's being kicked around is this idea of ending birthright citizenship so that anybody who came into the country illegally\nAnd had a baby here would not be able to claim American citizenship for the baby this was a big issue you remember in the twenties sixteen campaign the president talking about so called quote anchor baby boxes\nJohn Roberts House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi says the president doesn't have the power to erase parts of the constitution she says the proposal shows Republicans spiraling desperation to distract from other issues including healthcare a week before the midterm elections\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham says he'll propose legislation to change the birthright policy\nThe president and first lady meantime do later this hour in Pittsburgh as a steady stream of mourners pays respects\nWe're eleven people were killed six injured on Saturday the tree of life synagogue\nFor victims of the shooting were laid to rest today they are the brothers diesel and David Rosenthal Dr Jerry Rubin a witch and Daniel Stern there will be\nOlder funerals throughout the week there's a plaque or in the makeshift memorial it is something that everyone today can agree on it reads hate and violence or not the answer\nBoxes David Lee Miller in Pittsburgh and our the clothes on Wall street or rallies picking up steam right now the Dow is up two hundred sixty eight points now topping twenty four thousand seven hundred\n...

Republican Senate landslide in twenty fourteen is what Nate Silver five thirty eight said this year's Senate election is closed for Republicans have the clear a path to a majority but it is a treacherous one\nRepublicans are favored in Iowa Colorado for example but not by much if Democrats eked out victories in those states and picked up the seat in Kansas they can control fifty seats and keep their majority Democrats but also pick up seats from the jail paying Georgia Kentucky Republican gains in Arkansas Louisiana or probable but\nFar from certain relatively modest errors in the right states would do tricks for the Democrats anyway that Republicans picked up nine\nDonald Trump didn't want a single state according to the polls\nJohn Kerry was going to be president because of the polls now I don't have a crystal ball\nAnd I just know when we're in the fight and I just you know I have a natural gut instinct to always wanna play like I'm behind play hard and the way you play hard in this case is you make a decision now\nRose tenant friend of this program she was home with those yesterday you know she exposed this is their hateful garbage a broad that it is and saying those comments come from you know some fringe group but not from that not representative of anybody the mainstream of the Pittsburgh Jewish community\nThe Jerusalem Post today points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever they're not it's not mainstream it's a political group and they would want to give them any attention\nAnd then anyway anyway so they invited a I guess and interviewed rabbi Jeffrey Myers he gave a prayer yesterday that was beyond beautiful\nI mean how pastors and priests and you know people the cloth are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just dying inside I don't know\nIt takes a very special anointed person to be that kind of person Donald Trump's my president the president of the United states is always welcome to visit\nYou know my friend David shown on this program has been to the tree of life says rabbi Myers is an amazing man\nAnd um why wouldn't you want the president to come and comfort your congregation there's never been a more pro Israel president in my lifetime than this one\nIt's just it's just the fact all the president's promise that Jerusalem which is the rightful capital of Israel oh gotta move it from Tel Aviv Israel and they never do it because they never have the courage to do it\nWhat a Donald Trump is getting all these calls from other countries in the ... region they said no I'm doing it I made a promise I'm keeping my word\nOh why don't we have a little bit more of that\nThat is one thing that Donald Trump if he gives his word is going to he's fighting for it we see it now happening on the immigration fight or the president and a Lindsey Graham of teamed up to and birthright citizenship other words if you enter the country illegally and you happen to give birth to a child a child's instantly\nThough you're in the country illegally interest in it initially is just automatically a U.S citizen doesn't matter that your parents are here illegally well that is only to encouraging other illegal behavior we're asking people we support immigration legal immigration\nWe now see caravan organizers loading ... illegal migrants on the buses headed for the U.S although some of the people now have been turning back\nUm the Pentagon now is deployed over fifty two hundred troops they're putting up barriers ... barbed wire and other things because we can't have what happened on\nThe southern border with Guatemala Mexico Mexico southern border where people just rush across and rush over the police you know we had apparently a confrontation yesterday one dead dozens injured as a caravan was clashing with Mexican authorities we don't want that here\nWe are saying if you want to come then come legally don't come illegally respect America First thing to getting into America has to be respect America the sovereignty respect our borders respect to America is\nUm\nThis is getting interesting about Robert ... I don't really know what to think about it I'm a little torn about even talking about it but\nApparently Mike Allen let's see if I can pull this story up here is a tweeting out that special counsel former FBI Director Mueller is accused of\nSome type of sexual impropriety\nAgainst women and the FBI now is looking into it that it's a false stories so I Want to give you both sides of it daily news has a a very different take on it and they're headline is FBI asked to investigate allegations that women were offered cash to accuse Robert Mueller\nOf sexual assault\nI Know for a fact that a tape exists or where there is a very prominent person\nOn the tape on about Mueller very prominent person on the tape offering money to somebody to make allegations against Donald Trump why this tape has never been made public I don't know\nBut it does exist and I'm not going to go any further than that at this point so this type of thing does happen\nAnd I think like with every other case I mean I'm not a fan of the team that Robert Mueller put together I you know I'm always torn because I never want to credit I'm I'm very fond of law enforcement\nI just hate the people that he hired in this witch hunt how we ever got off into things like you know bank loan applications when it was supposed to be about Trump Russia collusion you know we're at a point in history where this is how phony Democrats are they only care about Russia collusion and interference if it's Donald Trump\nBut when you have real evidence 'cause there's no evidence of Trump Russia collusion when there's real evidence of Hillary paying for a pony Russian dot CA disseminated by top intelligence officials\nAnd FBI officials to lie to the American people before an election is used to commit fraud on Pfizer
