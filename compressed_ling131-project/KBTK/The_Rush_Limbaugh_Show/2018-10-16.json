saying um\nOh listen listen because people can't know but of course Claire andme Obama they have the same views on everything\nWhat agenda they proposing that you like what what what are they offering you the Democratic party that you find the tractors because we have news out today that we can add to the four hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs that weren't\nComing back to Fort plus million new jobs that have been created in less than two years the eight million out of food stamps and poverty the past recovery we've seen that's GDP Growth in in such a long time when there's a new one today consumer confidence at an all time high\nNumber job openings in the U.S rose slightly oh in a record low unemployment three point seven percent record low on that I mentioned record low unemployment and fourteen states that I mentioned since Trump's been elected record low unemployment for\nFor Hispanic Americans African Americans Asian Americans vets women in the workplace youth unemployment\nThat I mentioned in any of that because the media is not mentioning it they just want to hate Trump every day that I mentioned that\nOh the marketwatch printed today that the number of job openings in the U.S rose to a record seven point one for a million in August reflecting strong growth in the economy and the best labor market in decades that would be CBS is marketwatch not Hannity's marketwatch\nJob openings topping seven million for the first time ever in July and bigger show they increased again in August we have two records in a row of us job opening or job openings\nMean that means that you might be able to finally change jobs and get on the career path you've been dreaming about with the eight years of democratic failure know what that means that may be a change jobs and get paid that much more per hour or year that just\nPuts you in a whole new economic category for yourself your family your lifestyle the house you can live in a car you can buy the made the dinners you might be able to afford to go to\nThe the trips that there's any that you want to take your kids on you've been dreaming about that's what that means or the new job maybe means another job just part time that you can bring in a little extra cash for the family because you need it\nYou know jobs this the seven plus million jobs waiting to be filled marketwatch goes on me while easily exceeding the number of people officially classified as unemployed we have a million more jobs available then we have people on unemployment in this country\nJob openings top the number of unemployed unemployed for the first time in march of this year based on government records going back to two thousand that gap is now ... widened to ... to a record nine hundred thousand\nWe have nine hundred thousand more jobs and we have people on unemployment\nSome five point seven eight million people were hired last month\nBy point seven one people million people lost or left their jobs including three point six million who quit the share of people left jobs in their own known as the quit rate was an change that a Seventeen year high you know why it's high\nIt's people are moving on to better jobs that pay more that offer a\nBetter opportunity better benefits better career path better career ... for short trajectory\nThat it's a Seventeen year high ... to point seven among private sector employees up from one point five percent of the end of the great recession two thousand and not the end of the great recession\nAnd it was so bad Lindsey Graham said this morning one of the angry democratic mobs and I'll tell you right now we don't start cleaning the halls of Congress people protesters you're just going to have to do it\nBecause one of these politicians is going to end up getting hurt or worse as these confrontations and in some cases paid mobs rent 'em up you know people that get paid to go out there and just confront the senators the congressmen the way they do\nIn any way that some some angry democratic my quote spit on him while they were protesting Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation two weeks ago\nI don't get it's spending on someone who is it a salty\nSpit on somebody let alone a U.S senator you deserve to be arrested why is it not happening\nI look I but I I Will tell anybody and I trained mixed martial arts five days a week and I'll take my advice I give it to my kids all the time walk away that's right you you know you only do one of the things I've learned more than\nAnything and I've I've been training hard I'd do it in an hour and a half a day now five days a week\nI'm not a black belt yet but I'm On my way I'm a brown second degree it's sort of collective blend up tempo jujitsu a crop ... guy and I'm boxing and street fighting we do firearm blades stick training we do it all\nYou know what I'm going to do somebody says something horrible to me I Want to walk away they spit on me I'm going to walk away if they put their hands on me I warned them as much as I can and try and get away\nBut you see the environment you see the tapes\nAnd just going to tell you it's a very dangerous somebody's going to get hurt I don't want anybody to get hurt\nI don't care what your politics are keep your hands to yourself that's my advice\nNow here is an interesting Washington Post ABC News poll Republicans now a head and the key battleground house districts now this is the most important part of the poll if you look at it they quote ABC News is recline\nDistricts now this is the most important part of the poll\nIf you look at it they quote ABC News is recline took a look at the current generic ballot polling which favors the Democrats but\nYou know what it always favors the Democrats although we have other polls that have shown that that that gap has narrowed significantly what he's pointing out is the core concerns now with three weeks to go three weeks from tonight you're going to get the results\nIs that Democrats worry a whole lot that mid term enthusiasm is going to wind up wasted in places they don't need it\nIn other words but they're really finding is let me translate that oh they have the generic ballot wrapped up in New York Chicago\nNew Jersey Trenton you know San Francisco everywhere in between they have a wrapped up in Los Angeles probably but not in red state America\nAnd what this analysis shows is inside the districts that will result in the the balance of power in the house of representatives put it another way that will decide if Nancy Pelosi once again gets the gamble and become speaker\nIt is a dead heat\nForty six forty seven Democrats versus Republicans very similar dynamic driven by democratic strength and cities their weaknesses in rural areas that is driving house and Senate forecast in opposite directions in other words the Senate is looking good\nMarsha Blackburn after the tape my project that she's doing better by fourteen hours up by seven that's such an important race in Nevada Christian cinemas\nImploding and Arizona latest revelation no she's inviting you know the blind shakes attorney was under federal investigation at the time to speak at Arizona State and of course the people Arizona are crazy and if the meth capital of the world might have a little something to do with borders just just saying Christian\nAnd inviting which is to this bizarre whatever she had I mean I I was in the Washington Examiner yesterday\nAnd he was going up against Martha ... through war hero good luck with that race at this point\nSame thing with ... you know Heidi Heitkamp was the only way these Democrats can win as to why do you not talk about what they really want to do\nNew York times is now concerned that Democrats could be in for disappointment on November ... column their headlined what could ruin a big blue wave two prominent New York Times columnist some of the problem with these words quote Donald Trump seems to have faded Hispanics voter wrath\nWhatever what does that mean anyway you mean the fact that we have the lowest level of unemployment for Hispanic Americans that African Americans and women in the workforce look I I get that some people don't like Donald Trump style\nBut you can't argue with the results and you can't argue with the fact that he made promises and he's kept the kind of refreshing\nAnyway goes on to point out Hispanic voters despite all of Trump's Porter cruel these\nWell he's always talked about some people that can make crimes and I've been down to the border more than anybody in the New York times\nAnd I've seen it myself maybe they should go to the drug warehouses should ride horseback all terrain vehicles and helicopters boats\nLike I haven't stand by the border walls and and you know look at the tunnels that have been built and look at the drug trafficking in the human trafficking that has occurred and maybe sit through security briefing and the Rio Grande in the Texas border like
