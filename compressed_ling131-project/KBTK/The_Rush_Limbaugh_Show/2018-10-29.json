why do you think so much attention is being lavish on of the people you referred to as the illegals coming here who are not citizens but just being a granted access to so many things given so much why do you think it's happening\nA will there's a lot of reasons for one thing Obama made it all just come hallway and you know um but I think it's just because they think they see what we're going to go there and nobody's gonna stop us you know well maybe the military is going to stop this\nTitle no I understand why there ... why do you think there is so much a tolerance for it why do you think so many people are wandering them here and and and want to do nothing to stop them from from getting him why do you think there's so much tolerance for the illegal well aspect of this\nI don't well a lot of the people who are voting they don't know anything about why\n[noise] I don't know where to stop why would they ah I don't know why the people are wanting to give away their money to them by I think that they're saying oh well poor people you know there are countries that war stricken\nWell you know America has to help there are people too they can't just give away money to these illegals coming and they're like well that they may bring jobs here\nHow are they bringing jobs here when they're going to go work at I mean they're going to go work in agriculture agriculture or something 'cause I Know there's a lot of illegals\nHow are they bringing jobs here when they're going to go work at I mean they're going to go work in agriculture agriculture or something 'cause I Know there's a lot of illegals outlet in California and there's a lot around new island but\nI don't know the answer is that they worked cheap number one for the people who want the river cheap labor cheap labor is the answer the other side of it are you you're talking about\nPeople don't want to give the money the people who are behind these policies are damn wells making sure that you and others are going to give your money they're not going to be giving there but the answer\nThe answer to the question is because the left wants\nPower and power to them is more and more people in capable of self reliance\nMore and more people in capable of helping themselves and the best most concentrated group of people that fit that bill are a bunch of poor ill educated or an educated people don't even speak the language\nFlooding the southern border you get 'em in their human beings we're a compassionate country they have to be fed they have to be taken care of the Democrats want the credit for doing all that they want to get these people registered to vote as quickly as they can they looking at a purely and simply as voters\nIt's not about compassion and it's not about giving them a good life is not about any of the things that they want you to think it is it strictly about creating let me put it this way rarely the Democratic party\nAnd do not doubt me on this and you would you do to research your journalism career you will find that this is the case of the Democratic party needs a permanent underclass\nOf uneducated or poorly educated people who are not capable of economic sulfur live because they can't speak the language\nBecause they don't have any education does our prime democratic voters\nThose are the exact kinds of people to Democrats want to build a majority around because they won't be for ever grateful I e dependence on Democrats and will constantly be voting for Democrats no matter what else happens that's\nThat's the reason behind it nobody will ever own up to it nobody will ever admit it\nBut what they are really is just on a documented Democrats it's not that they're undocumented citizens or aliens undocumented Democrats that's their status right now and the objective is to get them documented to get them registered\nAnd to take care of them give them health care make their track here make their trip you're worth it\nBy giving them exactly what they're coming for now some of them are going to be able to take care of themselves so I'm not going to get here and I'm going to run rings around people some in any group of people that large are going to have a wide disparity in some of them are going to be quite confident\nBut those are going to be the self starters and those are not that people Democrats are interested in I just really hideous I guess I just I guess really hideous thing of Democrats what people need people\nWho are\nIncapable of self reliance and that's not helping those people at all that is not compassionate Democrats want you to think that's all they are and they are none of it it's the exact about they're using these people and hoping that they never amount to much\nThey don't have much faith in him anyway but they are great voters great dependent voters and thereby eyes so\nThat's what this is about look I'm I'm Glad you called rarely you are exceptionally well spoken your home schooling is

in anti Semitism in this country\nNow when they step is neither my wife and rocket remember there ever recording this before even after the ferret contour my comments I'm also during the report when addressing the issue of armed security for places like the synagogue\nMore than one person commented that if we started this when you're ... and\nI couldn't help but think what a classic liberal

fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more interesting they never worry about where is this going to end\n\nBut if you if you do things that give people

can say that they are being received by Trump targets I'm Sorry\nI didn't fall off the turnip truck ever and certainly not yesterday and the world of October surprises coupled with all the other

anymore they have gone fulltime destroyed Trump every second of every minute pretty much of every day\nThat's what they do so they have this panel I guess if they put together\nAnd they're talking about what happened in the synagogue shooting and we\nHave to look closely at the poison being spread sometimes on television sometimes out of the mouths of political leaders and often times on ugly dark corners of social media yeah it can be pretty ugly\nAnd it goes on the first panelist as Bill Kristol or never Trump her he attacks Fox News\nI'm like hello what we can't have conservatives in my I support mainstream conservatism\nBill I don't know what happened to you\nI support original is on the Supreme Court I support lower taxes less government burdensome regulation I support energy independence I support legal immigration I support border security\nI support peace through strength at a tough national security posture with a strong military to defend the values that we all believe it\nAnd I support you know a free press even to be wrong even criticize the media for being role\nAt a Washington Post columnist comes out some woman I've never heard of Margaret Sullivan you know her praising or analysis and the Democratic threats et cetera et cetera reads like a list of Sean Hannity's free broad ... broadcast crib notes\nAnd that is asked point blank if she blame people on the right like Kennedy for the violence\nAs a martyr about this this week uh with regards to the bomb or a tax ah the suspicious packages you said you know looking all his target city this reads like a list of Sean Hannity's pre broadcast ... notes that was when you put it in your Washington Post on again are you blaming the hands of the world\nI think they have a share of I'm sort of the wrapping up of hatred um without regard for a wedding perfect my feet and without much regard for the truth I mean the way things are being patch on Fox and the and\nA pro Trump right wing media is dangerous and it's destructive so I think we need to call it what it is\nA ... Lewis was on from the Daily Beast of all players and he actually was the only one that made even a little sense he said the only thing I Would add is tomorrow it could be Hannity's targeted\nRepublican sessions have perverse incentives to Gen off their base for elections I think a cable news has incentives to a gentleman anger and anxiety and passion for ratings same thing with ... with clicks and tweets\nA I agree with everything that we've set so far today the only thing I Would add is\nTomorrow it could be Sean Hannity who was targeted for a Republican congressman who was targeted and why agreed with the condemnation of what Fox has done in terms of getting off this anger over the caravan I think that this is a much more widespread problem\nWell it is more widespread than I have had far more instances that I'm willing to talk about a real credible threats towards me and my family including the one that I did share last week\nWith white powder purported to be anthrax sent to a my office and one of my employees having to spend an entire day in isolation scared out of our mind\nAnd it's been worse but obviously these people are not listening to what I'm saying\nBecause I have been saying we've got to know what what do I advocate I'm like okay I Want I Want these principles stood up for\nI fight for the American forgotten men and women I fight for lower taxes less pure bureaucratic regulation energy independence Supreme Court nominees that believe in the constitution\nI Believe we should secure our borders legal immigration is the thing is I I Believe that my entire life and career a strong military security for the American people a strong stand against evil in our time\nNot that complicated\nKnow what the democratic agenda is if they win it's gonna be okay we want to impeach Trump endless investigations they said they want their crumbs back\nI Know what the democratic agenda is if they win it's gonna be okay we want to impeach Trump endless investigations they said they want their crumbs back we know they support sanctuary cities open borders and the elimination of ice and they think Obamacare works\nAnd it doesn't you know you had an MSNBC you know literally pressing the Israeli ambassador termer the blame Trump for the synagogue attack that's how sick it's gotten\nYou know ABC Trump is at the center of all the political violence no he's not but I guess it's\nAn easy blame game so now we've taken the predictable every two four years Republicans were racist and sexist and massaging us than Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic\nAnd they weren't dirty air and water and they want children to die and they want granny thrown over the cliff and now it's that they are somehow inciting violence in the country no they're not\nIt's not true it's never been true\nAnd it's not any conservative I Would ever support and then the case of this guy that shot up the synagogue it was a very ill and anti Semite who also hated Donald Trump but that doesn't stop them from saying and literally advancing\nThat narrative you know this is you know watch\nWatching the Washington Post alone is unbelievable Fox deserve their headlights Fox News and the rest of the right wing media can escape responsibility\nOh I've been the biggest supporter of Israel that I Know in the mainstream media have been my entire career friends with Bebe Netanyahu going back decades than there during the war and been there and other times reporting\nShowing people the tunnels that nobody else in the media would show them friends who they who Brock formerly Shimon Peres\nLet's name names according to the Washington Post Trump's hate and lives are inciting extremist\nOh this extreme is in the synagogue hated Trump those are the Washington Post headlights that you got\nTrump the G O P defiant amid allegations that incendiary rhetoric these are the same people\nOn CNN fake news they couldn't identify 'em mom for who they are these phony hypocrites Trump blames it and you know something when the media live twenty four seven and they get called out that's too bad that is not a call for violence\nUnbelievable the times that we're living now here is um where we are the Senate is interesting 'cause there's two races you can add maybe\nTo the let's watch column and I would say that would be West Virginia where Joe Manchin is down by two in the latest poll and Menendez is barely hanging on to a lead in New Jersey by three now do I think both of those races are going to be won by Republicans\nAh maybe West Virginia New Jersey's hard ... possible people in New Jersey clearly a\nFed up with an end us then I think it's too close to call on either the gubernatorial race I have no idea why Floridians are flirting with Gillum who's got a radical agenda in Florida Rick Scott's done a fantastic job as governor and\nBe a perfect complement for the Republican majority in the Senate I think Marsha Blackburn hangs on we got Josh Hawley now in the lead in Missouri we got Dean Heller holding on to his lot hopefully that's an important race in Nevada", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Kachina Village",
