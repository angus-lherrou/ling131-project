but\nThey have been good on this I think they've handled it properly with the seriousness deserves and also the resolve that an injustice has also occurred here we'll see what senator snowflake is running for president yesterday in Massachusetts does to do and say about it McConnell\nSaying earlier today that he wants to vote this week in the Senate now for that to happen Jamie ... pre reminds us of the majority leader must file cloture by Wednesday that's tomorrow will be here tomorrow in the nation's capital in order to force a\nFinal vote by Saturday otherwise you vote wouldn't officially be this week I'm so for example if the cloture vote\nIs if you file cloture on Wednesday the final votes on Saturday if you file it on Thursday it's on Sunday violet on friday the vote would be next Monday if you file cloture on Saturday It's Tuesday depending on when the FBI report comes in\nSo that's going to be wide open and whether or not the\nThree Republican senators go along with endless investigations is ultimately I guess going to be up to them Lindsey Graham who's going to join us later was on Hannity last night and I thought he had a pretty good idea I said you know what we can turn this whole election and thirty five days into a referendum on Brecht capital\nWhat would happen if something really where did occur and where one vote short here's what I Would tell the press [noise] that would appeal the\nAnd it to the ballot box [noise]\nThis good man should not be destroyed [noise] saw a few legitimize this process by one vote short will be onto the next person\nI hate to be the next person nominated I Would feel horrible that we destroyed cabin out [laughter] so what would I Do\nI Would nominate him and that would take this case to the American painful and ask voters in Indiana and Missouri and North Dakota and other places for ... saying who was nominated to got to be president and see if they are loaded on to appeal the verdict up their senator\nSo if you were saying you for a one vote short here saying how would appeal the case of the American people\nOkay\nI you know what at this point and thirty five days let me tell you what's at stake everything that I've been telling you about why vitamin saying this for six months or longer now\nThis is the most important mid term election in our lifetime if you liked the progress that I just described to you then\nGoing to happen by the way Donald Trump this just went up on and read on the Drudge Report Trump gain millions\nFrom questionable tax strategies according to the New York times I guess they're getting off I guess maybe they think they're losing the vote on judge Kavanaugh so President Trump participated in question about tax strategy is in the Nineteen nineties\nAnd allowed him to accrue millions of dollars in additional wealth from his father's real estate empire according to the New York times newspaper reported that Trump and his siblings set up a sham corporation\nTo help this guy's otherwise taxable income that came from gifts from their parents\nOkay the IRS has been investigating him I guess for most of his adult life\nYou know so I ... a big shock there but this is what's at stake you want you want to go back because this is the enlisted investigation and do you want to reward the party of slander and blood Jimmy\n'cause that's the Democratic party you know think of this five weeks from tonight you're going to tune into the news midterms\nBig election night big coverage all the networks you have the opportunity to shock the world again\nYou remember they never thought Donald Trump could when they never believed that can happen\nNow imagine you there are two things that are going to happen\nOn election night five weeks from now one is you're going to turn on your TV set and you're going to see a bunch of guinea liberals happy to announce that Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house and maybe even Senator Chuck Schumer\nThe liberal from New York is going to be the Senate majority leader\nOr you can tune in and watch the results come in and they have to announce that the U.S house of representatives remains in control of the Republicans and that the Republicans have picked up\nTwo three four five seats in the United States Senate which would render by the way Collins Murkowski and snow flake
