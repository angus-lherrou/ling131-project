countries in Central America South America\nAnd just independent leaves some days separation of park there's a story of a shockingly unforeseen increase any polio cases in the United states and the stories feature medical professionals\nWho are stumped they can't figure out why this was happening they they they can't they can't even make educated guesses as to what might be the origins of this\nLittle a couple of days go by and there's another story of a mass numbers of people from various parts of the country a world South America Central America there's no question these things are related well I say there's no question common sense tells you there's\nA relationship here but you're you're absolutely right there cannot be any official ... if you have the CDC or anybody else a stab ... the fact that the new cases of polio or other diseases that we have previously cures and stamped out another showing up again\nIf there were ever official linkage to undocumented people arriving ... wow\nCan't have that have have that at all so\nThe connection isn't made its left for people to conclude themselves if they\nIf they do but you see it goes even beyond that\nI remember one of the things I mentioned the Hannity today he he was resigning all of the economic improvements\nStatistically a lover of things that have happened during the Trump presidency\nAnd at some point towards the end of I stopped him and I said you you were going to realize something though that there's an entire political party\nTo whom the news you just mentioned is bad\nIt makes them man they're angry about it they're trying to suppress this said they're not happy\nWith good economic news they're not happy that people's lives are improving they're not happy that there are jobs go over to choose from they're not happy that wages are going up that people are getting bonuses they are not happy\nThat more people are working when they're not happy the economy is growing to the point of um storming all the new people that want jobs so why is that\nWho in the world to be unhappy by this who can be made unhappy by this the answer is very clear I don't want to give it all the way but I told him that I think\nWhatever arguments we're having here they are still\nAll circling and focused on the age old argument between conservative and liberalism and that is the role of government and people's lives\nAnd the answer to why people on the left are unhappy at great economic news is because they can't claim credit for it and it threatens their whole existence where in people are not capable of this and need to vote Democrat\nHim credit for it and it threatens their whole existence where in people are not capable of this and need to vote Democrat to basically live\nThey need to vote Democrat need to continue to vote Democrat because only the government can provide for people only the government can we can protect people against injustice discrimination and so\nAs as looney tunes as a as the Democratic party is getting and as they have incorporated more and more psychological disorders that people have and now are turning those disorders into political causes\nThat then demand the government fix we have an impossible situation the government cannot fix psychological disorders the government's not responsible for fixing all\nOf these problems that these people have that have made them victims by becoming victims they are absolved if any responsibility\nAnd they are demanding that government chair that government fix while the more independence excess people have the more people\nRely on themselves get jobs improve their lives just the fact that Democratic Party gets mad as that is all anybody on the need to know but at the same token new instances of polio and the Democratic party's not upset about it\nNew instances of diseases breaking out we've already short and they're not concerned about it\nBecause it is harmful if anybody makes the connection how

day or two so if we can get to the truth don't rush to judgment but it's beginning to look like they killed the sky\nAnd probably the only way they got 'em out wisdom pieces bits and pieces that means they chop them up and the the I think turkey and air do on probably has some evidence because you know they would probably have wire the Saudi embassy\nAnd I'm thinking there's no way that happens without the crown prince knowing that's what my gut tells me now you say Hannity or you don't know and I'm saying you're right I'm I'm whole withholding judgment but that's my guess where we're headed with this\nAnd I'm watching Democrats because they think they've got this president corner on this issue what are you going to do now\nWhat are you going to do you you want to sell a military parts or when you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars in jobs for Boeing and all our big military contractors um you're talking about tens and tens of thousands of jobs in America\nIf in fact this is a cut off point\nAnd I think there's many ways that the president many options ill have in terms of dealing with it when the time comes and the president we know him he says he's going to do something he tends to keep his word I Can't think of an instance where he has\nBut here's what's frustrating to me all through the election and twenty sixteen on this program I sat here and I told you how much money Hillary Clinton took from all of these countries the practitioner Maria\nWhere marital rape isn't a crime where women are told by men how to dress where women need permission to travel or even travel abroad some cases can even leave the house without a male relative\nAges of backwards repressive you know the accuracy and some of these countries Kuwait among them the Saudi Arabians among them and others\nAnd their countries they kill gays and lesbians their countries that persecute Christians and Jews the Clintons took millions and millions and tens and tens of millions from these countries for their foundations and guess who we never heard ever criticize any of the policies\nThat treat women horribly gays and lesbians horribly Christians and Jews horribly Hillary Clinton\nThey bought her silence nobody ever talked about it I think put me\nAnd it's the same with the immigration side of the equation I don't if you grow up in that culture that abuses women\nThat is the antithesis of our constitutional republic I'm Sorry we need to know that you were jak those values that are the antithesis of the values that we hold dear in near and cherish in this country\nNobody ever asks the Democrats about that or the same thing with ... I mean we we leave these guys in Benghazi and they're making deals with you know cut off me\nGood grief\nSuch hypocrisy I mean they claimed to have a monopoly a compassionate all this but they want that was said it's complicated because you have an ... an unprecedented alliance that's emerged in the as a result\nOf a rainy and hit Gemini and rainy and ... you know ambition to acquire nuclear weapons and the Iranians that chant death to Israel death to America burn the American flag burning the Israeli flag", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "18"}
