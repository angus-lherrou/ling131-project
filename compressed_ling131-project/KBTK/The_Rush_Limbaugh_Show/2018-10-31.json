Grassley\nSenator Grassley there's just a recent report Fox News has it right now saying that the Kavanaugh\nCircus and the caravan might be the two big issues that same for the geo paid now I I haven't seen a specific some Senator Grassley is quote unquote report so I don't know if he used the phraseology same with a GOP or\nIf that is the media as they are interpreting and reporting\nOn um on on um\nWhat grass Elise words are that if it's if it's Grassley\nSave the geo paved ... that would that would indicate that grass lately I really don't want to go there I don't want to assume Grassley said until I have\nOne he actually said I'm not going to even speculated nor the way the media is reporting on of his save\nThe GOP means it was over we were in we were I mean we were headed for the gigantic will way we're going to lose everything and\nThen that Kavanaugh thing happening in a caravan thing I might save the GOP or other people saying well if it was going to save a GOP it didn't because all of that momentum was interrupted a pipe bomber and the synagogue murders in Pittsburgh and that would have just destroyed any momentum\nI yeah I Love people in Washington and they're conventional wisdom okay so they are citizens their businesses the news I I'm going to explain those three of their business is the news\nThey eat it they live they breathe it they rank grudge attain if they owe lemonade at they absorb it it's news\nThey think everybody does it to a certain extent and so they get all hot to trot about things and they see the caravan might be helping Trump and they like it or don't like it doesn't matter and then they say they Kavanaugh situation that Democrats blew that sky high and sort of home and this was really going to help them then the pipe\nBomb in the Senate guy shouldn't come along and they feel like their motivation or\nNot too late to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded let's pretend that some of the momentum was lost located we got plenty of time we got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who did it\nWhat its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh to hurt Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\n\nHere's another one is that Kevin on confirmation circus we're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold on the line and so abused in Seoul raped by Kavanaugh if the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why is justice not being sought any longer\nAnd the answer to the question is it was never about the women\nBecause none of the women had any evidence it was about one thing only and that was killing the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh even if it meant destroying his family and his career his future and his\nLife and they failed so now it's on to whatever is next and I guess it's we need a ban on white guys from Don Lemon\nThe real murderers in America the real problem is white men we've got a Muslim ban we've got this band we don't have a ban on white guys and we need a ban on white white guys white men have now become the primary issue

responsible for pipe bombs now Trump responsible for Senate guy should Trump responds more Trump responsible for the airplane crash next week when they get around to that\nNone of it is real\nNone of the news is real it's all manufactured\nSo what does it mean what does it mean that we're not getting any updates from the drive by media about all of these women were so mistreated by Kevin ...\nWhat does it mean that the Democrats are not being asked by the media whether they support Kevin O's impeachment wise it's all been dropped\n\nHave the media have given up investigating the story they obsessed over\n\nWhy have the media given up investigating the story they obsess over for nearly a month\n\nFor weeks September and October that's all\nThe median talked about [noise] where's the follow up\nIf Kavanaugh was as they say that story should not have\nGone away the women still suffered the women did not get justice cabinet got confirmed where is the news where is the continuing investigation will it doesn't exist because it was all made up about capital\nClassic Democratic Party media operation so is the aftermath of the pipe bomb story and so as the aftermath of the Jewish

immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program so over Thirty years in one white thank you very much A L L for the call I really I'm Glad you got through to remind us about Ellis at Amazon ... not only by the way we are they checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nWe we're a much newer in younger country them and we had an entirely different attitude about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were allowed in\nHad to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they handed to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nYou had to learn about American history you have to promise that you're going to do your best to learn the English language if it was restricted because it was predicated and based on the fact that we weren't in charge of who was going to live here\nThe world was not in title it was entirely different vantage it back then but even then\nI read books I remember conversations with my grandfather who lived to be a hundred and four he was born in Eighteen nineties\nHis life\nSpanned pre electricity to going to the moon in his life he saw all of that you grew up on a farm had to go plow fields before school every day\nCome home after school work the farm and so forth and like all the stories everything they didn't sell is what they got to eat um\nHe was one of the first in his wedding in the first to ah to go to college became a lawyer\nBut he\nCame from the horse and buggy days and no electricity to manned space flight landing on the motives thought all and I remember I was I was home in\nMissouri I guess Nineteen Ninety two years after program against the Nineteen Ninety\nAnd he's around Ninety these these uh ... close to a hundred years old and he's asked me so what what are the big things it was hard of hearing but it's not as you couldn't hear the radio easily one of the big thing is being discussed on your program say immigration\nWe called the pop pop you would not\nBelieve it I mean I I I'm dealing with people who are just so anti immigration wouldn't run this was\nThis was folks this was all them back in Nineteen Ninety it wasn't just strictly southern border immigration and he said you know I remember those debates all the way back in the early Nineteen hundreds back in the days Ellis Island you immigration has been\nA\nPolarizing subject to this country for as long as we have been doing it and he started telling me stories of the\nUh efforts to image soon new arrivals from western in Eastern Europe\nAnd he was telling me that there were so many people who didn't want any of those people from Eastern Europe Western Europe ever people with his point was the arguments haven't changed the issue has been something that is Constance\nBut the one thing that has changed he was talking about even back in Nineteen Ninety when we were talking about he was talking about legal immigration\nHe was saying but back in the early Nineteen hundreds away they've you know the controversy was about legal immigration and even with the legal immigration where people opposed to opening up Ellis Island and preventing masses of humanity to come in\nAnd for reasons similar to what her stuff today the differentiating thing today is that legal immigration is seldom even discussed and we have both\nPolitical parties in predominantly one of them now advocating for lawlessness advocating for illegal immigration and then using opponents of illegal immigration as examples of racism and bigotry\nSo forth so while the issue has always been around and it's always been a controversial thing\nImmigration and how we manage it\nThe idea that illegal aliens should be automatically granted citizenship for amnesty upon their arrival\nThat is what's new to this debate and that is what the uh the Democrats in the American left today are are advocating\nAnd they're doing something on the premise that America is responsible for the economic plight of these people that we\nAs a superpower have taken on fair portion of the world's resources we've gone around the world and taking\nWhat we want and we have not compensated people privately we've tried to impose our way of life and so in liberalism economics\nIs a zero sum game\nNot compensated people privately we've tried to impose our way of life and so in liberalism economics is a zero sum game if the American people are wealthy than somebody has to be\nPoor out there and so therefore the American people are guilty of something\nThere was an unequal distribution of wealth elapsed as in all of these countries in Central America South America so poor compared to us and\nIt's not a coincidence got to be our fault somehow so it's only fair that these people are fleeing a rotten economy is in war torn strife that the United states allow them in as a means of apology\nAnd it becomes a definition of compassion and the real purpose behind it is to transform America and to kind of nation it was never intended are found it to be and that's the difference is legal and illegal immigration\nSubject has been around it's been controversial for as long as it has been happening but the idea that illegal immigrants have legal claim on whatever they want in\nThis country that's that is what's new\nAnd the education

hill or were there was a lot of doctors for a long time still is but at least shining brighter we lead in the world others will follow\nA more prosperity and peace um\nYou'd want to go backwards that's how important this election is right now\nI think it's a lot of things I vote him\nLook I take a vote for any Democrat and any district for four hundred and thirty five house seats up for grabs his vote for ... because your opponent will vote for Nancy Pelosi and vote with her I'm sure Ninety eight percent of the time just like in the Senate if you vote for any Democrat you're voting for sure\nUm to me a lot of it is you know look at the limitation of due process presumption of innocence during the Kavanaugh hearings\nA look at the the agenda Democrats\nIs it's it's out there they want their crumbs back because they want the taxes the tax cuts that are putting a lot of money in the pockets of middle class Americans they want it back they want to eliminate eyes open borders they want to keep Obamacare and how they're running on health care is just\nThe definition of just or death city considering they ... how many there are counties I read in Iowa that have seen two hundred percent increases in their premiums people lost their doctors and plans and they have one health care option that's it one provider that's\nIt yeah and and those that are paying it are paying twenty to thirty thousand dollars a year or their premiums their deductibles are so high they can't even if they just risk and don't even go to a doctor but you're exactly right\nMy opponent we had three opportunities to distance herself from Nancy Pelosi and she said she couldn't think of a an issue where they could be separated so what's that mean she's a rubber stamp for hopefully not Speaker Pelosi but increasing taxes\nOpen borders doubling down on government run health care and of course what they've tried to keep on of the rock shot and you know this and our listeners now this impeachment\nMhm now that an endless investigation but not into the deep state\nUm which of course you know we've seen massive abuses of power not rank and file FBI agent not rank and file a Justice Department an intelligence people but\nThey do their job every day but just a few abusing power at the highest levels the upper echelon well listen this is an important race it's on our top thirty we have the top Seventy races if you want to go to our interactive map at ... dot com and the most important house races that will tip the balance of power six days from now\nAnd one week from today we'll be talking about those results certainly David Young Iowa's third district is one of those important races we wish you the best in this race\nWe can't take anything for granted go to David Young for Iowa dot com to volunteer and help us make sure we keep the majority thank you Sean for all you do you\nBet welcome a ball the best you and six days ah it's tough out there nobody can predict what certain said but I Will tell you they don't I I just there's something about um some things not clicking with me\nAnd I never you never really have a feel for how the house was going to go twenty hen might be an exception where\nI mean it was a massive landslide and you could see it coming same thing I Would argue when Bill Clinton became president Nineteen Ninety four remember Republicans have been out of power for forty years that Newt Gingrich became the speaker of the house\nYou know Sylvia look at history and this is what Republicans are up against their forty five retirement and a headwind of history that usually the the party in power loses a lot of seats in the first\nMidterm but then like in the case of Bill Clinton it was Newt Gingrich in many ways Newt saving of Clinton because things got better\nBecause Newt Gingrich forced Clinton into what led to balance budgets and and serious reforms in Washington\nAnd I think the same thing you know if you go to a bomb I mean it was just a white powder and twenty ten ... especially after Obamacare and ... you know the fact that Democrats have their that's their main talking point now\nI'm this is really fascinating to me this a brass means the poll out today I had to go back and double checked it showing that African American support for the president is now hit an all time high of forty percent\nI mean that's a five hundred percent improvement if you go back to election day twenty sixteen when he got eight percent of the African American\nI mean that's a five hundred percent improvement\nIf you go back to election day twenty sixteen when he got eight percent of the African American vote in the country in the same survey\nTrump's approval ratings say is at its highest at this point in the fifty percent plus range\nAnd I think the highest level of support for any Republican going back to at least Dwight Eisenhower if not\nBefore and and all the media likes to go after asked me to ... I don't know why he's a great guy smart poster but you know they say oh you are right wing polling operation but I Do remind you that ... was the most accurate polling twenty sixteen\nSo if that is even close to forty percent that could have a profound impact\nOn the midterm elections but again it's all up to now the interesting developments as relates to the issue of the caravan\nUm and I think some people have been over the top and what they've been saying about it it's a lot of distance between here and where they started at the southern border of Mexico and uh\nNow you have and I look there was only see most people that come into this country illegally I think that most people come here because we are a land of milk and honey\nHoping opportunity and the American dream and when you live in poverty and countries that have little says hero opportunity and freedom it's very appealing to come to America now we're only asking that you do it legally only asking that you respect our laws are sovereignty our borders\nAnd I'd venture a guess that Ninety nine point eight percent of the people in that caravan want a better life and that they've been told that they're going\nTo be able to get into America that's not going to happen the president's been very clear\nUm the left this meteor pushing a narrative that the thousands of of migrants\nAnd from Central America and elsewhere are fleeing violence in their homeland but in an interview with National Public radio on Monday the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some of the people some probably a tiny tiny percentage point two percent\nOr you know last source our quarter reporting that she identified MS Thirteen members because of their tattoos that would give that'd be a give away um but actually the Mexican ambassador the U. S. describes some I'm sure a tiny percentage is very violent now nobody can vouch for any one person that wants to cross the border\nWe're asking that people come here legally if we had a border wall we wouldn't have a risk of thousands of people at once coming across the border the president has said fifty two hundred troops down there\nAnd he's not going to let them in ... he because they'll be thousands and thousands behind them we don't have room to take it everybody we ever right as a country we have sovereignty or nation built on a on a constitutional\nRepublic system the rule of law\nAnd we have border laws and we asked the people respect our borders and our sovereignty and just come in legally and we have an opportunity to vet them and make sure that they are coming for the right reasons they can sustain themselves and they don't want to bring harm to our citizens that are already here", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "31"}
