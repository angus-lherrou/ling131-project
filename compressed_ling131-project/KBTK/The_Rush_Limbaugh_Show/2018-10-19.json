well\nThey keep uh you know I'm a ... I voted for Trump Madden Trump voter and America First and most historic sense and I'm an American patriot so take that in context what my question your\n... how can the United states the allies with countries and you mentioned this in the first part of your monologue we're allies with the Saudi Arabia and Israel how can we be allies with Saudi Arabia when the Pentagon papers released and twenty six team showed\nThat they funded nine eleven also Israel has attacked us in the past like a used his liberty with all of unfair can you clear that are forming\nWell on the Saudis side yeah the uh the the Israeli spy on us to everybody spies on everybody\nYou know Jonathan Pollard it was an Israeli spider got caught and the Israelis wanted him back on harmed we said screw you you know where your benefactor old spy on us and I said yes we do and we're going to continue the spike us we can't trust anybody where Israel\nAnd particularly when Democrats are in the White House that's a factor now when it comes to the Saudis I Want to share with you because your question here is really good\nI remember after nine eleven happened when when I learned that\nIt was either all Nineteen or white Ninety percent eighty percent of the Nineteen hijackers were Saudi\nI remember I was talking to William F Buckley junior about number of things not just this and I brought that up and I remember him getting frustrated with me about it\nHe said what does it ever doing anything I ... I don't understand the Saudi Government supposedly is an ally and yet these hijackers come from Saudi Arabia are you saying the Saudi royal family is behind this I said how can we say that they're not\nThat is when I began to try to learn about the relationship to the Saudi of the Saudi royal family to Islam and that's what I started asking experts\nAre at at one of the people I talked to was Andy McCarthy again because he has tried as a United States attorney assistant United States attorney southern district of Manhattan he was the lead prosecutor\nOn the blind shake case\nAnd it was Andy who said that he thought the blind check was just acting out to being a radical\nUh inventor of various aspects of Islam\nAs part of his technique to mobilize and create even more membership and his group and then he he started reading the things that the blind shake believes when he found out none of this is made up this this this call for terrorism dealing with infidels it's right there and look around if you read it right\nThis is exactly what what is in the book and he was stunned when he\nHe told me was so\nWhen you didn't realize that the Saudi royal family is in charge of world wide Islam because the holy sites or their mecca and Medina Medina\nI've found that it is absolutely true that the Saudi royal family\n\nIs essentially the the shield and the impetus behind worldwide Islam well in Saudi\nIs essentially the the shield and the impetus behind worldwide Islam well in Saudi Arabia\nThe branch of Islam that is I for just to make it easier here and being understood terrorists Islam comes from ...\nFrom those you heard me say this yesterday I beg your indulgence ... hobby Islam is where they really radical clerics and the moms are who are welcoming\nAnybody they can into their in their mosques and just literally converting them into\nSuicide bombers terrorists and what have you under the auspices of Islam and the Saudi\nRoyal family stood by and let it all happened whether they were instrumental in advocating you don't know but Saudi funded charities all over the world promoted while hobby is\nAnd that's what I went back to Mr Buckley or so I I don't I don't see how the Saudi royal family the Saudi Government can be separated from his Nineteen hijackers\nWell that's why it's interesting to tell the story of the crown prince Mohammed bin solve Mont Mohammed bin ... wants to if we do believe\nHe wants to reform the Saudi Arabian peninsula the whole country and its relationship to Islam\nAll because of money economics primarily he doesn't like the fact that Saudi Arabia is solely dependent on the sale of oil for all of its wealth he wants to branch out\nHe wants other people investing other industries individuals investing in Saudi Arabia for things unrelated dollars in federal dollars oil\nSo he sought out the interest in Hollywood Silicon Valley and the typical places in other countries as well\nAnd part and parcel of his reform is the\nWord abandonment or the uh distancing ...\n\nAccording to have been some on Saudi Arabia cannot modernize and cannot achieve his reform goals if ... is still\nThe\nBranch of Islam associated with the Saudi royal family\nWell\nThis brings us to ... again and the Muslim Brotherhood they don't want any of these reforms they don't want any western influences in\nAny Islamic country much less Saudi Arabia where mecca diner they do not want ... watered down they do not\nThey want the Arab Spring they don't want secularism anywhere and Mohammed bin ... among represents a bit of that it's fascinating that he's been brought to a screeching halt on these reforms\nWith the death of shaggy this has brought to a screeching and now there's a story today that the royal family they they have a council you might I often wondered well who determines but these kings have countless sons they've got Fifteen different wives they've got kids with every one of their wives so a Saudi king can have twenty sons\nHow do you determine which one's the crown prince how does your determine which one's going to be as air it's not just first in line they have a council they have an inter family council a royal family council that\nDetermines the winning edge of the crown prince the heirs and in what order\nThen saw him on Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of the current king\nSolomon\nHe was chosen largely because of his reform ideas but now a story out today says it the widow if it's true or not the royal family is\nHaving a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammad bin saw him on as grounds friends now many people think that this was up to the king the king determines what your his sons is gonna be the next king but it's not the case\nSo all of these plans for modernization if they were true I have to throw that I was a cabin up all these plans for reform\nWe put ourselves with the test every day we are athletes that are deemed\nVery boot barred\nBest is yet to come\nBack

and\nAnyway got man I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was in Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell yeah but it ... there's not a Britain has been laying stopping anybody from crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting it remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump has a phony is not who he says he is\nAnd they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\nHow I don't think that could happen and he's done too much into a little time\nOh I don't either get either leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this\nCaravan is uh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall\nBut his point was how many continuing resolutions that we have independent budget deals if we had and then there's not\nAnd we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for it\n\nYet not serious money and certainly not serious construction there for his theory was that the Democrats are trying to demonstrate there is never going to happen and Trump doesn't even care than it ain't\nGoing to happen\nAnd what better way to illustrate isn't four thousand people storming the border and not being stopped\nAh let's see grabs sound bites number four team Nikki

they show up and it's a night of comedy Ninety five percent and the other the other five percent of the speeches um get serious and political and they all show up and it's incredible to that the Al Smith dinner\nOr at least the ones I've watched who ever writes the jokes for these candidates for this center is they they got to be among the best every candidate there have been some exception exceptions but seems like every candidate just has some of the best funniest material\nAnd I you know I Wonder where they find it and it's obviously they're hiring joke writers but for where we don't know well Nikki Haley showed up at the Al Smith dinner last night I mean she didn't storm in there she was invited obviously but this is causing people\nTo believe that Nikki Haley has got some residential perspiration\nGoing on and in fact she might Nikki Haley said something less that we don't have this on tape or in audio but she chastised Trump last night she said in America in domestic\nPolitics we do not call our political opponents evil\nAnd of course the room say hey\nWe do not caught well who else does but Trump he calls the press evil and the Democrats evil and so it's that comment that that made people think I ha she's she's actually go unfortunately going to go for the Republican nomination at some point maybe not twenty twenty twenty twenty four\nAnd she is
