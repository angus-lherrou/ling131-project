the first wage increase since Nineteen Ninety two\nAnd now they want the crumbs back and then they won't open borders and to eliminate ice and they want to keep that great design plan called Obamacare member keep your doctor planning and save a whole lot of money\nAnd millions lost their doctor their plans they're paying three four times more in some states and its bankrupting them now\nIn two years because we got the largest tax cuts in history in two years because we got rid of\nMore burdensome regulation than the last five or six presidents combined in terms of the the the burdens that we place on business business has been leaving this country even Obama recognizes these jobs and they're not coming back\nWell they're not coming back for you because they can't make any money with you being president that's what his incentivize companies to leave their home country and set up shop in places like Mexico and and other places abroad\nNow the president is incentivize all these companies to come back and they're investing trillions and when they said that oh he's going to start a trade war with Mexico and Canada well now we got a significantly better deal than we had before which means oh\nAuto parts are going to be made by American workers with a minimum wage is sixteen dollars an hour oh and a half to help American dairy farmers and poultry farmers\nThat's all jobs for the for the you know look the states that had suffered the most uh\nThe the ... the Wisconsin's the Ohio's the Pennsylvania is they're the ones down benefiting from all the president's plan those were the forgotten men and women you know don't forget we have four million new jobs that have been created says the president's elected\nFour million fewer people on food stamps since the president was elected we have the largest growth in manufacturing jobs\nAre in Thirty years since the president's elected we have fourteen states record low unemployment since the president's elected if you break it down demographically record low unemployment African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian\nWorkforce lowest level in sixty five years youth unemployment now at a a fifty five year low\nIt's all because the policies of limited government lower taxes it is incentivized business to grow and grow and build factories manufacturing centers and and it's only the beginning because the president\nAllowing pipelines to be built in the United states again finally the president opening opening up an war with the vast oil reserves resources we have there the president singlehandedly save the coal mining industry industry West Virginia are you paying attention\nUm and and Kentucky and some other states and then of course we can drill in the United states natural gas restrictions lifted\nThis is going to create literally millions of high paying career jobs for Americans\nAnd it will give us national security benefits that we never dreamed of because not only will we never be needing to import a single barrel of oil again from the middle east will also be creating safety and security for European allies\nThat's what the future holds that's what the election is about and
