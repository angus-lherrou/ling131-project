Ninety seven voice was the big topic\n\nHere's another story of this from Bloomberg News Paul's could be missing a Republican syringe\nHere's why certainly looks like Democrats will do well in the midterms but this cycle present some unusual risks for pollsters not ... the mainstream media does this every election cycle\nWhere it was all this out for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave and there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys assuring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's got to be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans\nNow polls could be missing a GOP surge late surge and guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen Hillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up or at least some of it\nIt's a good reminder that even mid October surveys can miss late change the story written before the bombs\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention there's no\nWay that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the ah the Swedes here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously a set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose\nThere is a translation for this in addition to what are you saying here you Democrats have got to stop\nUp posing Trump just do opposed Trump\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela sponsored and pay for it is if that if that's true\nThen Venezuela also means Iran and the ... smokes\nA lot of people on our side have jumped say George Soros yeah maybe but if Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying as Venezuela if it's Venezuela that's also Iran and the ... regardless\nWe had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates didn't let those people in for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not one of the American people are right now\nThe only common sense a cool thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore Avon lady is saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security this doesn't help us a mob the seven thousand ten thousand people starving to gauge demanding to be let in that doesn't help us\nWhatever now do you say oh this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickle kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\n[noise] my point is [laughter] none of this\nPanning out the way it was planned no blue wave\nI ... don't misunderstand I don't know what's good I'm not saying that the Democrats may not when the house but I I don't think that going to [noise] I I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it\nBecause I never fall for the left wing media conventional wisdom or the standard ordinary groupthink narrative of the moment whenever it is\nBut it's more than that there's nothing happening in America right now the argues electing Democrats\nNot in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in mass\nThere is no reason to vote Democrat even giving people reasons to vote for the all they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump because Trump's what he's aboard he tweets he's a bad guy his whatever whatever is\n\nThe stunts the Democrats are pulling destroying Kevin on his family sending rice in what looked like rice and the Susan Collins all these monsters nothing the Democrats are doing\nThat's the kind of thing you do to build a movement in a decent society and I still believe that we have one I Believe are decent society is under siege every day are decent society\nStandard and good old normalcy is under assault everyday led by pop culture leftists in Hollywood\nIn Silicon valley and the drive by media we're under assault every day but they have not overturned that yet they have not gotten to the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced\nNormal there's just nothing out there to me\nThat would have people excited about voting for Democrats because the the even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people to vote against Trump against Republicans\nAh I just I don't see it we'll find out if my instincts are off the charts or not\nIn less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters they're the ones panicking so you flip the scenario what\nSense does it make for a conservative Republican to come up with it works here by sending a bunch of bombs that are not going to go off and they're going to be

I think he's talking to his future calling you can't live to be a CNN contributor\nOh that may be what it is you never know what I Want everybody to know at the end and I've been through this I've been through all of it\nI've had you know I mean I Do I Do I Begin to tell the story about\nUnmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no\nPlace in the u._s._a. and he concluded by touting his statement condemning the egregious threats that cetera et cetera and and\nMores coming but that's not what you got the media writer almost instantaneously\nAlmost instantaneously some NBC News reporter named Ben Collins Soros Obama and the Clintons have been viewed as the root of all evil on TALK radio and Fox News for over a decade\nMoney and just say Fox News and talk radio did it I mean this this rush the joke we don't know who did it\nWe have no nobody has a clue who did this\nWhat I can tell you it's no sane rational conservative or Republican that I Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with\nBut it's just so typical the rush to judgment they want to believe what they want to believe because they want the political narrative what's so hypocritical the same people that have been\nTone deaf and final into what has been unfolding now in this country for a month\nHow many women have been confronted and restaurants movie theaters how many times as this happened with you know the chanting in the restaurants with with politicians in their wives even this weekend with McConnell happened twice the Ted Cruz\nOver a conspiracy TV MSNBC there just despicable insinuating this suspicious packages can be tied back to Trump himself and that the intended recipient have all been criticized by the president\nYou've gotta be kidding me\nIs this how twisted let's just take the rhetoric of of who they are every day ... just last night alone I played a bunch of tapes of you know lower thirds of the president\nHe's a liar he says is he's a lawyer fraud this\nI'm Sorry the president flat out by saying Congress was working on a plan and they were coming back before the election it gets hot in the life the change of the story again and so if we're going to guess what eventually the president thinks you're stupid the president thinks people are stupid clear of fish only and parents and in fact ... President Trump tries to play to his base with outright also\nHe's not even trying to hide and slides anymore he's putting all out there in spreading a lot of lines about non why is this\nAll you hear every single day from the mainstream media why is about\nLike what they look this is every election season you get it that we did have an incident\nIf you recall when Steve skull eastern others the shooting took place on the ball field\nAnd I actually I remember saying and I asked my staff to go back and find out what did I say when we found out that the gunman or the person responsible for the shooting that nearly\nKilled Steve ... was a Bernie Sanders supporters is what I said now I I'm not going to do with the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie Sanders was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him so it's Ryan McCarthy ...\nRight and this individual this assailant that we're now getting the information on that you just shared by his own and Bernie Sanders took to the floor of the Senate to condemn it because he was a Sanders supporter suppose one thing I Want but you know what they\nDo it I don't blink Bernie Sanders of course not they would they would blame us yes of course I have to do what I Want to say you know Rush Limbaugh already in the in Oklahoma City bombing and you know they got out there where ... where I Am\nWell this is because these guys are convinced the left that by ratcheting up their rhetoric that they can get away with it and make it a free pass nobody doesn't matter if they do it so here's what you have today right here in Washington DC\nAnd attempted assassination I Hope it's not and I'm praying that you know even as we know Shawn he isn't very serious very very critical reported earlier that he was upgraded a critical condition upgraded from critical that good but he's been critical is what they say well he was in stable\nYeah stable condition you get the point of what I did back I ... you can't blame Bernie for that\nNor can you blame any conservative but we don't know what the motivation is just it's all conjecture and that was being used as a political weapon to bludgeon\nTalk radio Fox and Trump\nIt's just outrageous\n'cause that's not who we are what what did I say yesterday about George Soros I won't play it again now but I said\nHey not this has to stop George Soros spends millions of dollars paying groups to get me off the air\nWe that's not how we settled political differences you know when the sun is out there apparently blaming Donald Trump Donald Trump does not responsible for packages that might have bombs and anthrax or rice\nIn in it it's ridiculous\nYou don't see why you know let me play Hillary Clinton today and Hillary Clinton just what a week ago let's let's just compare\nWere not criminal ripple political party that wants to try\nTo stand for what you care about her only from the Republican whom to\nRecognize an for Star Trek and is it time a\nDeep divisions\nAnd we have to have to do everything we everything we can bring our country to get together\nTo thought we were supposed to be civil ... a week later unless at an Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York you know we must be civil were Americans All right that's not what he would say in a while back when he talked about conservatives that live in New York people like me listen\nTo their problems not me I'm themselves or they're streaming shows\nThat are closer to the extreme conservative\nThat are closer to the extreme conservative stations\nAnd at the end of the day we may have political differences but this is one country we're all Americans he plural bassoon them out of many one and keeping the faith and the dialogue civil\nLaw is very very important and for elected leaders\nWho in many ways set the tone the specially important\nHow often do you work 'cause there's no place in the state of the New York if you're a pro life pro Second Amendment I happen to be libertarian on issues involving sexuality so it's not my issue\nYou know I just very different tone isn't it tell you a little story so I had this and and window lived through this and when the you know we're still very great friends with the lease who\nWorked for me for a long time and she went on to bigger and better things will really proud of her and happy for her and she was a friend of our program we just saw her in Washington when we were last there right yep we just dollar um it was like nine hours when we had what we thought was potentially anthrax sent to my office the Fox right\nUh yeah it was it was actually a little bit more between how long they held her over\nAnd the sad thing is and she was in isolation she was alone we couldn't talk to her even though it was just horrible for her\nAnd it was cordoned off we went to the hospital they wouldn't let us and we couldn't see her because they didn't know if it was ...\nI mean as with all my heart I Can't stand CNN is reporting I think it's fake news but I I feel sorry for the people over CNN Today I've lived through this\nAnd I and Linda on a scale of one to ten the anthrax incident being one how many tens of we had in the course of my career that you know about\nI mean you know we got ten death threats today via letter\nYeah but I mean and it's just a horrible thing there was one particular person at another network I won't say who\nWho's going through a very bad time and going through a lot of threats and picked up the phone don't agree with this person at all and explained everything that I've been through and tried to give my best advice\nI mean this person was upset had to leave their house they had young kids this person you know how to family and you know it's it's hard\nIt's unfortunately part of the environment we live in and that's why I don't understand why there's been so much silence about\nChasing people at restaurants and attacking people in restaurants you know somebody bangs on your table in a restaurant that's an assault that guy should have been arrested\nOr showed up at your house or spent on you or threaten you or followed you know\nI have had all the above\nAnd it's just very very very difficult and how many times if I said keep Obama said when he was president we got to keep our ... our politicians have whoever\nDid this is not a conservative in the sense that maybe they think they are but they're not anybody I Want anything to do with her any conservative once anything to do it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "24"}
