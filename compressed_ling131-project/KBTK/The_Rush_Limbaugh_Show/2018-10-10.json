blobs yes I did it okay well you must not be far away from the border\nExactly alright yeah makes sense\nAh\nWhen we finally got in which stood in line for about five hours finally got into the core of around and there was almost as many women and attendance is there were met\nSomeone when we're there with their mothers somewhat their young children I was amazed at how many women were actually in attendance\nWhy why why were you amazed well\nI just keep hearing that the suburban women has completely left the Republican Party and that was an exact opposite of what I witnessed last side of the political\nWell I can imagine you were surprised if you have you been buying into the idea that women have Republicans because of abortion and Trump being a massage innocent and all that then you show up at a Trump rally and it's it's at least fifty percent women I can imagine it'd be a little boondoggle by that\nIt was I I don't know is that any feedback from any other Trump rallies but you get feedback from but\nWhat about what about housing but you said mothers and daughters were the husbands there could use a tech that men were husbands or wherever they are\nThe guy that I was sitting next to his daughter he took a lot of small dates which brings daughter I was just amazed that the ... I don't think that there's any massage any whatsoever of the Republican base I think that\nOf course there isn't this idea that this Republican war on women isn't completely manufactured ally\nAnd of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it yeah we needed to show a pattern here is that Chris Smith of Ohio your next I'm graduated high\nHigh right very very cold tough yeah thank you\nWas just wondering I was concerned and wanted to get your psyche mentioned that fun of it yesterday but with this novel as it is and Hillary claiming that\nThey're hurting neatness ability right now I'm I just get worried with the mom and they left as an actor that\nAnd then fattening or if they begin to help people um it didn't have any worried about provoking violence um you know to the point where we don't do anything ...\nBecause we truly are the silent majority we're not out there showing it I mean I've been to rally but um it hasn't really scared and worried because you know living my day each day\nI totally understandable you you mean you need your your your support for Trump is not a way for him but you don't\nYou don't feel safe\nPublicly demonstrating that are showing of is that basically right\nCorrect couldn't I don't blame you a bit\nYounger who worry me is if you said you were thinking about dropping support for Trump just the ...\nOh no [laughter] no no no I did it worries me when I'm\nI get a lot of people are worried about this and I'll tell you I think you I think there are a lot of people like you who just don't want to call attention to themselves 'cause this is an insane group of people and they're showing a willingness to assault and intimidating attack anybody and you're right to think that violence is just around the corner\nAnd who wants to bring that on so your point is that there are a lot of people like you who are going to vote but white Trump would want them to vote for him I ... for Republicans coming up in this election that nobody maybe counting\nYes um you know nobody attack on science and they aren't they everybody I talked to is a hundred percent man and that was ... and now they talk about it and it's almost like you know we ... about it like ooh I or you have a ... oh\nYes it's out in the old in the old Soviet Union people would go to the bathrooms in their house to whisper to each other what they really thought because they were afraid that the state if the regime was listening to them and so you're basically this driving describing the same\nThing the difference is that in in twenty six team there were Trump yard signs everywhere you went in states across this country they're not there now without Trump isn't on the ballot leaders\nSo you you might not be all that many Trump signs to be put in yards but but your point is the\nOutward support for Donald Trump is is being suppressed by people to not all pension themselves right\nWhile you're concerned about violence to share it let it grabs soundbite number nine listen to this ... this is Rand Paul it was on Fox and friends today\nAnd uh a mostly easily Earhart\nUh so you have a big fear about this rhetoric your fear is that somebody's going to get killed\nSomeone almost did I was there at the ball field when Stevens police almost died\nFrom a very very angry violent man who is inside and really by rhetoric on the left and this hasn't been reported enough when he came onto the field with a semi automatic weapon firing probably close to two hundred shots at us shooting five people in almost ... he was yelling [noise] this is for health care\nHe also had a list of conservative legislators Republicans in his pocket\nBut he was willing to kill so what happens when Democrats said get up in their face they need to realize that there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence there is going to be an assassination if this doesn't ratchet down and I think the other side needs to really calling the rhetoric down\nPretty much what you're saying you're afraid of violence being visited on you and here's Rand Paul fearing that an assassination is going to say when the Democrats are not going to call their people back the Democrats are not going to ask them to calm down I think some Democrats themselves are afraid of these people\n\nBut privately I think the Democrats are encouraging this privately I think the Democratic party wants America to think that this in unhinged behavior is\nPretty natural pretty normal that it is representative\nOf of a majority of American people like him Democrats want that perception out there they want the anger and the un has behavior justified on the basis that Trump is somewhat acceptable Trump is so bad so dangerous so six or whatever\nAnd there's a lot of reasons they're not going to tamp down there's a lot of reasons they're not going to distance themselves from it and there's a lot of reasons why they're not going to ask these people to back off a little it'd be more responsible\nThey don't think it would help them\nThey think this kind of on the ...

that out in the air if they haven't already I'm sure this tornado watches up now I'm just trying to look at the forecast map going forward to tomorrow and on into friday\nYeah All right now I Want to just go through this very very slowly it's about thirty miles inland now as it is that pounded hard the the panhandle of Florida and it's now moving northeast\nAnd as it moves north east is going to first hit Macon Georgia hundred hundred and twenty mile an hour winds possible for their uh through a\nHundred mile a hundred two hundred and twenty southwest Georgia making eighty two hundred and\n... then then making its way through Augusta and then it'll go up the the north east coast or to the Carolinas I guess through the tip Columbia through uh the rest of the coastal South Carolina area and then into North Carolina\nRight and there'll be near Elizabeth City two AM in the morning on friday and then about a hundred miles east and north in the morning or seven AM eight AM and then on out to sea and a glancing blow a a you know ... like a nor'easter for three to six maybe eight hours\nOr New Jersey on in the southeast New England out of this\nAnd this was the last this is the last one short so you don't have to\nWorry I didn't know was the last one that fascinates me that you said it's the last one this isn't going to happen for the rest of the year\nWhile we knew back in September that we're going to have one come up out of the Caribbean because it's the overall patterns and I'll tell you what folks if we've been in the sense is two thousand and two all over again except literally\nLowly which was the big hurricane and the Gulf hit a little bit earlier and Louisiana and October but we had all the warm weather in September and October this is pointing the way believe it or not\nThis is the pattern recognition toward the winter season which I think it's going to be a big winter for much of the United states this year ... there's certain types of patterns is set up so it's going to get much much cooler across the eastern part of the United states in the wake of this storm\nThat will then establish it we may see something that tries to develop but stay or most likely stay offshore before it's all said and done but impacts dorms on the United states\nThis is the last one in my opinion\nJob of starting you're hoping to save people's lives and uh you help everyday you nailed this with the exact pinpoint perfection an accuracy which is so vital for the people that make proper decisions about whether to stay or go Oh thank you for being with us we really appreciate will go back to you later Oh thank you for having me showing\nAll right eight hundred nine pool when Sean if you want to be a part of the program there was a really disturbing piece on\nThe law and crime website it's Dan Abrams website That's a sister Web sites of media hype and\nIt chronicles the FBI Director who's testifying today on Capitol Hill and he was asked by Senator Rand Paul whether President Trump was still being wiretapped by any government intelligence agency now you would think the answer is Oh absolutely not\nThat's not the answer his answer was not exactly reassuring\nNow the FBI Director Chris Wray declined to actually answer that question as to whether or not the FBI the national Security Agency is currently collecting phone conversations with President Trump\nAnd during a Senate committee hearing on national security issues Senator Paul asked do you think it's possible that the president's conversations with international leaders remember when he was first in office they were leaking conversations with the president of Mexico the prime minister of Australia I mean that's never happened before\nAnyway was asking whether it was possible to ... the president's conversations with international leaders are\nYou know in the foreign intelligence surveillance a Surveillance Act database and raise response was well I'm not sure there's anything I can speak to in this Saturday\nWell then Senator Paul continued do you think it's possible that Congress members of Congress or in the ... is a database of we talked to international leaders\nAnd then re deflected again is that one senator I'm quite confident that we're conducting ourselves in a manner consistent with the law in the constitution a that's a subject to extensive oversight\nI don't know that I can speak to every hypothetical about whether there have been such situations and then Rand Paul as director re whether journalists conversations were being possibly scooped up\nBy the intelligence communities vast spying apparatus simply because they write stories about people with\nSay a terrorist name in them and re declined the answer again I Can't speak to specific hypothetical\nOr that point Rand Paul cut the FBI Director often said the answer is yes\nAnd as this time with right was drawing to a close he spoke about the potential abuse within the ... the system and Rand Paul is absolutely right he said you've had people bringing their politics to work the concern of us who want more control over what you do and\nHow you look at data is as James Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's why we asked you to get a warrant the information you gathered in foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that had gathered\nWith no bar there is no war it there's no constitutional matter to that data\nAnd yet you're going to use it\nOn a domestic crime that has been our complained for years and years and years and I got to admit\nAfter nine eleven I thought it was a great idea\nNever having any any belief that it was possible as naive as I guess I was that we would have government officials at the top upper echelons within the intel community the FBI and the de OJ that would\nLiterally be weaponized seeing the powerful tools of intelligence that we give them to protect we the people that I never in my lifetime thought that a political candidate him put together a flimsy dusty a\nWith Russian sources and it becomes the basis for Pfizer Warren application but not one for\nThe original application in three subsequent applications and that the bulk of the information was bought and paid for by one political candidate to use against another candidate and that it was never verified that corroborate but still present it to a ... court and they purposely don't tell the ... the court judges\nThat the other candidate paid for this and that they never verified it my swearing you know we'll get into this you know with chairman Mark Meadows the Freedom Caucus and Jim Jordan later I mean think about that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Kachina
