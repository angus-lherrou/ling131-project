Juanita\nGetting all\nSo Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as the travel and and you know as a professional opportunity and people move to rouse while all the time but this is that time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what do you do if if\nIf Ross was kind of Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of\nAliens and invading armies and all of that if if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] um let people go out to grade are with your own local farm and ranch community about seven miles out of town where they participate in the cornerstone aren't that great

they come down and I know that that carrier various something where that rants\nThey feel that they become one or they may come down and uh you know it's just that that theory if there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with an especially around Halloween and during the UFO festival in July\n... so I I I'll be traveling through ... I'm I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to\nA new position will be teaching it to Kansas State and my my older my younger son and I was always wanted to go to Roswell right so we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way to dip into the Roswell before we come back up again\nAnd it seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there if anybody were interested in being able to\nGo to the crash site or ... or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the crushing Roswell where what can they do\nBecause they can go to the rival on international year for me in and Research Center which um is a great opportunity to really dive into their circle and the research a part of the crash I'm definitely what check out the library for those who are really the sneakers and do you believe\nA in a different now that we have a U.S a tour of that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first for over Twenty years and he will take\nYou to the exact location of the timing\nOf the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival\nBut the first time last year that broke or families where the crash occurred allegedly they will take you out to the crash site where a Mac rebels rent a house is still kind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land\nAnd so those are just a couple of things that I Would definitely recommend that people checked out and um you know search for victory and so\nOkay so plenty to use the word allegedly in there which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened to you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are kind of on the phone and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nOr we know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the year for a museum or the locals know who the tourists are because\nOf that stature and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that wind which is a great story I bring your ... take pictures stop in the rock a visitor center we have to amazing alien that we'd decorate\nOur economy especially now for Halloween\n[laughter] and put on a big fall festival with\nOur police officers and things like that for the community that on these they're about six foot alien or not people like to take pictures with and and you'll hear the story of you know are employers him on his name is ... and ... and uh you know people really come here searching for the truth\nAnd with local we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you're very very\nWell that'd be great thank you appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in roads well for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nAnd so our population has doubled in size where we're at town about forty thousand and especially on the big anniversary of the festival um you know we've hit close to doubling our size on average per year for tourism we hear a little over two hundred and thirty thousand\nVisitors at a UFO museum and Research Center\nHurting good pretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts a until all of bringing our next guest next but thank you want to you know and if I'm if I'm driving through time and get a chance to say hello okay\nYes pleased there thank you\nHoney the Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism public affairs in a ... New Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a J W let me just tell you very funny book you resist great sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic inside\nOn a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to the second this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary plays in the timeline of American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts\nThey do about a quarter of a million people to come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\nYeah that's about right or the city of about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people I'm I'm In the course of the month it's it's in a quarter million so the massive amount of people for the small city to have that its borders\nWell I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of bugs it's a deep drilled down on\nLike a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked Halloween in shape the subject so it should have you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about a on the popular opinion and how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and it you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\nUm that that there are other places around the world outside of Salem\nThat had massive\nHanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that federal isn't the first ever which trial wasn't the last one that was shot and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for them you know there are\nYou know the first for trout America you're a victim was in Connecticut and in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep them alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nIt is that the honestly it's really a problem today even in ... and I'm also developed countries are still winter if people are being asked for being with us but the the the strange thing about that to me of course is that all of the planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's Salem, Massachusetts\nIt was just incredible feeling said I never felt such a ... round my heart when I have the auditor and two and a half months later\nSomething amazing which will taste why my hot actually contract almost staggering about this one is taking a chick comes back to pull off on soft cookie kind of like a mighty results coming for\nLike a ton of Eric ... excuse the pun ...\nNetworks beautifully owner Richard astro here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system says he'll this gentleman's hot perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies fiercest powers to he'll visit\nC. A. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com or call one eight\nSix six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five their retirement road\nMap show with ... we can't just nine AM Ninety seven point was the big talker [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo er Jay W ... author of a season with the which I just had to look at some of those steps that we had mentioned more vaguely two thousand eleven Largo Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt lincolnshire England\nOr long ago turned its ... incident in which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw\nIn Sweden there's which memorial to the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in the late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some of them and not even all that happened\nIn America but at Salem that sticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery to the even that for the big question that go on the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing [laughter]\nYeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it is about a dozen other reasons why I kinda Salem grabbed onto that monitor and kind of held on to it you know over the course about two centuries\nAnd it's kind of a you know it's a moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that's not usually what a town holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy real killer the famous worlds exposition right you don't know these don't go on their way to put up signs and go it happened here folks\n[laughter] right through it I think to to fight for that one is that you know the tragedy in Salem itself\nWas basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was the ... part of the trial right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course generation around filmed actual the actual stereo started next door in what's now Denver's was at the time to film village so sale itself does only have a kind of\nKind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the proceedings um\nAnd then on top of that today which city means way more than just a victim of a trial I mean the actual which is I live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween and ... than it was kind of become Halloween count as well so it's a deterrent which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today in twenty Eighteen\nYeah I guess ... and this is important in a ... this is great distinction\nCan't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims of murder hey were executed and they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that feeling of kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy the kind of underneath the underneath there for more so to speak on the part of it that's left connected to the tragedy with more just around\nYou know the identity and all these other kind of thing just become and and twenty thing\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute pandemonium as he is so they\nCelebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they thought it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and then October thirty first um but really but over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year do you want to sound Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowd with a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of thing\nOr any other time of the year do you want to visit sounded Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowds it's a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras beads\nIt is it really is um I could talk again hundred thousand people packed to the small downtime with the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know\nFive or six blocks and you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes the freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again my girls are good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans Mardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\nUm but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same ... did you get in Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol in consumed during this celebration\nOh definitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that you know cuts\nThat many of them right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween right boots as a part of it like this is within the party\nOkay so you you mentioned haunted happening but I mean it's the little known for being hunted either ... or there were a lot of haunted houses were were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original ceiling trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that is it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims you have monsters because of the Senate most trials didn't just involved which is\nIn the story involves demons and m's than shaped sisters and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass so you have all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history we're up three hundred and Thirty years of history\nSo that is just you know a lot of people over the centuries so yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening and say on the um the ghost tours their spooky places there's the other five executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky pathology around the city\nNow you've been here most of these I should say you've been there you go there so oh yeah all the time out there are two weekends ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but that's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders and all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest in that as more of the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest as more just in the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me\nYeah let's let's the best what's the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you've captured well you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the one of the really creepy ones is one of the Boston trainer victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real\nYou know real actual snorkel event that then I can reverberate and have kind of thought around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape from the jails there so all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know macabre kind of\nEvents happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trials all that kinda stuff kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of a of a mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm ... ... was there an attempt to for him to do like ... or something while he was there\nNo no he was the uh the building actually still stands it's it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was real police that station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do when he was in town a performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know\nEscape as a PR move for his next big event so that he wasn't down there doing all of a say on busing but if you're doing is a is a scape escape retain\nLike ... ... you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were

I did um\nUh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I got married and boxes wrangler case and publish some very about it which may be right or wrong who knows\n[laughter] well I Love that I Believe that I may revisited that 'cause I've always been very interested in as well but the man from the train is a story it speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once and ruled the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said is is there any story too\nOld to be told a ... when it comes\nAnd I asked her once I said it is there any story too old to be told a news when it comes to you know retailing a story about a murder and she said absolutely not\nShe said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said which which best is it's actually\nYou is the author can bring something new to the store you if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one now did either been\nIncorrectly adjudicated which we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it but also it's true all the time that that there'll be there'll be somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed\nJust isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody is connecting them yet but in in one at least in one case\nA ... a ... a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up\nBeing killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now with these totally innocent\nThey write their their trip while they're there for people who were actually lovely executed for crimes that may have been committed by the man from the train took them\nI Would go so far as to say I'm fairly certain the crime was committed by the man from the train by the local person was executed nonetheless the or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure the uh\nUh but there were also nine people nine black people who were murdered by Lynch mob who uh when I was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by Matt from the track\nWhat year did the murders start first with an Eighteen Ninety eight\nThe last that we are pretty sure that was him like Nineteen quote all although there was a ... there's an interesting crime ten years later that has his ear marks but we can't say that it sounds\nSo I looked in the [noise] I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... or ... Illinois they suck the town where I'm\nHome alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the home alone house um and the mayor\nIn around the turn of the century in the neck and one of the first mayors of the town I'm was murdered alone with his wife in their home in a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right yeah and\nIt was a story I'd always been told by my mother because um she was kind of into the sort of thing where I get it and and ... the the belief was always it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them\nUm but when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the chart of demand from the train\nThe it it is possible we have we assumed that we did not find every crime that he committed we just we found those\nUh which there were enough signature ah ... signature characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that there's this is him but they they\nMay well committed and probably did commit other crimes that are we just did not have enough information about it but that's that's a new and actually I I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear about Ken scratching 'cause I'm writing down\n[laughter] when I heard about a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually find out something this afternoon on it I couldn't um and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody but it made me think about\nIt and so if I got something wrong you know forgive me but it's worth a a a poke anyway so how many people do we think were murdered along America's railroad tracks by single perpetrator\nDemand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason or ... you know during this period\n[noise] well what Rachel I did was we put the murders and buckets\nRight there's a hundred percent ... that that is crimes were certainly\nHave a Seventy percent bucket or forty percent bucket American percent bucket right and I'm ... total up the numbers of murders and each pocket and multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that ah\nIt was our our criminal\nAnd the murder of the tower came up with as a hundred and one that actually include the two people who were murdered who were executed by the state\nA lot for crimes they committed and the the uh somewhere between four and nine people who were who were murdered by Lynch mob for crimes that he either did commit or it may have committed\nSome terms of the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible including the executions as murders because they were innocent um do we say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims\nHis guy who cooks right All right so ... tickets through a typical crime as you as you see the pattern developing in the late ... uh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy's him oh\nWell this is along this could be a long answer I'm not along with a person could be a long trip because there are a lot of things the tie them together the crimes happened near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight\nA family is murder most often a family including how young girl is murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they live usually in a small ... at a town too small to have a police department\nThey live near the intersection of two railroad tracks the I'm a very often bodies are moved\nTheir killed with an axe reacts is found in the in the yard of the victims are on the art of a neighbor and they act as a ban them at the scene of the crime the handlers\nWashed her fingerprints the house is locked up tight all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with blankets so that you can't see it all the doors are all walk the or or something\nThis killer or the one from this morning but just because there's a lot of doubles and running around these days including son devils getting big win to have the kind of fun a show or the we were just hated the interrupt you because you were doing such a great job with the\nExplanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I I had to cut you off because we have the heartbreaking but really it was\nGraduated or up to that because I was going to run out of things to say but I was able to find out of\nTouch severed because that's like a little bit but yeah there\nFor them earthen part that\nI should like thirty four of them aren't there or something or\nSomething like that they um they are the crime you normally heard on Sunday night so you're the hurt on the weekends up until Nineteen pan the crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was blogging or one of the primary understood was logging\nThe or doors or doors and windows ... shot I think I mentioned that they um\n[noise] there's all the clarity of graphic patterns and the murders if wind occurs just south of Portland them extra curse just north of Portland or so that that would be a a link between them they uh\nUh one thing that is odd is that he would he would take a lap from inside the house term they way way down low so that you just gave up a little bit of light take the chairman a awful laugh on set it on the floor usually under a table\nA and then carry the lap around with him as he committed murders and the other thing is that he would uh put poet blankets over the head of a free in person or a half a second before you had with an axe are you there are a lot and they probably did that to\nKeep the blood from flying back and hitting hitting him as he was ordering someone there are quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nYeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along logging lines that actually would be consistent with where this murder happened it's not that the\nTown that I grew up in his logging town but he was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA new and that was plenty of logging was going on I'm In in Wisconsin and it was it was insane for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely could have could have followed the poet or another\nThing I forgot to mention there are all in warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that he very may have ... whether it's first crime which was just an outburst of anger and not\nAnd not a plan that that probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through a cold weather and after that he'd never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\nUm we're talking about the Americans most elusive serial killer\nAnd Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for that dubious crown\n... yeah it it probably might be but I had this discussion with my with my\nPublisher which I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder in American history or the first or something murder is by its nature done in secret or the ... that in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is a killing on it secret\nThere because it is done in in secret the facts about it I never\nFully known and are not ah not normally are fully exposed and um you get a lot of different people who claimed to be\nThe worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that disgusting titled than the this person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just can't document all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody\nYeah I mean it's fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely nobody would ever know about it and they ... they could have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without homes much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims right or John Wayne gay see using runaways and other things that that helped him to elude capture for so long so\nBut the demand from the train is is he is he's called\n... and we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you'd be discovered about this in terms of solving the climate a little bit later on almost don't want to 'cause I don't want to ruin them so close to you know finishing I was reading all afternoon your easily but then there's a couple of good football games I got distracted at dinner so the ... but\nThis guy he nobody it it it it would be president isn't for us to just assume\nThat there was some national awareness of the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a home near train tracks now because there is a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out\nAbout killers along trains during this killing spree\nLove of Eighteen Ninety eight and nine eleven nothing at all the ... and that this has to do with the organization of the wire services at that time in Eighteen Ninety eight and wire services were in a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little\nUh ... this tires have little ability to spread from town to town by Nineteen twelve of the national wire services were were organized a story that was printed in a small town somewhere\nFrom town to town by Nineteen twelve of the national wire services were\nWere organized at a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years\nIn October of Nineteen eleven and all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening so when they went to his most famous crime below Scott Iowa in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is him and this is the latest crime in this\nTerrible series that's been going on but for the first\nMore than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even aware and logically they should have that even though you look at the crimes that there's a case in Virginia West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart the er er and\nAnd towns that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies and you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states in all the rest of the year you would think\nThat people would connect the dots but they didn't the first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man how little who was later executed for and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate events\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speak to\nThe lack of said the development didn't the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also it speaks to the engine seat of\nThe jurisdiction of sharing a police departments and sheriff's departments and there was no national or investigative a body like the FBI yet so there was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true and that introduces us also into one of the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime for a long time ... I'm [laughter]\nI thought I was fairly knowledgeable about it I was astonished to to realize how backward and ineffective address additional system was just a hundred years ago it's beyond belief how\nPrimitive the investigative\nProcess war at the time of the crimes and what the man from the train did was to\nExploit the peculiar weaknesses of the of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture the uh he knew that if he committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered there was no no way really to\nTo connect it to him and he knew that if he committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it but if you committed a crime in a small town that had no police force first\nOf all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him\nAnd syringe ink medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean there's ... ... and ... this was a ... and then ...

their eight dead bodies in the house and it might log house in a small quiet\nMid western town the um [noise] uh and all of them hit in the head with an axe the access found as it usually is next to the body of a little girl\nThe man from the train was a it was a pervert than he was interested in little little girls and that that little girl was usually found in a in an attitude suggests\nRobert and he was interested in little little girls and the little girl was usually found in\nA in an attitude suggesting that she had been\nA she had been outraged after that they um [noise] uh\nIn any case the crime was not there was a great uproar as you can imagine what the crime was not solved\nA two years later a con man named Jay and walk her son came to Alaska and realized that he could sustain a phony investigation of the crime\nBy keeping people angry he could keep donations coming in by keeping people angry or ... and he did that by accusing or a very prominent local citizen Frank Jones\nOf finance or the crimes there isn't any chance in the world the Frank Jones was guilty or that he had in any any connection to it but this campaign to prosecute Frank drones divided pulled us or\nIn a horrible and unprecedented way\nThe city fought over whether or not Jones did or didn't do it for several years uh and became a K better badly divided community you know families on one side of the line wouldn't play with\nFamilies on the other side of the line they wouldn't go that they wouldn't shop at their stores they wouldn't uh wouldn't have anything to do with them as this battle lasted in Alaska\nFor even though a Walker said it was actually run out of town in Nineteen Seventeen the uh um the battle went on for a long time and the hard feelings emanating from it\nOr persisted in the city I Would I Would say for two at the extent that they are supposed to the present day\n[noise] you know you mentioned the piece about the the person whipping up sentiment in making a false accusation to profit from it\nAnd even that creates a pattern for\nAll too often how um crime stories unsolved crimes stories are treated\nYet yeah it's the same time it it speaks to the fact that there weren't cold case police officers working the the crime still the crimes have been at that time might have been solved by\nAfter that period of time by somebody writing a letter confessing simply knowing somebody but but it wasn't it live to almost literally like fall in their lap which again comes back to the the power of storytelling\nAnd how ... just by keeping like telling a story to beginning middle and end all of these events it doesn't matter how old the story is is that it it will get people to listen again into reconsider again and most likely to connect again to that sense of outrage\nAbout what had happened and so you know a static police report won't necessarily you know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah yeah that's right\nAnd and and they do that but also keeps kind of the idea of the murder alive\nIt it makes it it gives you a sensation again it is it that is you know the core of sensationalism but it does it make it make you feel it again the fact that this crime in happened ... had they had they built it you know any kind of memorial to the family had there been\nAny had there been what had the town done to try to come to grips with the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this comment coming to town there afterwards\nThe I'm a ... well there was I don't know if\nThere was that type of sound about I don't know that anyone build a memorial to them I I'm for many years the whole list or\nAuthority that I Would say that still true today the ... the the chamber of commerce tribes pipes and let's go wish the village was known for something else right right the er at ... there is a house for the crime occurred\nIs still standing of his operated as a kind of of more tourism or it's the it's a shows up on paranormal ... TV shows\nAnd people pay to take tours of the house\nThe I'm a ... if you drive around ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now that we at science thing where the doctors houses but that but uh whether\nWhat let's 'cause knowing for is not mentioned anywhere the um uh that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial right yeah uh I don't know that\nYou raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a proper memorial to the victims victims were mostly poor people\nPeople without a without one and the more family was very well why they are and the community\nUh thought well all of them and the vigorous efforts to solve the crime wore a kind of memorial to them uh but I don't think there was any physical memorial to\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers ... where there's an effort to try to so it doesn't need to be like a statue\nBut it's interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics peace not explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of down is not a you know\nThe um the one of his rather than maps of trades crimes with the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder two families in one night an adjoining how the uh uh but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell yeah oh that's a house right\nThere um but it still has not forgotten or many places so many places\nMore stimulating talk Ninety seven point one the big doctor [noise]\n[noise]\nBill James the co author of the men from the train to research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy genes and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it just said that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so so I guess in a room\nUm but you should be very proud of the work to you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing or you looked at these are you looked at these murders\nAnd you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which\nShould also really inform us as to how many unsolved murders were going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomena but it's certainly isn't right\nRight well the the murder of an entire family and one of that is a is a rare of that it was then and it is now but uh uh there were many many unsolved murders in that era\nYou know I mean does even as you mentioned they just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't the investigation wouldn't last for long is it wasn't a lot of funding but Joe is let's let's let's go down this path\nOf of the process that you used to try to actually\nNarrowed down to a name to a person\nI've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper for example is an including going through ships registries and finding whether or not there was a particular sailor\nThat coincided with the murders and white chapel and or other parts of the world\nThat shared similar characteristics as the the crimes in in England but it happened in Central America or happened in in ...\nAnd so they were able to try to find you know well this sailor went from this poor to that port and in each one of these ports there was a murder so it's it into it but if you have to have to START I mean it's quite a needle in a haystack but it's\nIt's at least maybe um\nYou know to to look at it broadly you're you're you don't even know yet what you don't know when you start doing the search like this so you you don't\nYou know is it even possible that a name could even be found given the scarcity of information about you know people are public registries during that period\n... intervention but Jack the ripper case I Am I read I have read probably twenty bucks saying\nJak the river was this guy or jak forever was that guy or jak there and I and my other book popular crime I made fun of the people who wrote those books um the uh uh because I don't\nI don't have much confidence that you can actually do that and to be Frank almost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are selling the um I never really expected that we would find it convincing argument\nAbout who this who was doing this so I mean\nWere looking gas and Rachel says she did expect to find them but I didn't the um uh but when we walk the crimes backward\nA there is a crime in Massachusetts and Eighteen Ninety eight that Rachel says the moment she saw it she knew it with him the um uh and that was because I had told her that this guy wouldn't make mistakes and in his first crime he did make\nNumerous mistakes that let everybody know who he was the uh uh but the number of details that match up in the first crime to let's say Alaska is is just it's beyond anything that you would\nThat you would a suspect was a could be coincidence and I'll I'll mentioned just a few\nThings yeah please do you want me to give me the name or not it doesn't\nMatter you know we will they'll let you go through the coincidence or go through the the similarities first\nWell ... the first crimes that were\nSort of publicly link where crimes in the Portland area and two crimes and the Portland area we're we're committed rather obviously by the same man and the the tech the same detectives happen to be investigating them thought this is the same guy maybe that crime a month ago down\nSouth for the uh uh\nThat criminal had size six feet\nThe um ... another crime in Maine in Nineteen oh two in which the criminals\nThere were there were a pair of boots crafts that were central to the trial or against size six feet this is ... uh the the so we we know that this was a small man well it is recorded about man that we found that he did in fact have size six feet\nNot speculation he did\nWe know that we ... it was believed that he was small because\nI'm the or a ... and and other places when he swung the acts the ceiling with very low the ceiling is only about seven feet high in the room where the murders were committed but when he swung the axe over his\nHead he just barely grazed the ceiling [laughter] if a\nOf normal sized person of a ... a person or large man could not swinging acts over his head in that room without sticking it in the ceiling because of that it was believed that he had to be small it was five foot for the uh uh it was\nThat it was believed that he had to be small it was five foot for the uh uh it was suspected if\nYou look at the blood pattern the way the blood flies off the ax you could say clearly whether it's the guy is basically left handed or basically right handed that's a pretty easy thing to see it was believed that the murder and Alaska was left handed\nThe man who committed the crime and Eighteen Ninety eight was left handed we had said that he had to be\nA well the first stories about him say that he was an experience trap that he would travel around the nation on trains for a while and then he would settled down into an area [noise]\nHad said that he must work as a longer because all the crimes\nFor about ten years occur and logging areas the first story about him or her stories about him specifically say that he was an experience longer the ah ah the nature of the crime itself the special attention to the\nA creepy ... girl a that was there and the first crime in the first cry he always kill them out of the house first and the a and ended with a burger of a young girl that's what he did and first crime\nThe he always used the one side of the X. oh you'd never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say he never killed anyone with a shops I backs but it was always his intention to use the blunt side of the acts\nAnd the spurs crime blood side of the acts and as he would do in Alaska and many other places he left the acts on the floor beside the young girls that the uh so the crime just matches up on\nToo many points for you to think that this isn't him\nSo then she started to look for a five foot four left handed pedophile Nicholas ... longer axe murderer\nI'm ... ... ...\n... how did you begin to narrowly name out of that\nThe when he committed first crime he it was obviously ... who could when it first crime is obvious who had committed this because he was living with the family which that's a common thing or a cereal murders first crime he often kills people to home and he is directly connected and\nCan be tied so we kill the first family and Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew who who have done it because he fled the scene and I was so they were looking for is just that all of these other facts about the first about the criminal happened to line up with what we were looking for\nAnd the name that you believe is a ... ... demand on the train\nThe ... the name that he was using there was all Miller\nThe weather that we watch it and it was a German immigrant the or whether that was his actual name or not um this is speculation he could have been using a false maybe even that however there's no real reason to believe he was\nWe've found that I shouldn't say we found a friend of mine doing research on his own after the book was published\nFound a the the ships record in which you entered the country about in Eighteen Ninety the um are are probably a man named Paul Miller had entered the country I'm On a ... he was he walked with a sailors gate he you know if it was like it and\nThen walk side to side

S. survey dial eight seven seven holy host numerically that's eight seven seven for six five nine for six seven and we'll get your your your calls in just a bit here did you know you were a pagan\n\nAnd the reason why I wanted you to think this way is because of course Halloween being tomorrow\nIt always around this time start stirring up questions about uh you know the origins of Halloween and should Christians participate are there things that Christians should not participate in in life yeah sure there are a Christian liberty is far and wide\nAnd the individual Christian has to use you just have to use your discernment\nTo know what's going to be beneficial what's good what's glorifying God all of those things should be thought about but to throw something out or to say that it has no value when if you dressed it slightly different\nIt would be fine that really you're dealing with the origin of something that doesn't even exist anymore\n\nSo the roots of Halloween yes are found in paganism but that doesn't necessarily mean because ah Sal when was this this Celtic festival was celebrated at one point and it morphed into all saints day in all saints day a morphine or to the day before\nBeing all Hallows eve and that morphed into Halloween and then over the centuries and centuries and centuries this once religious\nFestival just became commercial and secular and at that\nPoint the activities can be fun or entertaining you as the parents should control of the things that your kids are doing or what they're they're how they're dressing or what things they're taking in but that every day in every way and everything\n\nSo the kids aren't thinking of the logically there are not Satan is running around everywhere because kids grew up\nParticipating Halloween\nAnd to understand from a child's point of view that it's just dress up make believe being out at night you know holding the hand of your parents and walking around that the neighborhood at night and the uniqueness of the experience and not all the previous\n\nPagan rituals is important to being a balanced parents didn't understand and a balance Christian and understand how you interact with this world\nYou were in this world for a reason and that that reason really is to glorify God and you find ways glorify God when you break the leaves or do the dishes or do your job\nOr when you celebrate\nThe problem the God of Christianity has would paganism or any other belief system for that matter is not with the general practices of the belief\nNecessarily\nBut the fact they worship another God altogether this is the problem this is where God says I have a problem exodus won three twenty verse three you shell have no other God's before me\nThis is where God's concern is\nThere isn't a command made about you should not dressed up in fun and make believe or you shall not receive sweet ... from the hand of a neighbor or anything like that\n\nOh I'm sure that somebody would like to twist scripture to find something like that but that's not the case\nIt's really about being having a community and experiencing that community\n[noise]\nOn or a or a\n[noise] [noise] oh\nJust pressure will return in a moment to be a part of a show called the cell phone service totally host\nYou probably don't even know how many things already in your life come from pagan origins\n\nWhat you can look down at your a left hand there if you're wearing a wedding ring you're wearing something with origin in paganism in ancient magic\nAnd the concept of the circle as it is seen as this endless and timeless\n\nThing that you can wear and it suggests a kind of repetitive are unbroken time and space and you can see it in many pagan uses a such a Stonehenge\nAnd others that predate Christianity and even in\nChristianity itself there are symbols and practices that come from or were used by pagan the cross itself\nIs a pagan symbol\nAnd wasn't even used very very early on in the Christian Church\nBut you don't think of things that way\nYou don't think that there is an overlap where there's a mingling at all but there is a sure you and your everyday life and even in your faith\n\nIn his Eighteen Seventy eight essay on the development of the Christian doctrine John Henry Newman who was originally a priest in the church of England and later cardinal and the Roman Catholic Church were these words the use of temples and these dedicated to particular saints\nAn ornament id on occasion with branches of trees incense lamps candles holy days and seasons use of calendars for sessions lessons on the fields the ring and marriage all of\nOur all of pagan origin and sanctify by their adoption into the church\n\nSo even across that adorn many churches has taken origins also the beloved fish symbol used by many to identify themselves as Christians whether it's on your clothing or on your car um it was used by pagan generations before Christianity\nThe new age movement Hindus towers Buddhist and others use the symbol of the fish to express their own beliefs different beliefs as well\n\nThe symbol for Virgo the sixth astrological signing the Audi act if you look has a pagan fish in it because of its the direction of the fish people don't always noticed that in the dictionary of symbols that states that Virgo is based on the he break let her mom and the Phoenician symbol meaning fish\n\nSo as you can see you'll you'll have to run very far to try and distance yourself from anything as pagan roots or is associated with religions other than Christianity\nAnd it's not that it's not a noble cause to run away that says resist the death the devil and he shelf way\n\nYou don't need to be running everywhere in fear you have Christ in you and if I Am for you than we are the majority\nNo man can be against you\nSo running away from these things and not understanding that doesn't help anyone and sometimes makes them sexier to younger kids\nAnd more intriguing than it would if you allow them to be the simple secular thing that they are and put your own spin on it however you might want to\nBut how much more important is it that the things and customs in your life or all dedicated the God rather than looking for the devil under every stone\nCelebrations like Halloween can seem on the surface like a contradiction to Christianity I get that it really is more about how it's celebrated then where it came from that matters\nAnd you see this throughout the church there were many things that even our Jewish brothers and sisters dead even the early church did that pagan is dead but they did it to the right God\n\nWhen churches shy away from ... Halloween and opt for\nYou know instead of celebration a of a harvest festival something like that it gives children more of a reason to be curious about why everyone else's celebrating something they are not in maybe even seek out more about paganism than they would otherwise\nAnd and not to mention celebrating the harvest in any way shape or form has pagan origins as well\n\nSo you're sort of changing it but not\nEverything everything\nOh\nSo you're sort of changing it but not everything everything in life can be used for good or evil\nA knife can either kill in the hands of a mugger or ... in the hands of a surgeon\n\nAnd you must remember that how you use it or partake in something and you were intent is important and I know that it that you know it's easier just to cut things out and if that's where you feel led to and God Bless you ...\nThe important thing is just serve God and to ah serve your family in a way that is helping glorifying you gone and if you feel something in your life is not healthy or good or glorifying the garden of course cut it out\nBut sometimes in in removing these things\n... without understanding where the true we come from or or the other things around you and your life\nCome similarly\nYou'll you'll miss the bigger picture and in doing so it's like those surgeries there were a doctor will tell you there that's not a necessary Sergio wouldn't do this because you can go in and mess something else more\n\nWhy not put restrictions on it in a healthy way or you'd be interactive with your children in a way the Halloween can be something dealing with fun and creativity and those types of things and not death in December meant\nIn glorify God because remember first Corinthians ten thirty one above all of this so whatever you eat or drink or whatever you do\nDo it all for the glory of God oh my God\n\n\nPrice shows overture\nTo be a part of a show called the civil service\n\nMessaging deer ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree to further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's o F F E R to seven nine six four or five\nStar to your online MBA information management or business analytics master's program from the W. peak carry school of business at Arizona State university today learn more about the W.

sure some words with you that will be encouraging and lightning and most likely even challenging we haven't been on a journey over the last few weeks or trying to answer the question how do you really live a life of faith what does that look like what does it mean\nAnd I've peripherally believed that the last few weeks have been enlightening to you as far as answering that question and and helping you and everyone else I'm listening to my voice this morning to come to a place of truly living a life of safe\nI Want to pick up where we left off last week when I asked the question how do you measure face how do you measure face\nWell very simply a there was no idea how much faith a person has until the person's face this tested\nYou'll never know how much faith you have until your faith is tested until you were put up against a wall or are you are put into a situation where you have to make moral decisions you have to make ethical decisions you have to do\nEthical things or moral things that that may be a those around you don't or they might be a situation at work and may be a situation with family and friends and maybe a situation\nSomewhere and you have people that are doing something totally contrary to the things have gone are you going to stand up are you going to keep our down are you gonna are you going to go forward are you going to kind of sleep away folks face\nYou'd never really know how much faith somebody has in their life\nUntil they are tested [noise] I think often as Peter\nLord was a one example in in Matthew chapter eight the lord had just been healing a multitude in crowds in common and it was a an incredibly remarkable day in this\nRaised the lord had just been healing multitudes and crowds in common and it was a ... and incredibly remarkable day and the sun was setting and and Peter and the rest of the disciples boys it must have felt great they\nThey must have just been on a real Ohio of God's glory and Albany happen well Jesus came to them and said OK Now let's go in the boat\nAnd let's go to the other side of the lake what Peter's face meter was just was popping it was just explosive it was over the top and and I I'm I'm sure Peter are probably would've said well you guys take the boat I'm going to run around the lake I got so much energy is so much enthusiasm well\nThey got in the boat or to go over to the other side and and and something that I Want to point out there probably isn't talked about a whole lot is that Peter knew more about ...\nAnd the lake than probably just about anybody he would have been raised on a on Galileo he'd been raised there on the lake\nAnd he knew the tides you knew the fish he need the currents he knew the lake inside and out with all of a sudden this man of faith this man of great faith who had just seen thousands touched in fed and ... plus happened\nWas smitten with fear they were on the boat and all of a sudden the sudden storm would come up and that was pretty prevalent for the sea of golly in that\nI've shared this several times during the series and I want to say it again as we uh continue today\nNobody has um shakeup of faith but we do have an unsinkable God\nAnd our faith needs to be in that and shake a book God if we ever want to be an shaking in this uncertain world the only way that will happen is to have faith in unshakable gone\nBecause it is our faith in God that woman able you and I understand it is our faith in God that will enable us to overcome to get through at the end it come over to the side of victory\nAs I've shared already folks are faith will fail unless we believe God is infallible our faith will fail\nUnless we believe God is unfavorable\nI share to I shared about eleven one of Hebrew is where the Bible says now faith is a substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen\nWhat I Love to go down into the six verse of that same passage where it says very clearly without faith it's impossible to please God\nFirst we must come to God and believe that he is and the second thing is we're going to believe that he reward to those who diligently seeking your faith and my faith is not as size issue is not a matter that this man has great faith so that person has little faith\nWe serve the same God and our stand in our trust in our victory in our belief and are overcoming and are a whole has to be in that God and living a life of faith has just that understanding we may only have faith in him\nAnd it may be very small but it's strong it's an shakeup will not because of ourselves we are unshakable but because we know that our God is unshakable\nLadies and gentleman understand it's amazing what a small amount of faith will do when you realize you've got such a big God\nThe Bible tells us that one man plants and another man and waters but God brings the increase\nYou you may be planting your life and Christ will God's gonna bring other people around and water you to help you grow into that that great and foundational a tree for him\nTo do the great things that he wants to do but ... says that that route has to be planted strong and that planting has to be in God it has to be in your relationship with God\nI talked about Paul at the beginning of this particular series and I talked about how the fact is Paul was accredited the writing two thirds of the New Testament\nThink of that two thirds of the New Testament was was panned at the hand of Paul as he stepped out and save them believe God\nWell the Bible tells us to Paul miraculously got said he was on his way to Damascus to a salt and to destroy those who called on the name of the large those who are calling themselves Christians\nWell on his way to Damascus the Bible says that a great light shown from heaven and knocked him off his horse to the ground and all of those around him were startled and\nThe Bible says that he was struck with blindness\nAnd he saw the lord\nThey said Paul Paul why didn't you persecute may and Paul said lord you see Paul understood immediately\nAnd they said Paul Paul why didn't you persecute may and Paul said lord you see Paul understood immediately\nHe was in the presence of God now understand Paul even though he was doing it wrong he was still trying to please God he was still trying to find his place in God\nThat let me take a little segue here folks the reality is there's a lot of religions in the world that are trying to measure up there trying to do works there trying to do missions trips are trying to earn\nTheir salvation when the Bible says that no one comes to the lord except through Jesus Jesus said\nI Am the way I Am the truth I Am alive and no one comes to the father except by me\nIn the book of acts the Bible tells us very clearly that Jesus is the only name given among men whereby we must be said there is no other hope and salvation folks if you're going to a church that doesn't praise the Jesus Christ is God\nAnd that he died on the cross that he rose again the third day he was born of a version and the fact is is he's coming back one day you need to get out of that church as fast as you can if they teach that Jesus is Satan our brothers which there is a very big religion that teaches that\nIf they teach is if they teach that Jesus is a way instead of love way to heaven\nOr a God instead of love God if they don't teach that Jesus is the only hope then you need to get out that church as fast as you can and find a good\nBible preaching church that preaches that Jesus Christ is the only hope for mankind ladies and gentlemen the Bible teaches he was born of a version that he lived a senseless life\nThat he was a mocked and beaten and ridiculed and he was crucified and then on my third day he rose again from the grave and nice and he sits at the right hand of God the father if your church doesn't preach that\nWith how to quit the kitchen with out reservation then you need to find another church\nFolks the Bible tells us that God's word challenges us in order to change us our life has\nTo be changing and it can only change if the foundation is Jesus Christ and him crucified this same Paul when he was asked all kinds of theological and religious questions he told the church's core rent he said I have determined to no nothing among you accept Jesus Christ\nAnd him crucified so let's talk about Paul for just a moment here why did God get Paul out of jail and fill a pie in a matter of hours but left him almost three years in the jail in Rome\nIt it was the same Paul the same faith the same God\nBecause ladies in Yemen understand something it's not only about having faith in our God it is about having God in our faith\nThat any man on earth have more faith than Paul\nReally did it did any of the disciples that any of the uh other followers of Jesus the the ones that are called upon the name of the lord than anyone have more faith than Paul well let me break this down for a moment here we're talking about living a life of faith\nThe simple reason that Paul was only in the church is Philip ... for a few hours is because God had to have Paul out on the road preaching the gospel establishing the church is not this kind of brings in another little side note folks listened to me if you sit out there and say you don't have\nTo go to church to be a Christian I agree with you you don't even get saved it right on this radio a program you can ask Jesus is coming to your heart for ... become your lord and savior and the Bible says according to Romans chapter ten that you would be said if you believe in all your heart\nThat Jesus Christ is God only son that he died on the cross and the gun raised in from the dead you would be said that's what the Bible teaches but let me tell you something more if you think you couldn't remain a Christian without going to church you are grossly deceived and\nThe enemy is not far off for bringing down the Bible says that we need to be joined together oh not with just your little handful the folks that are that are preaching the same thing that happens to be different than God's word\nBut I'm Talking about in a church where you've got tens or hundreds or even thousands the size of the church doesn't matter what you preach in Jesus Christ and him crucified and not a man's philosophy but only gums theology\nYou need to be in church you need to find a good Bible teaching church well\nLet me talk about Paul Paul had to go out preaching the gospel establishing the churches\nThe churches an emphasis the churches didn't fill up by the churches in ... see the church is in a festival and Ike a the churches are in Rome all the different places Paul one place to place to place\nTo build the church to establish the church and the churches\nThat God could do the work not just the house churches folks but the actual churches like the synagogues that were already established we're multitude should come together rejoicing and God well the\nReality when Paul Went to Rome he was established in churches in Rome but in Rome he was arrested\nAnd different than ... pi he's spent almost three years and the Roman jail before he was released [noise] why was that different why didn't happen simply because Paul needed\nTo be in Rome to write the New Testament\nIn Rome he wrote the letters to claw see the books cautions he wrote the letters to Timothy he wrote the letters to Titus he wrote letters to current he wrote the letters to a ... he wrote the letters to ...\nIt never got done and the reason never got done was because to\nDo all the things in that two thousand can master plan would have taken 'em about Seventy million dollars in the county just didn't have it so they never did that and they never tore up the track and so the track still exists it's just been laying there for\n'em all these years and it's pretty well pretty well run down but all of the the structures they're the rails and the\nThe track itself is there just needs some work and the needs are about three or four inches of sand added to it to make it have good footing you know\nFor horses before two thousand and Ninety thousand ten how long the word the horse races are going on there you know what's the history there\nWell that grandstand belonged to the original Arizona down ... down in uh uh Phoenix area and they um trick that grandstand down piece by piece and gave it to I Believe the sheriff's policy here in town [noise]\nAnd um [noise] those guys loaded on trucks and they brought it to Flagstaff and they put it back together and then they constructed attract so I I think ... or ... if you thought\nThey raised continually from from that time on chill it two thousand a night when the the board of supervisors forced to stop it because of financial reasons economic reasons [noise] but anyway um\nI Would really like to get it started again we have several\nFolks here in town that really would like to see it happen again you know they brought back the rodeo a few years after that and in the rodeo committee\nHas been putting on rodeos there for five or six years now and they've been really doing a good job and they they are making money\nEvery year I went last year or earlier this year and that's the profitable venture now right I mean you look at you look at ... you look at ... you look at the rodeo you look at a\nUh how successful this down there obviously and it could be it has been successful here so horse races is there still I'm using that draw to uh to bring the crowds and and you know up here in where else do they do the horse races right now in Arizona is is you know it's just very popular so\nIt is if you know a turf paradise down and Phoenix that's the big of course and they have well they're they've had some record setting I'm dates down there this they just open their racing season I think two weeks ago and they had a record size crowd\nAre also they're doing a races down at the Tucson area you'll read though race track which the retail racetrack was actually the the home of the where they first\nStarted putting on quarter horse races\nThen uh Prescott downs are the only ever pie downs down there in Prescott valley that went bankrupt about the same time while right after the same time in two thousand diners are races that track it it laid vacant there for many many years and and just recently uh\nSeveral fellows from the the Phoenix area in Prescott got together and they formed a group called J. court and they bought that track so they're going to be put in races there\nWell let me ask you this and folks are talking with Coconino county board of supervisors Jim parks okay you get the horse races back if you get the horse races back here in Coconino county um first of all does it pay for itself or is the county or does it county up to ... ... split the money what what's your vision here\nThis is going to have to pay for itself the county can afford to subsidize\nKnow Flagstaff is no longer just a a stop on the road to California Flagstaff is a is becoming a destination\nAnd uh people come here to have fun they come here for ... to come here for for the night life in the in the city of Flagstaff they come here for 'em to get away from the heat this\nWould be an ideal way to get them out of the valley out of that heat with something to do is fun and um you know it was always a great time I remember years ago we used to go to the horse races we'd seen all of our friends and neighbors and\nAnd everybody to be there and it it drew in those days even it grew quite a lot of folks in Phoenix\nSo here here's here's a chance to do not only horse racing but several other things and you know we could have the thoroughbred quarter horse racing we could even have a harness racing\nUm we will have the rodeo we could have high school rodeo we could have\nUm English and in western horse shows and of course we are we still have the ... [noise]\nBut um raining class shows or avian shows professional writing and I would also like to to um look into bringing back the Native American power on rodeo in Hindu headquarters that worked at\nA gym what does it take for this to happen what what what action do you do you have to take or the or the board of supervisors\nI'm Glad you asked here's the deal\nThey are looking at the county board ah parks and recreation department right now is looking at a new master plan they are designing a new master plan right now the ... the a\nComment period will last until the thirty first of this month so there's still time to make comments on it and make make a positive comment about horse racing\nAnd the more positive comments about horse racing horses events that we can get\nAbout the racetrack in in in Grand stands arena area the are the better off we'll be with the construction of the new master plan\nOkay how do they do that in this world where people got to do it with their sons on their phone\nWe're off will be with the construction of the new minister plans\nOkay how do they do that in this world where people got to do it with their songs on their phone [laughter] is there a way to do is ... is it is it that kind of comments or do people have to actually go somewhere\nThey can go to the county to county parks and rec site\nAnd a real quick um uh the the ... sport there in on the site you can actually bring that up a sign up for making a comment maker comments Coconino easy dark go slash form center slash parks\nAnd recreation\nJim I actually put a link I I Will put a link up at talk with Jeff dot com or show folks go there right now\nA talk with Jeff dot com I put a link or that you can go to the county site\nAnd and make those comments will make it easy for for folks are gym so I talked to over thirty first you'd like to see the the horse race come back at that track re done or the demo derby also happens they're a good friend of ... over to him\nI Do I Love they hold a demo derby there um and a lot of folks show up for that every year\nThat's a very popular up there during the labor\nDay and that's when I was very ... to try to bring the

you introduce Stewart Daniel Schorr\nWith Jay Root beer [noise]\nYes I'm Stuart with you know what I'm used to deceive you're glad to\nBe here I previously around of the last election cycle actually during the primary represents one of the house of representatives great experience and\nAll around northern Arizona and you might have seen my billboards and yard signs et cetera all throughout the northern Arizona region and a very active in the community and to look forward to making a positive difference in helping folks out\nIn the region store joined us from is because he does have quite a financial background and you know I bet stored number of years ago as the vice president of the chamber of commerce here in northern Arizona the size of chamber right and you know the thing is you know Stewart you really have a beautiful face for radio so\nI should do to help out\nThe guy that was that the big dig at it is\nFair enough [laughter] but no real super excited at for a financial just doing it on our team and you know he's going to be servicing in working\n[laughter] but no we were super excited ... financial just doing it on our team and you know he's going to be servicing in working with people in the northern Arizona so we have an office here in Flagstaff downtown Flagstaff\nAs well as we have an office in Sedona that services or the tri city area which is you know the ... what camp Verde\nArea a plug bill and so forth right low growth out there in in great opportunity to help even more book\nWell I'm Glad to have you in CDL as well Stewart and I know it's it's Kennedy herding cats today with stuff have you back well people are\nWe just got an honorary today [laughter] they were here you're the roads between two story [laughter] we got a buddy of coffee you know that's why we're ready to you know I dabble\nI got my work cut out for me that you know one of the things we're going to focus on today that we were chatting about a little bit off line\nIs financial wellness and how much having a healthy mind and body really goes hand in hand with having healthy finances that you know what most of us know what to expect when we go in for a checkup on our physical health\nBut we don't know what to expect for a financial check out so that's where I'd like to begin today in garnish how do we get started with that\nWell you know me being a doctor on radio so I think I guess I can talk about financial help [laughter] so\nI've always talked to people about a financial checkup is extremely important and you know you have to have just like you would go get your you\nKnow oil changed on every three thousand miles and it's funny in our industry is that the\nYou know there's a saying in our industry that guys take better care of their vehicles and take care of their health you know and in women live longer because they take better care of their health and so that's kind of the important aspect of what we're doing here and one of the things we found was that\nLike you're supposed to do a physical every year with a doctor in and get a check up and so for doing that on your finances extremely important as well because you know a lot of times you don't realize there was a problem and you're you're too far down the road and\nYou know if there's any kind of corrections or strategy change that has to happen we want to be able to implement and make those changes as soon as necessary\nWe're talking today with the ... owner and founder of our financial group and you weren't McDaniel is here with us as well he's part of the team that for a financial and I'm generally alongside it gives the retirement ... power to pay for a financial group\nIs that when you get in your car and you start driving and the first stop you would say would be you know like going if you're on ice forty you'll be going towards Williams so first off would be Williams then it'd be so women then you'd be Kingman so theoretically when you're looking at this you're not getting to check your tires and things like\nThat until you get to a gas station right and if you need gas that's what you're doing but what happens is if there's a problem in between that distance you're absolutely unaware of\nFour fifty sixty ... even a hundred miles versus what happens in retirement planning\nIs that a lot of times people say you don't you know check a couple of years or you know most of the most of what we've seen is that people have come in and they said you know I had a financial plan done ten years ago mhm and I go and then what and they go ... ...\n... years ago and I think we're on track I I don't know I I go how can you be so sure or are you sure and most people I sit down with they really don't limit their own tracker and uh they just goes you know life is happening\nAnd we have an advisor that's kind of managing our accounts and I think we should be good well most people don't realize is when I first started in this industry\nBack in the early nineties the rate of return or projections that were being used were significantly higher\nThan what we consider using today and I was speaking to another financial advisor in our community\nRealize that they're using a pretty robust rate of return in projections\nOn their portfolio so they always looks like you're going to make so much more money and then you create your spending plan around how much money you think you're going to have\nAn intern you're good to have a significant shortfall because he didn't perform up to that level\nAnd so part of this also is we want to talk about risk management\nYou know if you look back you know this year will use this year as an example I I don't want to go very dated on the timing but if you just look back this year we've had significant volatility in the market\nAnd the recent months uh we've had quite a bit and I think people don't realize if the markets are up or down because you know and sometimes they turn on the TV and it says\nYou know the S. and P. hits new highs are Dow Jones industrial average has hit new high\nAnd they think that they're making all this money but then they don't realize that soon after that the Dow Jones industrial has gone data of five hundred points or something like that you don't\nKnow maybe several thousand points in like in that case\nSo those are the kinds of things that you know when we\nA hundred points or something like that you know or maybe several thousand points in like in that case so those are the kinds of things that you know when we create a plan that's where\nWe're addressing we're really addressing the safety component of your plan so here's the thing if you're going to Los Angeles from here\nAnd the road map you know your Google Drive or whatever you you have any more what do you call them nowadays\nBut over the navigation system navigation ... yeah ... ... you know I I still go back and think about you know like I was thinking about the Rand McNally road\nAtlas writes most of us traveled back it'd be for all this stuff came out you know we have to we actually had to lay it out and make a plan and really understand that\nYou know if you drove respectable speed limit and you know read considering traffic and so forth that you would get to your destination\nIn a certain period of time and that's where people are really losing the focus is that you know too much electronics is in the way too much garbage is going in their heads from watching TV and so forth and everybody's chasing returns what I mean by that is that you\nKnow people are looking to make as much money as possible but they don't realize what the downside stroke up that would be\nRight and if you just kind of go back and look at what happened to two thousand seven two thousand main short here in Tucson at that time 'cause I was younger than you saw you know big cities even worse\nOr absolutely seeing folks there were a hundred percent tied into real estate because at the time you know the real estate market with a booming in the early two thousand ... and things were great into it wasn't the and people lost half of\nTheir their value overnight they couldn't give it away correct right I mean we just saw people were unprepared and and they didn't have that they didn't realize the things aren't going to keep going the same way whether it's up or down and so not panic in enough the whole holistic approach\nBut it also provides opportunities as well you know how to\nWrite so you know I mean you know when we look at the market so we're seeing you know we have big upswing in the market\nAnd then you see big down swinging the market right and then we see\nPanic and we see we do you get to see all kinds of emotions right you know greed fear panic all that stuff right anger and\nYou know we we find is that when people don't have a plan\nThe emotions get the best of\nRight and and bad things you know we we all go through difficulty throughout the day right that doesn't mean the ruined our day\nAnd then that's the whole thing that we have a plan to move forward whatever it might be as we're going out to vacation going on a trip whatever it is now we have a plan to move forward and that and that's how we approach or the financial plans as well and how important that is because without that plan that's when the panic that thing that\nWe've had a bull market for probably a decade at this point and it's been well you know like I mean if you look at the ten years the markets up but you know the volatility that's have come into play has been pretty significant in two thousand eleven you know if you're just at home and one\nFor giggles if you look at the Dow chart in two thousand eleven and you go back and look at two thousand two thousand eight charge it was an exact mimic the markets in the charts for exactly mimicking that instead of going down\nWhat happened was the federal government stepped in and then they get infused much money in the market right and that's what kind of ... the mark it up and it's gone up since the end you know in the long term we see the markets will go up by the fact is that\nIf there was a major market correction\nAnd you know you're retired and you're reliving off this money\nAnd you're taking out say a thousand a couple of thousand maybe three ... three thousand dollars a month out of that account\nAnd your portfolio overnight just got chopped in half because the markets went down right and you're just you know the thing it's a short term volatility and usually you know in in oh seven or eight when the market corrected\nThat was it all happened within six months and that was considered a short term volatility but he was a major market correction and if you know anyone that's retired I'm In their retirement no seven away\nAnd if you're thinking about retirement and you're not really thinking about roasts you should have a conversation with one of these folks that were affected by this and you probably know them and\nWhat happened there was if they were taking money out out of their investment account for the IRA count as it's chopped in half because markets went down\nAnd they took him seven years to get back to where they were but if you're drawing against it\nYou will never recovered that money and there's a great chance that you will run out of money a lot sooner and blunt nice speaking I beat this wrecking ball we always talked about pendulum you know when the market's going one weighs beautiful you know everybody's smiling\nAnd laughing dental and swing fend\nPendulum swings the other one is that it's a wrecking\nBall you know to listen to a portfolio and you know like Stewart was a part of the of mortgage company and you know what was your title and more movies banker or else the mortgage banker ladies first magazine a financial and yeah\nThe company went out of business right behind it and that happened to do a lot of folks I mean companies that were highly leveraged didn't up again plan a for for long term\nIssues and and that's what happened with them and you know and the thing is that most people have to have a significant um analysis that should have the analysis done to understand what kind of risk they can actually afford to take right and\nYou know we we do run into a lot of people say well you know I have bombs from my portfolio that safe\nI don't know how to\nAnswer this question but I always say you know once you call people that own\nThe LA county bonds rents would last more they went bankrupt right or not my area choice right and you know I mean you can go down the line and you know they're in depending on what kind of bond you're buying but you know I mean there's still a significant risk associated with it\nThe other thing we also look at uh when we talk about the risk portion of it\nIs that uh the fed has been talking about they're going to raise the interest rate\nAnd what happens in bonds that most people don't think about they think most people are taught wrong but they are taught that stock market and bond market work against each other meaning\nThat the stocks are up the bombs are going to be down and bonds are up the stocks are going to be down well that is not true\nWhat effects the bond market is the interest rate in the interest rate is going up the bonds are going to go down in value and if you know if the interest rate goes down the bombs go up in the ice if you just mentally see a seesaw\nAnd if you put bombs on one side and you put the interest rate on the other side and if one\nGoes up the other one's going to go down so you just keep that in mind so you know we always talk about creating safe strategies in retirement so if you're listening to the show and I actually have a gift for you\nAnd they have in the right kind of product or to help balance out the risk against the safety the idea nudey would be the safe component that is correct but a lot of times what the advisors are doing is that they have their clients' money in the market\nAnd they sold client a annuity variable annuity just to generate additional revenues for their for their company\nAnd it's a it's a revenue approach it wasn't a holistic approach to planning\nAnd so that's one side of it right so let's talk about the the kind of annuities that we feel good about and we like and those are called fixed annuities\nRight now fixed or nudity is not going to make you rich if you think you're buying a fixed annuity because you're going to end up with a double your money in five years it ain't happening\nRight now I'm looking at a guaranteed right of return and how right that is right in the idea behind that was really used to you know the annuities the fixing ... are designed not to make you rich but it's actually design from keeping you from becoming poor right and so within a fixed uh nudey a family\nThey have one called indexed\nSo it's got fixed indexed annuity and the fix component means that your principal is not going to go down\nAnd index so everybody's heard about index funds would index funds to his mimic the stock market the U.S and the five hundred the Dow Jones industrial average or you could have been asked to actually go to Russell one thousand two thousand three thousand I mean she was going right there's a whole list of things you could index and so forth\nSo these annuities actually\nHave where your rate of return on your fix nudity\nIs linked\nTo the performance of an index and you're not going to make as much money as the index and you'll never make as much money as the index but what happens is that when indices go down\nYour money doesn't go down so if you take say I'm just using it as an example we had a hundred thousand dollars in let's say you make five thousand dollars in interest on that now that hundred and five thousand dollars with the fixed annuity\nBecomes part of your principal meaning it's locked in it doesn't ever go backwards stock market goes down fifty percent guess what you get a big fat zero\nFor returns instill it the one oh five now still at one of five right in the markets come up

fifty five that's Ninety wait just tick tock\nGarnish tell me a little bit a batch risk management how do we know if we have the right amount of risk\nSo for starters you know when we talk about his rule one hundred so some people have heard it and you know we've talked about this on the show in the past but if you took one hundred\nAnd if you subtract your age from that so assuming that let's say somebody sixty years of age writes we subtract sixty from one hundred answers forty and what that means is a forty percent\nOf your investment portfolios should be associated with risk\nAnd sixty percent of your money should be somewhere safe and yeah we talked earlier that you know people have the false sense of security when they own bonds or you know even they own variable annuities that have income riders and things of that nature\nAnd those things I consider those false sense of security because we were looking for is what is your real dollar war not an income writer but real dollar and\nSend this case where we talked about is if you were to take sixty percent of your uh investment or you know sixty percent of your account value and that should be somewhere safe and\nYou know you could put that in CDs money market accounts but what do they pay today do you know\nNow that is well almost nothing nothing right it almost so what happens there is if it even if it paid one percent doesn't matter but the thing is that you're going broke very safely and you don't realize that you're going broke right because your money's not keeping up with inflation so\nUnique your money working to or at least keeps up with inflation that means you're seeing even Stephen but we're we're focusing on is actually growing it a little bit more than that so that you always have the growth factor associated with it especially as your expenses\nGo up you'd actually be you better than in places where I could because as your expense to go up your best hope caustic cetera\nIf most people don't realize but their pension you know people were thinking that far ahead but they you know oh they're so worried about retiring and having enough money when they retire\nThey don't realize that the cost of living adjustments like you were you when you were working and you got to two percent pay increase or three or four whatever or some of the some of you listening gold\nMine for hasn't given me a raise in five years you know because I mean there are some people that just you know aren't\nStructured that way but most most times when people are working their cost of living adjustment as a as their income goes up every single year but what happens in this case is that most pensions\nDo not have it cost of living adjustments so today you know the middle of like we talked about in the past were laughing about um you're on the show but we had talked about you are when I first started driving you know gas prices were like eighty nine cents a gallon and\nI remember that you do write of flew under a hundred dollar hundred dollar right and so by the time I actually graduated high school\nOr the prices have actually gone up over like Donald Thirteen or so and you know you know what I mean today if you look at it it's you know whatever the prize loved to have a kind of gas prices down right [laughter] yeah that'd be fun [laughter] but that was inflation right and\nToday I just just ordinary were just talking to a client of ours\nAnd they ended up buying a new vehicle and I asked him I said would you pay for the vehicle and and they told me the number and I do realize that your parents first house\nWill cost less than what you pay for your vehicle today right and they're like that is so true you know that is so true and so you know we're looking for understanding how the inflation is going to impact\nYou can imagine that we have the right or be to get you there comfortably and affordably blame you forget away today and started with a road trip to affinity RV where you

like to be paid for my mistakes then okay [laughter]\nWell now fall and then the phone rang you might be finding that between all that patio furniture and lawn mowers an outdoor equipment and anything else you've got for the warm weather season you're running a real tight and outside storage shed can be a great solution and also again why project our\nProject but before you began that there are four important things you have to can hitter and we've gotta catch in today's ... project present and I hope that their dot com\nNow first the cost to build a shit is a pretty wide range we're talking about between eight hundred and four grand it depends on a true choosing whether you're going to build yourself or hire a pro but what do you decide to be a white or not there are several basic questions you need to ask you saw before you start shopping\nFirst of all do you need a permanent I think a lot of people first\nOr not there are several basic questions you need to ask you saw before you start shopping\nYeah first of all do you need a permanent I think a lot of people forget and thanks to my house and I can do whatever I Want and I'm going to do the thing I'm going to put up a fan\nYou can't always just go and do that you have to check your local building comes first to determine if you need a permit to build a shot on your property now you don't want to find out after\nYou finished the project that it's got to come down because it violated some building code orange zoning code I mean that's the last thing you want to do in fact a bunch of money and then have to take it all down and then do it again\nNow the other big thing you've got to think about is what five this year ... ban what do you want it to be you know do you need something simple and you know primarily forget to business needs putting nothing then they're not making a cute or any other functions or do you want something decorative\nThere are so many different styles and size is out there that you really need to evaluate your home and your property and how you're going to use that that you can determine the style for what you're going to be\nYeah and part of that as a society where the shit is going to go I mean depending on the size of your property you get a lot of different options for the placement that shit now folks very commonly might put it close to the house which makes running power in ... or\nSometimes folks will tuck it sort of to the side of the back of the property so that it's less obvious but put some thought into that because you're going back and forth a lot and you don't want to regret that decision\nAnd finally what your budget I mean did you get a tight budget you build a very simple should that gets the job done without a lot of frills\nBut it's got some wiggle room you could think about adding some extra features like integrated shelving inside decorative trim on the outside or you could go all out man cave or she's shed and maybe and electricity heat swimming\nWall to wall stereo I don't know you know you can really totally decadent those are fun too but I think it through in mind that budget so that comes out just the way you expect\nNow if you do go pro we recommend getting estimate from at least two or three contractors before you choose the one that's going to help you with the project\nAnd I said from project for them to make money by their dot com with homemade by there you can get matched with top rated homes servants probably in your area we verified review is an appointment on mine all for free\nNo matter the type of job ... fast and easy to hire the best local approach\nNow got cancer Adelphi on the line was looking for a better shot or\nWe have today I'm Hi I'm calling because I wanted to find out um I had an old Victorian house and I had a a three three three\nI had a ... or ... and when it wasn't a shower the second floor and then I'm like a shower or when the water up there on the air for the shower go with coke and I've been ... contractors and my former and I'm not getting dark so I like to remedy that come to our remodeling\nOkay so are you opening up walls is part of remodeling\nYes I Am completely stripped answered it\nOkay great so first of all the reasons you have reduced water pressure an older homes are generally because you have old steel pipes that suffer from internal resting and they clog the closed down ... like a clogged arteries and then you can't push enough water through it\nAnd that could be your main water pipe there could be the supply pipes that are inside the house\nOr a combination of them and so since you're taking the walls are part of the general rule of thumb is whenever you expose these old steel pipes you want to replace them with copper pipes um war with pets was different to a newer type of plumbing pipe now the other thing is you may have enough water pressure coming in from the street\nOne of the pressure is not that big of a deal because I think the pressure on okay it's just like basically we have to bear from going out and you can only use one at a time by the water completely goes ice cold shower somebody comes and eager to think\nWell that's because the the pipes may not be supplying that hot water they may not be moving in the hot water what size warrior do you have um forty hours or less a minimum size but should be okay for for two bathrooms okay then is it an older water heater\nUm now I just ... or to hear\nWhen you replace the changing the plumbing around it this is going through the steel pipes\nThat they changed it around the no I don't think\nYou need to talk with your plumbers about what kind of pipes you have whether or not that's contributing to the problem and need to know where the water pressure is at the street because if you're not getting enough pressure that could be the whole cause of it\nOkay now I go there and I saw something on line called a um a pressure balance that out what that were many issue at all\nSo pressure valve valve is designed to be used primarily in the shower and what it does is it keeps them mixed between hot and cold balance so that you don't get scorching or freezing cold waters when the pressure drops so if somebody wants to say run hot water downstairs and now ... hot water from the upstairs shower [noise]\nIt would not change the balance of water from the mix of water between hot and cold so the flow would be less you'd have less of a stream but it wouldn't be\nThe the temperature wouldn't change okay right okay no that's not as though I don't think that's the cause I mean that would that would certainly be a good thing to have something you should consider but I don't think that's the reason you're not getting hot water on the second floor I just don't become moving enough water up there\nOkay so basically what I Need to do is tell them to check the piping around the water heater again\nA plumber should know this not only to run the water heater with basically if you're going to one of those walls what kind of pipes do you have\nAnd are they corroded and should they be replaced help groups are up to help alleviate this okay I'm In of all else fails you could always had a second water heater upstairs you could get into a checklist water heater which would be a really small unit and it would supply additional water and the second for bathroom\nOkay okay okay well I think that kind of remedy the problem\nAll right thanks so much for calling them money pet Haiti fresh clean water delivered every tapping your home\nSingle subject can

of time between Celtic changes really very big type of cleaning can you have in where it's located\nIn well it's a function of water quality again I mean you know ... years ago we we had this filter that was so good that it would clog up all the time and people hated it\nBut the water was perfectly clean because it was taken every bit out of it so it's this is this balance point between taken out the important stuff but not having to be that you have to change it every month or every every two weeks\nYou know what it is important to change it when needs to be changed because I remember in the Twenty years it's been as a home inspector I'd seen filters that folks put it in with great intentions and then never touched it again for two years and in fact if you do that I guess it could become

starts and stops intermittently I tracked it down to they were the fail\nHum doesn't do it all the time it starts and stops intermittent tracked it down to the were the film is for the water comes in the toilet\nThat what's causing that Carl is the ... valve and it's not an unusual condition the we see that a lot we've heard about it many times\nAnd the reason the habits intermittently is it's somewhat a indicative on the expansion of contraction of those parts and it's going to vary based in the water temperature um but it also was only going to happen when the toilets reselling\nSo what you should do is simply replace the fill it while you're at the flush about because they usually come into sat there not very expensive you can buy both for probably Fifteen bucks\nAnd if you follow the instructions that come with these ... and do it yourself projects to be able to kind of pretty much rebuild your toilet\nOkay sounds good to know if I might point out something um it does it when the water is not running in the house at all sometimes\nRight and here's here's why that's happening okay because you probably have a leaky flush valve it's one of the reasons I said to replace\nA bowl filled and flush valves because if you have a leaky flushed out and get a very slow leak of water out of the bowl the ... valve will respond to that and refill that bowl so you're probably wasting some water because of this condition as well so it's a good thing you founded but again it's an easy inexpensive sex and you can do it yourself\nOkay very good time I appreciate your welcome

sheet rock and we'd like\nTo uh put texture in it but I'd like to do it as simply as possible so she can texture and bank\nAnd I watch more information about that or what you recommend\nIt is possible right Leslie to use an additive in pay but frankly usually get the opposite question most people calls wanting to take the texture away so [laughter] so I Would say send your your really sure you want to do this because once it gets on there it's hard to make it to make it go away\nRight yes I mean our other walls have some texture I mean and that's not a heavy texture it's just a little bit and I can just knocked flat sheet rock\nAnd it's a texture and the painter is an actual texture within the trial itself almost like a ...\nWell I'd rather not go that route as the the the ... um I'd like to add texture to the pain just to give the wall something other than the drywall well\nThere's a couple of different techniques that you can use 'em first there's something called the linen technique that's done with almost like a wallpaper brash sort of a very short\nStiff bereft of all that you know maybe twelve inches to Eighteen Inches wide and you put the paint on and then you should have dragged that brush through and that gives you a linear texture to it and that can kind of look like wallpaper and you can do it with one color or do a base color and let that dry and then\nPut a thinner coat on top and then dragged outlined through um you can do something that's almost called the I guess it is actually called the Venetian plaster\nBut that involves you know sort of marveling the texture on and and furnishing it and rubbing and it really is a heavier coat of paint and plaster but that gives a really interesting sort of\nCloudy textural look that sometimes has a high shine to it um there's this waited texture I think Ralph Lauren is one of the teams that make that and that has um\nIt really does look like sway that has that sort of like Rob Sachs curb not looking texture to it there's a standard finished with there's actual sand in the pain sometimes I can feel a little rough almost like a sand paper\nBut I'm back in the nice texture to they all in different application technique so if I were looking at a paint that has a specific texture and homo center and make sure that I really read the directions and look at what that manufacture was recommending for the application process and get those correct tools and do the proper prep work for it\nBecause some of those textures or you know kind of labor intensive forward the wire and you want to make sure you get it right\nAbsolutely [laughter] okay well I Will look into the\nThings you suggested here and make a decision then I Hope that helps you out it does say something much well\nNow we are entering the heating season and maybe a lot of your actually already in the heat in full swing the time of year you really want to try and get the most out of your energy dollar and to do that you've got to keep that\nAnd if you are actually already in the heat in full swing the time of year you really want to try and get the most out of your energy dollar and to do that you've got to keep that draft but those aren't always just found it really ...\nYeah now my favorite place that sneaky drafts happen or switch place in outlets annexed your your walls you know air gets into those walls and those draft from the outside will just zipped right in the inside if they're not properly seal\nThe fix is very simple you can pick up some pre cut phone gas gets they're available at home centers and hardware stores are literally pains of peace and then slip them under the cover place they do a great job of keeping those dress out\nI mean truly like one of ... improvement they can make that will make a very noticeable difference in your ... which is amazing to me the other thing if you find that you have a larger gap on the Syrian walls\nYou can try and fill this African expand your phone and I kind of an air flour and I like it it's not going to happen he wrote an surpass from coming in so if you want to do that as well you can make them a little while just to turn strengthened and keep the little rodent ads from chewing there my aunt\nYeah good point so lots of ways to try to cut back on those traps but I'll tell you what they do add up so given the now before I could see terribly cold it'll be a lot more comfortable all winter long then can you get the name of the day\nI got to issue with they only leaking feeling I'm not sure if it's coming from from my roof or from my air conditioner she doesn't do it all the time that sometimes when it rains it comes down and other times I have\n[laughter]\nOr or or got kinda that allows we've got a metal roof structure house right I'm thinking maybe to drip they get they don't want more it goes into a God or in you know but like I said I've not had any luck 'cause I have it fixed and then it it'll come arraigned and then again\nIt comes in again right so what you're doing the fiction that human stealing the seems in the in the metal roof\nYeah we got up and put a from Calcutta the stuff on ... you know where to edge stuff was and now that are supposed to be a twenty year roof and we had an older house probably\nAbout ... who's the metal roof is supposed to be a hundred year roof metal ribs last a long time here's what I Would do I would try to make it so I Would go up there if you can you get up there that area with a hose yeah so I Would try to make it leaks I Would try\nYou know the normal light duty rainfall when it falls down from the top and she died than anything and then I Would try some directional pressure against those scenes and see if I can figure out what type of driving rain storms coming in your ... I suspect that is do the rain\nOr driving in those in it might be trapped in there and that's why he comes up days later after rainfall I I don't know\nBut I I think what you're gonna have to do is to try to figure out what part of that is breaking down and then once you do if you already going the ... I Would suggest taken apart that section of the roof and then putting it back together with the proper ceiling to make sure you get it done once and for all\nRight okay All right no way to ... ... we've got to repair the Salem the owner or a part of the ...\nYeah I Know you ... you got this week on yeah and by the way when you do repair that stealing make sure you primer on it because if you don't prime over leaks things that they're going to come right through now finch saying okay\nYeah I actually I like what we're going to do is put up a a little lip sobbing or a lack of not paying lame but at the top client that'll go up and get rid of the popcorn but it's up there right\nNow yeah well let's say you know that for most expensive words and home improvement while you're at it\n[laughter] yeah All right they live with that project thanks so much for calling us in aid money pet\nMe in Kansas on the line with excellent question tell us what you were working on\nIt I don't have that I got into survivor ship and then got an old probably was built in the sixties haven't been on the prairie of Kansas on the head and the way concrete porch\nIt just keeps kayaking and kayaking and did earthquakes and they had a pretty good one a week or so ago\nAnd now it's really um level hum ... small enough that I could fail and aren't on level and I'm just wondering 'cause I don't know I don't live near a loan or a Home Depot or anything like that and things like an hour and a half drive away on the local hardware store about ten miles and you feel well ... where\nHe or do you need con that great I don't know what the different are\nOK so first of all the type of repair mature uses different types of material you would use if you are safe for your new concrete slab and you mentioned quick read that's a great friend and they have a wide variety of repair products um you have the option to repair the cracks you could also re surface that concrete is a product for that\nAnd in all cases they the difference between that type of product a repair product in the original sort of concrete ... is it the repair parts are designed to adhere to the original concrete base\nYou know if it's if anything is loose course shift the pop it out and restore it but\nI'm sure that there are plenty of conquer repair products that are out there and you know you're going to obviously have to get yourself to hardware store or a lumber yard and find that you can do some research on line that their website but you want to make sure you choose a repair product because it is designed specifically to adhere to those surfaces\nOkay thank you so much All right\nGood luck it eight six six six three nine seven four\nUp when it comes to maintaining their own painting is among the thick of the projects\nYou think it's easy guys and they also a project that can go terribly wrong if you don't do three things before you start\nGoing to share that hadn't said building with confidence presented by writing mortgage backed like in my\n\n\nYeah and the key is it comes down to preparation weathered surfaces to be clean in anyone's paint needs to be removed\nBefore even think about open a can of paint them if not who's going to happen that new paint is not going to stick to that old paint and your efforts will be totally wages or it might take the pain but at the ... the would guess what it's all going to peel off including new pain so ... is really key\nNext it only smart to apply a coat of primary\nFirst a lot of people that don't have primaries formulated differently than paint that's meant to be that top calling it got better decision can stick to the old surfer preventing new paint peeling and\nSearch for the best in his look you want to make sure you choose the right kind of paint brush now natural bristle brush his are best replying oil these peace but for latex synthetic bristle brush is whoever the best result in they're going to help

a real accurate and personal my mortgage collision based on your unique financial situation you know hitting the their hassle\nRocket mortgage by Quicken Loans apply simply understand fully and mortgage competently\nAnd in that weighs on the line with the question what we do for you today\nWe pay around the bottom half foundation with the net and saying okay and what I wanted to know can we you know paint over that with regular pain or would that lead through\nThe summit and send mixes like stucco next writing his that's his that's is that sticking to that foundation is breaking off in any way or is it so so\nNow it's in good shape but I wanted it I really wanted to paint it some of the neighbors painted and they look nice it would it would it be OK\nOkay so what what you need to do is you need the prime it first you use the masonry primer that's really important\nThat you had the fan that out you know as long as it's intact okay good shape yeah\nThen you need to Private First 'cause the primaries what's going to make the top right make a top layer of paint stick so to speak to your primary first with the primary dry really really well and then you could put on the top ... quality paint\nOn top of that and it should be fine but just remember you know after ... so what you pay the first time you're gonna have to pay that again and again as years go\nBy yeah OK primer on
