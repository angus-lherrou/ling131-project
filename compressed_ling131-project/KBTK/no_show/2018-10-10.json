J. Simpson were on those ugly burned O'Malley shoes and a Monday Night football game in Cincinnati and I said that bill ranking photographer built could you get a picture of me and the alarm strong and Neal said why do you want my picture [laughter] I said\nWell Neal you know you walk on them and they were the first man to walk on the moon is that so I ... I got the picture and immediately hurried off\nAnd um that was it and other people came up their pictures taken with him and he was uneasy didn't want it to happen seat Neil Armstrong was an engineer\nHe didn't see themselves as a pilot and the furthest thing from the truth was a hero he taught for seven years at University of Cincinnati in the school of engineering and every student had him said he was a wonderful teacher a great professor very bright\nBut when you see the University of Cincinnati approached them do named the skilled engineer and then Neal a Armstrong school of engineering but that makes sense\nBut that makes sense that the school of engineering after Cincinnati zone Neil Armstrong answered the yes but Neal said absolutely not I don't want my name on buildings I don't want that and within a few months\nHe left you see and what he did at that point\nWas simply serve on boards of directors had a farm in Warren County which is a county north of Cincinnati and you see I see I'm Out now and then it events but nobody would ever know that fat was Neil Armstrong that was the man who walked on the moon because he never carried himself away in any way that Neal was any special than anyone else\nSo in the movie comes out on friday you're going to see the actual real depiction of Neil Armstrong and that was difficult it was to go to the moon and Nineteen sixty nine when there was less than a fifty fifty chance it would come back alive and in fact NASA drafted a two page statement\nTelling the American people that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin did not make it and that there forever lost in space because that was the probability of what was going to happen the odds are going there and coming back and being successful in living was\nLess than fifty fifty but Neal took that risk in fact eleven other men\nTook it over the next three years and we're not going back to the moon since continue with your call back to the south that was a talk show hosts a frivolous number to call his eight seven seven three one two three eight one wants\nTo see that movie hit a fabulous movie movie reminded me of the ten commandments\nStill counting on the great American ... from Austin [noise]\nAsk any a Mac remember what they like most about belonging to the conservative alternative to a A R T and they'll tell you how much they love reading a max magazine a Mac advantage a Mac is pleased to announce that they're now publishing a Mac advantage six times a year\nFor presidents had done because the radical left inside the federal government worked against them from day one\nRight and that helps that helps Iran North Korea Russia and China in fact the senator from Beijing which is what Dianne Feinstein known as in New York by the Chinese here\nThe senator from Beijing this is foreign influence in our government a foreign agent of red China like congressman Dianne Feinstein she won that started this big hoopla about a a judge Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh are allegedly raping and all that stuff\nSo they influence is more than their numbers and we're actually I think a very big trouble and out of nowhere comes Trump\nI I never thought I Would embrace a political guy as much as I I I Love Trump\nAnd in fact in fact look at it this way that radical Democratic Party has United the Republican Party I never thought I Would ever say good things about Senator Susan Collins I\nDidn't think it was possible for me to enjoy Mitch McConnell Oregon Lindsey Graham those three and Chuck Grassley had been fabulous I Can't believe the benefits now the Republican Party has gained because of the activities of the Democrats and I think Trump is going to be blessed to have a Democrat run against him\nLike Pocahontas or Cory Booker with the crazy eyes\nAre Kamala Harris it had it listed sexual affairs with mayor Willie Brown she's left her way to the top it's going to be wonderful to have those kind of people running against Trump if there was a Bill Clinton in his prime or twenty oh eight or Obama out there I think Trump would be in trouble but look at who has to run again this\nIs going to be wonderful I Would encourage Michael anonymity to keep seeking the Democratic party nomination that\nGuy would do a great job and so now many of the Democratic party wouldn't you agree it'd be wonderful\nHe deserves it and we heard the term survivor has two survivors Kathleen willy is a survivor judge Kavanaugh is the ultimate survivor\nSee this wasn't will report it because it was Clinton\nBut in the oval office in Nineteen Ninety four Kathleen Willie want them to get a job because her husband and recently died\nShe was a democratic activists ... Virginia She knew Bill Clinton she got an appointment he took her into the oval office and sexually assaulted her as president in the White House Kathleen Willie\nNow now the Democratic party knew what happened\nAnd they did nothing about it because they couldn't care less about women about victims of sexual assault if they did they would not nominated enabler like Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen they couldn't care less about women being sexually assaulted when they care about is power and money and prestige and that's where the Democratic party's after\nRight there in the environmental movement there in the O.

kid and updating our will go through an event that we bought it by a reporter and creating a truck for ethics\nAnd my question is do you any advice for how do we wind down the trust when the gum comes with age don't necessarily want to give them millions of dollars on the team but in order to want to do that over him right until he was like thirty five either\nGood good balance I like that I agree with both statements and so you wind down by releasing some of it a different times\nUm we had our set up a before our kids you know became adults are trying to serve the same situation so\nWe put together we both get hit by a bus with millions of dollars in a trust to be good use only for their good are we did not leave the money to the guardian we left it into a trust which is the proper thing to do the trust is formed only at your death\nWe put in that trust exactly how the money was to be invested the four types of mutual funds for instance that I recommend we put in that trust that the income off of the investments could be used for the care and feeding of the kids and the use of the guardian it there will beyond that if they needed money out of that trust\nAnd had to be for a major medical thing possibly a little bit on the first car and paying for college\nBut coming out of college when you graduate from college we would release a percentage and then we'd released another percentage of twenty five and another present at twenty seven I think we did a maybe a third third third I don't remember but we let them kind of roll it out a little bit like you say I don't want to hold a too long but\nAlso don't want an Eighteen year old to hit the lottery\nAnd things like what we're doing too so\nYeah so you lay all of that that way and um you know we put hours on end and

some\nOf the time I tried to get to the point as fast as I can um I I call you back in January um about a a one point eight million dollar inheritance\nI'm back asking you how it should handle that and he told me how to do so and I take my time and be patient with it and it was very helpful but now I'm having a another problem whereas\nI'm so basically since then I bought a house remodel the air being be making a lot of money about fifty thousand dollars a month\nOn gross I'm about yeah about Fifteen thousand dollars a month and I'm just blowing through the addict crazy sex addiction\nUm I'm standing just insane amounts of money that ten thousand dollars a month on prostitutes and strip clubs and I'm ... therapy all the above and I don't know what to do I have tried everything I go to sex addicts anonymous\nUm and I I I I Want to know what you would do in this situation I have done well I spent about how that money on buying a house in an airplane being it now and I'm doing well with that\nI'm not an accident than it's been a long project I finished but I don't know what to do about this how it should handle it what ... anything else that you would try that I haven't [noise]\n[noise] how old are you twenty okay and I'm\nThe inheritance came from who passed away\nSo my dad passed away about two years ago and um and I he was missing plane and I might be coming into a lot more money because I follow the child or wrongful death situation is um ... if it's a long story about your mom\nMy mom she's out of the picture that divorced I barely talk to her um [noise] I cheat sheet at the picture\nI ... as you know job and I'm not a therapist I'm not a trained councilor um I have worked with addicts for Thirty years but goes one hundred percent of the addicts end up broke\nIf if they don't feel their addiction and so you are going to destroy\nYour legacy your dad's legacy with the money that was left to you and you're going to destroy all your future dreams that this money represents if we don't if you don't get the help and he'd the help and\nSite to win against the addiction um sex addictions and pornography addictions are the fastest growing addictions in America that we see that in our offices with financial trouble um people in your situation more than any other addiction\nWe see we still see cocaine we still see 'em and we don't treat for that but we ended up helping them with their finances we still see alcohol and uh but gambling and sex are both just ... the the\nPornography is a is a is gone crazy because of the Internet access and um uh it's affecting every part of our lives and good ways in bad ways but the access in this case is causing\nExcess and gets people in real trouble with gambling and porn sex addictions um\nSo you're you you know you named off a couple of the right things and that's getting an essay getting in a um a an anonymous group I'm getting in a with a therapist is the second thing I Would do um the third thing I Would do is\nUm [noise] it it sounds to me like just a guy talking to a young guy an old guy talking to a young guy that all of your family structure has gone it's just you didn't have it with your mom and then your dad died and so you're you're just left without any authority\nStructure is a twenty year old young guy there's nobody in your life kind of standing over your shoulder is going to stump you when you grew up your life\nYeah I I I Do have a family on my dad's side I'm actually a good way\nBut they know what's going on you know so I Know\nThere were I had some problems going on like over a year ago a like a fact and that's just a and I I never and whenever I tried it with them they kind of they were like a cheesy oh you're just being picked on this that and I never kind of trust again okay with them so I just kind of put off the illusion that\nOK everyone's okay but that's fine so that there are no help is what you're saying yeah OK\nOr no help but they they they're they're good but I just I don't know how\nWell I Know that all behaviors obviously have a psychology involved um as a person of faith as a Christian I also believe behaviors or spiritual and show to treat or something like this only as a psychological thing is usually a half\nTreatment treated only like it's a spiritual thing might very well be half treatment but um there there is something that you're obviously searching for\nAnd there's something that you're missing 'em that's causing you too I'm literally go crazy in this part of your life right\n[noise] yeah I I I think it's like I'm just beyond lonely I don't know if it's that um but um [noise] I I don't know honestly\nI think that's probably right that doesn't sound wrong [noise] how can I can resonate with that I can imagine you being there in that situation and it's amazing you can be in one of the largest cities in the world and be lonely\nYou know but you can be it's very very real um the saw the last component I Would add to it um\nAnd you're asking me so you always get my opinion when you're asking me and that I'm an expert on my opinion [laughter] so ah what I Would tell you do is find a great church and will help you do that and and sit down and get\nPast store all counseling to go with your other counseling get with some young guys in that church and become friends with some people who have some character\nHave some integrity and that are walking a straight line not perfect\nIsn't any perfect people over there are at that church ... churches got people in them so you can find that out pretty quick but you\nWill find a book or synagogue or no you're Jewish okay cool that's more effect then let's get one of the rabbi do let's get the spiritual element of those going because there's a there's an aspect of that\nGoes with this and if that's your heritage and that's your your your face in wonderful on by cause of the town that has a lot to say about the issues that you're dealing with um a lot\nAnd um so yeah I that's the only thing I Know how to tell you though because I Can't just yell at you stop it or you would have already stopped it I mean you're smart guy you've already realizes just ruining your life\nAnd um you know that I Know that um but the nature of an addiction is and you're finding this from the twelve steps is that one of the thing is you realize you're powerless\nAnd you know God has to step in and I've got to put some structures in my life and I've got a you know figure out uh do do some careful psych self analysis and say well loneliness is the

are in the process of trying to consider buying a house the challenge will run into is that we own to rental houses\nAnd we currently rent the one we live and then we don't want to take on more debt and so we're trying to figure out whether we should sell the rental properties or um you know how to just sort of cynical that and I'm not getting into too much debt\nOkay do you have um what is what are these rentals worth\nWell one of the challenges that we face it the the rental properties are actually out of town on them on the military guy and we're currently living in Dayton, Ohio but\nA rental properties are in Georgia in Virginia so but I'm the value\nSell them yes I Would not long distance landlord\nOkay no that's your health and they were asking for trouble you need the money you're in the military are trying to buy a home and you need the money and you don't need to be alone you got you did not set out to own rental property everywhere these rental properties by\nDefault\nWas not there you're not you're five your strategy to buy rental properties all over the United states\n\nTo 'em that's been the inclination that I've been getting from a couple of folks that have been talking to my mom I haven't seen that they've been successful I've had renters that have been paying the mortgage and um it seemed like there there's the possibility of the value of going up\nAnd put them under the values go up but I'm also sure somebody's gonna change their hardly oil in your living room because you're out of town [laughter] this is going to happen I I I've got rental properties man I got a bunch of them I'm I'm rental property for forty years and um you've\nGot to be I just don't\nDo any long distance land or they don't have any property that I ran out that is not in my town\nAnd are you did not by not by the properties plan you ended up with them and you're trying to move on to the next phase of your life which is home ownership use your long distance landlord and you don't even own your own home I personally was so both of them are meeting like you do what you wanted but that's what I\nThis is the ... [noise]\nI get this question all the time they wouldn't it be smarter for me to sell my house myself\nThe answer is really simple the typical for sale by own our home sales for one hundred and Ninety thousand dollars for the typical home sold by an agent is two hundred and forty nine thousand dollars I'll do the math for you that's fifty nine thousand dollar difference\nDumb idea\nEighty eight percent of the time that people take debt con solid Asian loans out but don't change their habits and there are other debts back up the only time I tell people to move that into a debt consolidation is to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure and you're not asking me about either one of those\nSo I think your bank wants to see you deeply in debt does that's what banks do\nSo let's when a\nBank says hey I got a great idea what they're really saying is hey I can make some money off of you\n\nI mean really like playing with a skunk and wondering why you got sprayed seriously it's not it's not a pet it's a skunk so don't pet it lets\nYou this is what you're dealing with or without my show no ... no no no no no\nAllen on Twitter says I just got laid off and I need to move my four oh one K. tomorrow ...\nShould I go ahead and do that if I have a chance of coming back and working for the same company in the future\nI Would roll into a regular IRA not Ross IRA because if we roll into a traditional I radio no taxes and unless you got a real power money and just want to pay those taxes right now I Would not converted to Iraq but what role went to a traditional even if you're going back because\nThat portion then at least as in your control you restart your four O. one K. there's no advantage to having lift your money back there no mathematical advantage I reckon or

week I completed my debt free during if I ever for your panel over four thousand a hundred and Seventy five dollars\nAnd um well I'm trying to figure out now in terms of buying a house what is the best way to kind of saying I'm going out except in thinking about just talking the money but also investing to maybe get a better rate of return by doing that way what what are your thoughts on that\nRight Tom drink too much you're going to save\nWell as of right now my monthly expenses are only about eleven hundred so out of my salary try to say about twenty two to twenty three hundred and if I really buckle down about twenty six hundred\nOkay a month correct for how long [noise] well the ... at the house\nOf looking at like a twenty percent on a down payment hundred and fifty probably about at least ten months\nBare minimum that clear on that ... percent behind that year should be able to get that include bonuses impact your turn them such\nWell twelve months will be thirty thousand box\nAnd if you invested started thousand dollars which you don't have the day but if you were to invest a thirty thousand dollars and it made ten percent and one year you would make three thousand dollars\nCorrect okay I'm now we don't have three thirty thousand dollars so it's like over the course of that year you'd have more like an average of Fifteen thousand dollars invested and so if you make ten percent you'd make about Fifteen hundred dollars\nMhm okay and so if you have thirty thousand dollars at the end of one\nOr you have thirty one thousand five hundred dollars to\nPut down on the house doesn't matter much fall immigrant\nThe point I was appointed as huge saving money on the short term as aggressively as you have the ability to save money um is the secret sauce not the investment\n\nOkay during this year Jordan is worth thirty grand mutual fund Fifteen hundred Jordan is the answer to our equation\nOkay that makes sense yes\nThank you for joining us Solomon is with us in Atlanta Hi Solomon welcome Ramsey Joe\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nAll day long story short ah I'm I'm a doctor graduated from medical school just finished

been granted it\nOut of thirty to out of thirty thousand it's a complete scam it's not happening the government is screwed you're so good I'm Glad you're not signed up for that so what is your income please God told me it's large\nIt all my combined I'm married to with my wife uh about three hundred and thirty\nGood [noise]\nOkay so you're gonna ... you don't get to live like a doctor because you're a broke Dr yeah you're going to live like a college student okay help you out and start buying cram\nCan't answer that have you started buying crap bought bought one thing is one what the card what'd you buy\nA A R I got yeah yeah uh now do you know what did you pay for about a thousand\nOkay you're a three hundred and eighty thousand dollars in debt you can never do that again\nCan never do anything like that again you're not going on vacation you're not buying a house you or a broke doctor\nHere's the thing you have this absolutely fabulous income and you are going to destroy your wealth building ability with that income if you don't clears that up and treat it like it's cancer and we're going to hit it with chemo and everything we got\nOut of hand so that I Am not a band aid off slowly guy that crap does not work and so what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes I Would live on fifty thousand dollars a year or less\nWhich would make me debt free and under three years\nOkay and then I Would start my life the great news is you have the ability to delay pleasure for a greater outcome we know that because you have gone to school your whole freaking life and you're very smart academically\nOr you wouldn't be where you are okay you have the ability to delay pleasure which is a sign of emotional maturity and you have a great intellect let you use those two things and apply them to this mess that you are in called deeply in debt now you can do is the other way but I'll tell you that\nYour colleagues\nAre walking around out there with three hundred four hundred two hundred thousand dollars worth of medical school that for a decade because they play with it and they never kill the disease the only way you kill it is extreme treatment\nRadical and that's the only way it goes away it's going to stay with you forever otherwise\nSo that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes I Would treat it like I Am I broke doctor because I'm a broke doctor and broke doctors don't by fifty thousand dollar cars are going to develop a lot of vacations\nSo you're not doing that crap anymore you get on a tight budget beans and rice rice and beans and clean up this mess 'cause if you take the three year old older than you are now you and go forward with a three or four hundred thousand dollar income and no debt urine it'd be so wealthy it's going to be blinding\nIf you watch what you're doing\nBut if you just screw around with this thing and keep it like it's a pet it's going to be a problem for you Laurie is whether it's in Boise\nHi Laurie how are you Hi Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's up I'm\nAt this point where I could be giving 'em\nRight now at her and my mom has been in ... and I moved here at the fall and she is in a very very small ram and a large one and I was wondering what that he could get him\nTo help get her ... her semi private ram and help pay for her cost of living\nTrue or somebody giving 'em would it be typing no but it would be giving yes um I don't ... I mean I don't know what you mean by giving but um you have the money to do this or you broke her what\nNo I have the money again okay and you're you're out of debt yeah okay\nAnd you have or how much money in your nest egg\nThree hundred and how old are you having good very good okay what's your income about Ninety thousand cool you single or single and what are you talking about spending\nIt will cost me about a thousand dollars a month\nThe twelve ran out of Ninety and you can keep saving doing that 'cause you don't have any that you can keep investing so you retire with dignity and you can take care of yourself when you're in the exact same situation later right\nThat's what I Want to ... where you don't put yourself exposed to the elements so to speak by helping someone else but I think it's wonderful you have the money you've done a great job you're out of debt and you're in a position you want to give twelve thousand dollars a year towards your mom sure no problem with that\nOK absolutely what do they want to do the right thing and it was like you said about giving if I just wanted to make sure I was doing the right thing found\nI think you are just wonderful gift and uh your your kind to her and you know what a wonderful\nYou know act of love torture mama and and and again you put yourself in a position you have the money to do that without bringing harm\nTo yourself and that's that's what we're talking about live like no one else so later you can live and the gills like no one else very very cool Tony is with us Tony is in a Washington\nHi Tony how are you I'm well how can I help\nI was curious why you advocate a money market accounts are low yield accounts for like a murky coupon\nCause your emergency fund is not an investment it's insurance okay it's there the principal has to be there and accessible and liquid because if you're transmission goes out or you lose your job you get your hands on it\nThe right of return is irrelevant it's insurance the protects the things that does make you money to see what happens is people don't have an emergency fund act accessible and they got to set up in something where they get penalized if it comes out is not liquid and then they they have an emergency you know what they do\nThe bar owner four one K. long\nLike a four one K. loan to borrow against or for winter that cash out worse yet\nAnd they create a mess because they got to do that to save their house 'cause they didn't have money that was liquid they got stuck because there were all worried about trying to make an extra point or two on the money instead of Kurt treating it like it's insurance insurance is ... is an expense\nMoney tied up at one percent you would agree is an expense because it sucks it's a horrible right of return it could be invested in be making more\nBut in that portion that five or ten or twenty thousand dollars or whatever it is is just sitting there\nJust as a barrier between you and the life\nAnd that's all it's for it's not an investment it's insurance investments make money insurance costs you money to protect the things that make you money and this is insurance some good question though that that's the whole reasoning behind that thanks for calling him\nOpen phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five\nYeah we're in a rainy day fund you know why because it's gone on\nIn

banker with UPS in New York His world view has been turned upside down in the lead to two thousand sixteen period when he was exposed to world changing science\nWhich suggested that country the mainstream assumptions consciousness has not produced by the brain now after researching extensively he wrote this book in the end the upside down thinking to introduce all of us to these cutting edge ideas and your use on coast to coast I've got this really shocked you initially mark didn't it\nAbsolutely shocked me thank you for having me on\nI'm looking forward to this too I always ask questions of gas scientists and people who are experts on the brain\nDodge consciousness exist outside of the brain or not now the pure scientists Joe the medical professional folks mark would always say you have to have the brain in order to have consciousness in the brain dies it all goes with it\nAnd I've always thought no there's something else here with consciousness you finally found out did\nI did and I I was very squarely in what's known as the material is science camp which suggests that the universe is fundamentally made of matter there was a big bang about Thirteen point eight billion years ago filling the universe with physical material that we call matter\nAnd when you have enough matter in this big universe you're bound to get interactions between those pieces of matter we call that chemistry\nWhen you have enough random chemical reactions you're ... you're bound to end up with\nA self replicating molecule like DNA chance says that would happen and DNA leads to the evolution of living organisms like a human being the human being developed the brain and consciousness awareness comes out of the brain that the perspective\nAnd if you buy into that which I used to then when the brain dies consciousness dies memories are gone\nThan when you think about meaning in life\nIf you take the material is perspective very strictly there can't be any meaning because once one at a dead there is no memories there is no consciousness and that's the prevailing perspective as you mentioned in in our science and most of science today\nKnow looking at your bio I Would lose money in a bet saying that you would write a book about consciousness how in the heck did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter] so it\nWas about two years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally a materialist that's what I Would call it now in hindsight\nBut I I randomly stumbled across a cast that started talking about these ideas I was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the queue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had and at the end of it her name is Laura Powers\nShe mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers and I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula and I listen to a different episodes and people there were many different people have talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities\n... for consciousness to survive bottle that things I had no familiarity with\nAn overtime just hearing enough different people describing similar perspective unreality I got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real\nAnd this was a very jarring and disorienting realization for me because I thought life was meaningless\nAnd here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer of consciousness maybe the brain more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that processes consciousness and the identity that we have is not tied to the body\nSo that totally freaked me out and a change in my world view completely led me down the path of intense research because I needed to rethink all reality spent about a year of basically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in financing consulting\nAnd as I was doing that I told friends overtime at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive\nThese were people who like me didn't have any familiarity with the topics um and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight so after hearing enough of this feedback and also saying that I had in tents\nTo put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened\nSo it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend\nAnd I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco and decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days and ended up\nWriting more than half of the book is now out and then finish over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript and ultimately a cold email Gladstone who is now my agent and my publisher\nMultiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents Eckhart totally\nAmong the good people out of Walsh and so\nThat's where we are super now what did you mean by an end to upside down thinking\nI consider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness\nThrough a brain so the brain creates consciousness what I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing yawn space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness\nConsciousness comes first\nRight without the brain does consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests\nNo with science back us up\n[noise] so my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body so one example is chapter nine or I talk about near death experiences\nAnd if you'd asked me a few years ago with in your experience I Would have said well isn't that just a nation that happens when someone about to die like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described it in near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness it's not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as ... out of body experience so the person out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back to their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that it suggests to some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark Goldberg dot com is linked up for you it's coast to coast am dot com the name of his book we're talking about an end to upside down thinking or me or read

more stimulating talk pastor Kim Masters destined to win Ninety set on why one tomorrow ten o'clock\nTo twelve Pacific time by the way from critical Health News dot com ... ... is is with us right now as we talk about his work in in the upside down thinking mark\n... what did your peers say and your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise them\nIt's a great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes there were very surprised to hear that but I think I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before ... the pre cognition telecast now psycho couldn't he says you you of course we learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nYeah absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science and controlled study that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about ... what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation my aunt that way who was a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigating telepathy and uh she ... she came out with some astounding things but what did you find\nIt yeah I thought that these are very important phenomenon it's it's mind my communication and just taking a quick step back the\nReason that I Am each of these phenomenon is that I read them that the material is perspective\nAnd his localized to the brain that perspective cannot account for things like till after the and the other things will talk about and I read them that if any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness century picture does work\nSo left in the to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns felt experiment and the basic design is as follows and I should\nSay that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter as and when you combine the results the statistics are very compelling mhm\nDoctor dean rating who just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called six sigma six sigma refers to statistical odds against chance when you get a six sigma result the odds that the that the effect is just happening by chance is more than a billion to one and in telepathy we have six sigma results\nSo the ... experiment the study has one person in a room we'll call him Bob and very you know very relaxing state listening to relaxing music there's another person let's call her Jane who's in another room\nJane is given a picture by the experiment yours and the experimenter stay Jane I Know this sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally sent\nA picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room so jaded mentally sending this image to Bob Bob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what picture game was looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all at Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent right\nNow the ... the last probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials but instead it's closer to thirty two percent\nSo from a statistical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect is twenty five versus thirty two this is massive statistically it's suggested something is getting through and it actually conforms to our common sense our everyday experience because if we were one hundred percent ... then we would know each other's thoughts all the time\nYou're instead it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they tax you where they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two versus twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nWhat could increase ... percent mark is at the center or the receiver\n[noise] this is something that that needs to be explored much more ah but what we see with people who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a have had been involved in the U.S government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and\nPeople who are better meditate or ... seemed to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI've always wondered though if somebody is really tuned into certain things if they can pick up all kinds of different events without really having the sender having much to do with it\nI I I think that's the receiver might have a better effect in changing the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... ethic work communications with the deceased\nThrough medium ship these are people that tend to be picking up information\nAnd if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's it's helpful metaphor where there's a consciousness that's not localized to the body those who are able to better configure their antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular standard or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver the person in the room and simply not shield them any of them for pictures but they just have to tell you what they think she said to them what do you think would happen\nWell well I think\nWe'd have a distribution first of all we had just an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic than we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw with the U.S government uh but if it's an everyday person I think it would be a different more difficult to study to examine because the effect is so small\nWell let's talk about the U.S government studies in uh the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me I'm the program is\nSometimes referred to as Stargate Program and used psychic spies for national security purposes many of Marines have\nBeen on this show by the way\nUp during the Cold War and and the people who were involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many reviewers who are involved to say this was a real so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real [noise] I'm\nIn my book I I have some documents from the CIA which had been declassified recently\nAnd the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was won by remote viewing\nIs the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being they're physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that's far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes it sounds completely paranormal consciousness is localized to the brain\nBut if consciousness is non local then it's at least conceivable\nDocuments um say explicitly and I am looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon\nThis is from a declassified documents that has been released recently [laughter] so I mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I saw something like that in my business world that I had a consulting case for example that's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me at least made me question things\nUm even further than that there's a page on science and all and there are some very credible people including someone from Cal Tech\nThe next page in the document says science panel's report principle findings either direct quotes implications are revolutionary evidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we looked at these tell a path to good studies\nAnd I've always wondered\nIf the government really never stopped doing it must continue now I've asked some of the people who've been involved in these studies that just that same question and they said no it stopped because they would've kept us on they would have used a ...\nI'm not sure what the government has found other people and they've continued these kinds of blindness studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used\nTo find a down just rushing calmer in an African jungle that they couldn't find so there was some utility to the program whether it was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful so you'd have to think that if if it were a useful thing to be doing that a organizations would be trying it\nPre cognition mark the very valuable tool for people in their life because of the ability to sense things make decisions based on those gut feelings and to react to them you know a lot of people don't react\nAnd they go oh I should have done that and I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre cognition\nSo there are some studies\nWhich show a very subtle pre cognition known as ... sentiment where the bodies sensing something very subtly and we need to stick to ... to show it before something happens and there are other examples where it's much more explicit where a person has a dream known as a ... dream the dream something and then the next day it happened exactly as they dreamed it\nAs I went through school one giant question\nLoomed over what did I Want to be\nFirst I had to decide what I wanted to

through the media and not have to you know almost on demand type of thing but\nIt's yeah I mean there are there are some um\nBetter pieces equipment up there and there are some that are of course but you know there's nothing wrong with the good thermal imaging camera or a good uh I I Can't remember a a good record\nAnd Maureen how 'bout you will technology you change things\nUm you know I honestly don't think that technology has reached the point that makes it more sensitive than human beings you know and then what we can sense ourselves on and we may be getting close with some areas that they're they're finding out but honestly I don't think it's sensitive enough yet\nSo you're not going to be replaced by a robot ghost investigator anytime\nSharon [laughter] I don't I don't think so\nAll right let's go to a final calls here let's go to Z Hastings, Florida bill's with us and bill are you in a safe haven there were ... hurricane headed your way\nWe're on the other side of the state we're south of St Augustine so I think we're uh we're probably going to be safe on this one\nOkay was friends with everybody else is going to\nYeah it goes story for you or when we came down here about eight years ago in Florida we were at a a paranormal investigation and the old Spanish military hospital and playing Oregon State which is known to be haunted\nAnd while we were there a ghost a this was in the middle of the night that goes to actually made a table moved slightly up on the second floor\nSo he went up to the second floor and we were able to communicate with the ghost wife Susan and I and some other people that were there and we [noise] we had a a mini man flashlight on a table and the ghost could answer our questions by making the lights blink\nAnd uh so risky various questions and to get it to indicate that its name was only and then it was a was a been a nurse at a at the hospital at one time during the Spanish period\nJeez you know I guess they end up at the time my aunt am I in a briefcase with me and I was carrying around a large amount of money and then subsequently um for about the next year so I'm trying to time it would hear clicking noises that goes just teasing me that he was opening the briefcase\nI Love it\nNow while I'm On flow and asking is um if you drop like a little I don't care for profit sharing something um last last about a mountain last July but the one before that in the middle of the night well having a little tiny bottle campers something fell off the side of the\nChair and it's fun and like I was kind of speed\nFloor\nWhy are they mischief makers Ron ... what are they trying to accomplish by pleading around like\nSometimes the that just attention seekers they they just want to be\nSeen or heard other words that you know where I Am here pay attention to if you have a a cat for instance the cats are pretty much like that to a you know they'll they'll come in and and do silly things to let you know they're there and have pay attention to me so I I think that's that's primary it\nBut uh I I have to tell a funny story about the a book I left it to my next door neighbor and ... and the\nNext day I came back I met her and she came back with the book and she said hey I take it back she says we were reading the or the first chapter and I was having a glass of wine and my glass shattered\nOh so she says I don't want anything to do with it [laughter]\nIt's like glass shuttering bucks\nHere during the ... thing\nTo do anything really what they want to do I believe\nNext in tweets Tom what do you

since I have a granddaughter who is you know too young to do that sort of thing but she's picking up the actually she thinks spirits are ready um\nSo what we're doing is we have a\nMichael's prayer card that I quite underneath you know her mattress and in her pillow and I have a very in crystals around the room to how much energy\nOn and she's doing a lot better so I Know you know and again and belief right so I Believe it works on its intention networks I think if you have to believe in yourself as well on you can tend to\nHave bought out bought out most times which\nYou Ron what about it\nWell I agree with it away and and you judge because you talk about the ... the hurry came in your intentions sure\nMake it yeah so and tensions as a hundred percent but being a good old Catholic boy I rely on my religion the costs and so that's that's what I always recommend\nYou know and I've seen this happen before I've seen hurricanes go from a category four down to two don't do well and you know who's the sea prayer is\nYou know what it works\nYeah crank Korea hundred percent with the judge\nSneak in any way we can let's go to bill in Idaho west of the Rockies Hi Bill go ahead dawn

story of the hour\nWell the big story of the hour as the fallout from Taylor Swift don't know if you heard about that oh yeah yeah ... this week on Instagram announce it she's supporting Tennessee's Democratic Senate candidate Phil bred and\nNow it did cause a a not only a backlash from people in the pop culture world who maybe are more than the conservative side of the island hooked Taylor Swift shed they're feeling the first time she's really gotten political and talked about her political leanings and she came out in full support of the Democrats one of the other\nThings that happened after this proclamation from Taylor Swift\nIs that there was a spike in voter registration some both in Tennessee and nationwide where a breath and faces a close race against Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn they're all they're fighting it out for Bob Corker seed in Tennessee he's retiring\nAccording to vote dot org Taylor Swift pose to her one hundred and twelve million Instagram followers seem to have\nHelped bring out young voters a majority of new registrations since Sunday have been for people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine and according to the group and that's that sixty four thousand out of the one hundred and five thousand total new registrations nationwide since Sunday or in this age group so that\nI I think we just count the power of social media I Know we understand that it well trends\nWent about it I Know I'll eat already like this celebrity that that I mean\nWhen somebody has the power of a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers will that I'll be the resonates and their personality\nA it is important to their followers are brand is important because that's a huge number when you think about calling the action and getting sixty four thousand out of a hundred and five thousand new voter registrations nature nationwide from the particular age group that Taylor Swift appeal to\nSame thing actually the highest ticket in Boston is seven and forty five bucks so uh they're on they're already on the road again I didn't I sing that before and un impressed by the I\nI always love your stinking so what happened is let's say Michelle Obama\nAnd block Obama go on the road what will people will pay the same amount or do to see them\nInteresting I was thinking about that too like who would be the bigger draw there's something about Bill Clinton I think and they're not for me believe me I ... yeah I have to pay me to go to both does that but\nI just feel like he had the chemistry I get Obama does chew and at first ladies go I think Michelle it more likeable than Hillary and I think Hillary loses that the force them but I'd imagine I don't know people still really love bill and they show up at the end\nThat depends what the age group as I think people my age don't care about Bill Clinton and they don't they did they say well\nI mean he was in office he was president when I was born and so when we were growing up\nAll we really knew about him was not his charisma that Monica Lewinsky\nAnd so I think people my age probably like Hillary more because they know more about Hillary or and they were around when she was running for office and then ... out of all of that and I think I Would definitely pay more or would have rather go and see Michelle in Iraq I Would\nNot do the cleaning ... between the two of 'em on

one minute his own or reprimanded for killing us out the next parties encouraged again\nThis is absolutely what the definition of neurotic behavior is here's my advice\nAnd I just had someone called me the other day Warren my dog is chewing all of my shoes what do I do in my getting my question was what do you do what you said when I see the dog with a shoe I take the shoe away and give the dog the toy retreat of his own which he did just and let the dog know that anytime he wants to treat\nAnytime you want the new toy or we have to do is grab issue see sometimes our dogs are a little bit

A. L. O. T. R. E. N. Calif written it get it by going to top last dot com\nWhat is misleading here and when we talk about the fake news media this is my very line that makes people go oh my gosh there's that Trump he hates the gays ... right and it it is so ridiculous because if you actually read the whole thing and I'm not calling you out here you'll find that are nothing\nI was I looked at the I forget the story and I looked at the headlines while we're only hearing cousin went so deeply into the weeds the first sentence set at all of us [laughter] yeah what kind of a confusing policies is and why do we have this policy I guess would have been\nMy question but you just rented out as usual well regulations that are on that you make thirty bucks yes it is okay so let's them as long as we're\nSort of in this area for a little bit as he um folks in England actually if you live in Wales this affects you as well you now have the option of entering into a civil partnership instead of a marriage\nVoting to the prime minister so what does that mean to me is any couple living together and those countries I eat England and Wales or can choose to have their relationship legally recognized without being married\nProgressive think only used to be only same sex couples could be granted a civil partnership but any couple now living together\nComes as the u._k. Supreme Court or face a case brought forth by not married couple they argue the current law is discriminatory discriminatory discriminatory probably\nToward heterosexual couples court agreed left it up to the parliament to decide those in favor of the change say\nCivil partnerships allow people who object to the idea of marriage to have the same legal and financial protections I think that's a swell idea do we have that protection I didn't even know if we have the protection here in our country I think that that we have now do we civil partnerships\nBut I Know I'm I'm not sure we do seem to me there's a controversy that happened here locally in Massachusetts a couple of living\nTogether one of them died and the other one wanted or\nThought yeah I think it's a state if they think he goes yeah by state doesn't it\nBut why not allow it is a question what difference does it make marriage is a is a governmental Christ\nI agree a hundred out it you should have to stipulate who that person is for you because a lot of people\nWho live together with someone who might be just a roommate\nAnd if they die and kicked the bucket and that roommate comes out and says well I've lived with that person for eight years for either heritage alive at everything [laughter] yeah I mean I think we all get to have a person I don't know if that person is ... is your partner or a friend or family member but I think we all should be able to designate that person regardless of marital status\nYep yes I agree so they have that in the u._k. maybe their end of the curve\nRight I just couldn't make it automatic because you know that portion of the renting your bedroom you don't want him to offer you and your sleep and\nTake it right [laughter] oh God no problem\nNot a good idea so I see that the um the I'm looking at some of the budget Jeremy I'm a nut case on budgets and spending money in her crazy we've gotten in spending spending spending\nA lot of money being spent on immigration crackdown but apparently a according to some members that have been released this week the number of people who are supposed to be deported like three million is with the promise number was it was only about ten percent of that yet we're spending a lot of money\nOr the budget has many holes in it thanks to all the efforts is it worth the effort is the question Jennifer is it worth the time and the effort and the money that we're spending to a crackdown on illegal immigration\nOr they were the people who are here no matter what it costs\nWell about no matter what it costs I mean obviously you have to do a a a comparison but I live in a state where immigration is out of control and it had killed that said they said in California is the richest and the poor state all at the same time in the country and that is\nNot only because it's not all immigration spell it that's really left leaning\nProgressive if you will whatever we want to call it policy that has kind of taking the the path of socialism and has provided the end to the middle class in California or at least the the\nI guess maybe the destruction of the middle class in California but what took it down that path is that nothing was functioning at schools that were over on you at hospitals that were override your to taxpayer money going in to pay for stuff and it just wasn't enough because the amount of people using it were and it would not being covered by the taxpayers in the state so\nI when you see how it has affected California education were forty seven in the nation when it comes to schools in California\nIt's a combination of not having the resources to pay for the onset of people at all so\nThat people are coming here and putting their kids in school or not learning English as their first language or sorry is their second language and that put the kids at a really bad\nIt starts them at a slow pace it puts them at at a disadvantage so when you see not only the social but the economic dangers of having immigration that's out of control I say yes ultimately it is worse because the problems in California are going to seep are already starting to see each other state in ... in the in the country so\nI'm looking at the debt I cover this about once a month sometimes maybe more frequently by the new info the federal debt last month\nOr through last month Cisco two thousand Eighteen this'll has to\nKnow it was October it starts to reverse oh this is the total federal debt last year increased by one trillion two hundred Seventy one billion one hundred fifty million one hundred sixty seven thousand one hundred and twenty six dollars and Seventy two cents\nYou know this is one thing where I get absolutely crazy as a as a Republican and having the Republicans in charge the house in the Senate\nAnd having Trump than the White House the thing that drives me nuts is that no one with the exception I think of Paul Ryan has the backbone to accept tackle cutting the debt the only person that you that you hear other than Trump sometimes on the campaign trail is Paul Ryan talking about cutting entitlement because it's not pretty people are going to like it but\nAt some point we're going to have to do that because the bulk of the money that we're spending is on entitlement programs it not in the military it's not an all of these other areas that keep the country running it's on people getting money from the government\nWe have to take that somebody's going to have\nTo run on saying look this country needs a diet it's not going to be easy but it tells you know gather in trying to be better absolutely\nSo this is the eighth year in a row which the debt has increased by one trillion dollars we owe now the United states of America in debt Twenty one free in five hundred sixteen billion fifty eight million\nOne hundred eighty three thousand one hundred thirty dollars ... it's many numbers asinine it's craziness it's it's a what it is a suicidal\nSuicidal\nAnd nobody pays any attention the economy is great bunker him\nWell the economy is great but you know what will make it the country healthier and on this give US law and the longevity is\nMake is using this great economy to say okay now we need to cut back a little bit how people get wealthy if you are individually trying to you if you make a little money from the stock market you don't just go out and spend it no you just cut back a little more and you spend a little invest a little more and then all of a sudden you're doing really well but it might hurt in in the

not I'm not sure but I just put this post out their welcome back every one I'm from the vice mayor ... except for the flag\nThe U.S flag as her profile pick hung upside down\nAnd I don't know it's got me lo fired up you know because she says she is in dire distressing that happened to go up\nThe same day that I'm a judge and now justice\nKavanaugh or got voted in so I put that up a talk with Jeff dot com and I would like you to share that so go to talk with Jeff dot com and share those posts but I did get a response from somebody named Jim Jeff come on enough with the fake outrage I guess I have faith that fake outrage\nOr remember there's such a thing as free speech in this country I didn't say you couldn't do it I just said it's stupid to do it\nI didn't say you couldn't do it but there is a flag code and you're only supposed to do it in ... you know extreme distress like your ship is thinking\nAnd it's interesting I'm not going to read the rest of it 'cause he be Babylon for a while but it's interesting I was watching the HBO mini series the Pacific\nAnd I just finished up last night so this is real timely\nI and I see this this morning the flagging out but but anyway I was watching and you know you you ... these people that sacrificed so much American Soldiers so many of them died and they go up a mountain and talking to a gym and they place that flag I mean what would they think I'm sure you can do it Jim\nI don't see vice mayors and other cities hanging their flags upside down or and I see that in Flagstaff I don't see other cities struggling with what potentially will be the highest minimum wage in the nation right it's heading\nTo where it would be a Fifteen dollars and fifty cents would be the highest minimum wage in the nation higher than New York city higher than San Francisco\nAnd you know either I saw a great sign the other day you know don't California Arizona and it's exactly what needs to be said over and over again we're not telephone you ah Arizona Flagstaff not San Francisco LA\nAnd we don't have the resources that they have financially but we have the resources that they don't have in in a natural beauty beautiful blend in our people\nAnd I were trip I wouldn't trade those for the world but we can't do what they're trying to do and we're even seeing in California it's not working\nYeah yeah yeah yeah you could run the gamut of the issues and then come over here and let's try it over here because it maybe we're going to have better results were not\nA so this is on the ballot people get to vote for who are in the city of ... states watching the nation's watching 'em and we'll see what the outcome is but there's been a lot of stories out there about the negative impacts\nOf this high wage right now and we're not even there when I fear most like is\nI don't want another recession but sickly speaking these things happen and I'm worried that read about when we're getting us Thirteen fourteen Fifteen an hour it tax and then all of a sudden employers are like scratching our heads how do I keep these folks and employees are like\nHey where's my ... hours being cut her head we could be heading that way you\nWas raised in a mission them and which from two thousand six to two thousand twelve was the hardest hit state in the country and I lived in a\n... a tourism town in a town where tourism is the only thing that keeps it alive and from two thousand six to two thousand nine there wasn't tourism and you saw\nBusiness after business close yeah and if we keep going and we keep pricing are locals out of our mom and pop smell shops yeah and the small businesses then they're going to be dependent only on our tourism and then all of a sudden if a bubble word a burst they'd be in the world of hurt\nA ... my guess he's with us on for Eighteen and it's interesting because I saw a tweet\nFrom the Coconino county elections office and there was a big push yesterday was yesterday was the last day to register correct yeah yesterday was yes okay well that's it you're it's done it's closed up like yesterday less they but they did a they got what seven hundred and fifty voter registration new registrations in one day explain that a little bit yeah so yesterday\nGroups whether it's our campaign or do you know Mitt salaries campaign but we'll go Republican Party the local Democrats\nThe Democrats socialists the no campaign everybody was pushing for people that they thought would support them to register to vote and ... and make sure that they were all set up\nAnd then you have obviously a lot of new college students and there was a huge push to register them and so this is you know a lot of these are first time voter registrations and\nAnd so it's a record and I'm all about getting more and more people to vote I think that the higher or better voter turnout is the better um but you know seven hundred and fifty one is a huge number especially\nIn the county like hours yeah yeah it's it's a it's a it's a big number so I I guess the question is when I talk about the students influence\nOn the community to like Flagstaff or Tucson where there's ... there's there's a big and growing university where a lot of kids come in since the kids I said a lot of students come in\nOr all the time and they come from a lot of other towns other states but then they register to vote and what does that influence I still look back on two thousand and sixteen when proposition ... this wage issue passed and I wonder how many students influenced that\nWhen you have tens of thousands of students in a community of sixty five thousand uh but but you have a ... a Lauren Bradley's come in with you and she's actually a an innate you soon\nYes I'm a senior any currently let me ask you this so you were here for the last um election when this wage issue was voted on how did you vote\nSo I was a freshman and I'm actually from Las Vegas Nevada so it was my first election ever voting and coming into Flagstaff I saw that oh ... for fourteen like minimum wage is going to go out and as a freshman at living on campus\nI wasn't currently working but in the future I knew how to be getting a job so seeing now I was like wow like I totally am gonna vote for that and yet those for it voted for it to pass what\nDid you okay it was your first election where you were Nineteen\nYeah science team okay so you're Nineteen at a time your your freshman you said you're in a new town you're out of your home town you out of your home a first time voting and you see this yeah I'm going to make I can make more because you're probably working for minimum wage it's I'm just making a lot of sense you know where are you working for minimum wage at the time\nUm I wasn't working I had been working at minimum wage back in Las Vegas and then in Flagstaff I was just it was a freshman year like I was living on campus likely to just not doing anything but focus on my studies\nOkay but you vote on this thing and it's like hey we're gonna raise this up because like stuff is coming from Vegas it is a much higher cost of living for some folks who come to you from California it's like well this is cheaper right I'm even without a state tuition but for you it was more expensive correct\nYeah and living off campus in an apartment this year and actually having a job now I've realized how expensive it is to live in Flagstaff and it's actually almost sixteen ... percent more expensive in Flagstaff than Las Vegas\nWell okay so your vote for this thing uh and it passes and it's the Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage did you think was there any I mean I'm just trying to get into the mines that there's no inflation or you know thinking oh this was just going to cause inflation is that it's that wasn't going through\nNo I mean I was super naive like year college wasn't really thing about that all like my parents were still supporting everything so now that I can see that it's actually affecting not just the people in the businesses than just a living wage for me even to get ran or to buy groceries and anything I Do in Flagstaff\nOkay so fast forward a and folks we're talking with Lauren Bradley who's a senior at any you and like over who's a yet with the yes on for Eighteen fast forward well not even two years read to you fast forward two years and\nYou're seeing the impacts now there's a new initiative on the ballot a prop fourteen what's changed I assume you're supportive and fourteen yes I Am okay why\nI'm supportive of it because when I came back to fly south in August I knew I had to get a job because I was paying for my apartment I was taking classes at any you and I really had to start planning for myself\nSo I started searching for a job and I already knew that the jobs were very slim in Flagstaff just because it is a small community and a lot of people stayed over summer to work\nBut my friend ... she actually could not get a job all summer and how to move back home because she couldn't afford to live in Flagstaff without a job so when I came up here I started applying online and all around and I could not get a job that to me about like three weeks to find something\nNot what's after applying online going in with resumes and all that so that's when I started to realize that people are not hiring even though they need the help because they are not going to be able to afford it [noise]\nLet me ask you this are you an oddity or you just is this a rarity among um now you're a senior so you're here for that last election and like I said fuss for two years but however there's a whole crop of new freshman sophomore who weren't here for that process\nAre you hearing any shot or I mean is what is is your position I rare position among students\nI don't think so I think with us seniors and the older ones that we've been there for both of them I think we realized that Flagstaff is expensive to live in and to be in but I think definitely the freshman incoming I don't think they're paying attention to that because like I said when you live on campus during the bubble yeah see I'm not paying attention to it\nBut when you get older and you start realizing\nPeople aren't going to be able to get jobs in that they do get jobs it's just not going to be the same because there is not going to be as many hours to get out anyways uh\nBlake let me ask you this because my my point being that you have a whole new group of folks have a place like the university has targeted numbers have grown even further so there's more ...\nThis folks here who when this was voted on they were living in who knows where California Illinois Phoenix and they were ... Fifteen sixteen Seventeen at the time they didn't know me feel old yeah yeah right I mean\nBut how does that kind of foreshadowing what's coming because how you get to those folks because they may be in the same place that that Lauren or was that and she's seen it differently now but but how do you convince us younger folks\nEducation or the great thing though as soon as that are going to enter you are smart kids and I'll let you at home tips for some reason\nFor you it's just a matter of fact [laughter] ... young very\nBut and so there are striving to learn ... educate themselves\nAnd so we have students on campus we have a recent graduates that are working with the campaign or volunteering with the campaign\nThat or just go in and ... and working to educate voters on campus or we have a great relationship with very student groups on campus and we're going to be doing a a a tale day before the election okay almost literally to educate voters on this issue and other issues that are on the ballot\nAnd I and what we have seen this is more that young people and the more anybody but specifically young people the more that they realize what's going on and and what actually is determines the", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "10"}
