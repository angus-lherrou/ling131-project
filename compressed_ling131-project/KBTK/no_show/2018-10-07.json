they're fascinating and I try to go into an open mind and I try to use science and look you know look at it from a critical thinking folk or point of view\nAnd so one took part of the answer question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that oh look and it goes again\nAll right [laughter] they're like we're gonna we're gonna go to the beach and like that's really cool I gather the monster there so I'm Wondering over there and people taking photos and so\nThat that that's part of it is I've

example I was in Finland or about ten years ago\nI was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking ice birds and the reason that I went there was because ah there's been a series of lobsters of the washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or wherever they are they washed up there but I wanted to go investigate some of that in the oval Spring Hill jak signing up there but I thought it was up there I came across um a a place called lake craftsman\nUm and it's this little young for land it's beautiful it's just you know it just grab and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake marks of there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot\nA metal sculptor thing this thing as you enter the town and the count of the population is like three or four or something\n[laughter] to the car I'm like I\nPut on the break but I got a [noise] I I Can't pass a lake monstercom on site and you know my friend rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\n[laughter] well it's better than stopping for the biggest you know world's biggest a ball of yarn or something like that right that's right I'm with you [laughter]\nThat's great stuff okay so I'm I'm before I go on you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween so I I Googled that bone found your article that you've written 'cause you you do a lot of writing your author of course\nBut you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry\nYou do a lot of writing your and author of course that you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too but\nI saw this crane article for a meal and I was like oh my gosh here's the game you know and salt looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody who was writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so\nSo tell me about the origins now we're ... we're just now learning the Oregon Zimbalist wean the Gallup the origins of the Halloween\nThe the ... I I I Want a two hundred years from now when people are researching the oranges will if when they're going to come up with\nThis conversation I'll love it my grandkids will be be all over it they'll be like that I Know you're\nOne of the things that I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not big on the on the holidays meaning of Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists gets all the the the conservative sometimes get all touchy about that 'cause they think it's really the the\nThe cult which is not but it's it's what it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into and that's where I really love about Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy as a fascinating history\nI'm so basically Halloween\nA ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of full Couric\nGays and events and holidays there is not just one street line back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime but basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic or deal it festival called a slow in [noise]\nAh and ah we don't we don't have that much information about just because it was that it was so long ago and there is no the film\nRecords are pretty sparse fragmentary but it's basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest and it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the solstice ... and it's a time when I'm you know the the snow's falling and you know plants are dying\nUm so it had this connection to ah to darkness but it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we can we think we think of the darkness as being you know something faster but to them it was very it was ...\nAn analyst point of view it wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons\nUm and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so it wasn't scary it was like yes the time to you know to store it rains and to you know give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this and that [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the um uh the the the separation between the world's with especially thin porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry folk or what have you there in the world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day the the the er the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise]\nUm and so this is why uh the the began talking about how\nSpirits would ah would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to uh see spirits and they were basically all around us and it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world's were porous um you know the barrier between them but also\nI'm In a leader incarnations of Halloween it was also that uh time it's porous and so what you find is that a pool would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when\nI Would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's ... there's other worlds but it's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different customs that would involve the Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them but there were ideas for example that the that are for example woman born a Halloween would be able to tell the future\nUm and there would be the prophecy and often times the prophecy a was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so is it ... you know oftentimes there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would be would a white a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look look in the mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection [noise]\nUm and so all these sorts of another one example was a bombing for Apple's you know if you're down near the apple bobbing and there was there was a particular Halloween tradition\nThat if you cut a pie appeal than apple in one long continuous strip unbroken and he tossed it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell out the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and past and present coming together\nWho am I going to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] actually I Do it and do it at midnight right on\nMy willfully night that's right will swing and [laughter] well what\nAre you may you may have your own little um\nI'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to you know I\nI get there are people that say Halloween oh same same thing in and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um you know\nI always see it is fun I see it and uh\nI I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to me I think a small whether I think an orange and black collars yeah I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which isn't the goblins\nAnd the theory fun fun things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it in the tradition down at it in and uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're going to have to take a break here\nBut what we have is Dan rapper with\nUs he is an investigator and and into all the things that were into a as because the folks here\nEight hundred two nine six Thirteen twenty five that's eight hundred two nine six one three to five Ninety seven when the\nCoast to coast more stimulating song\n\nWelcome back because because I Am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis ... talking with Ben ran for then sell as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get ... can get kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that kind of Halloween and that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me thinking you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal\nLike Superman or something like that they can do that anytime of the year\nYou know the the any creativity to go to target and put on you know a Batman asking me make make something out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do up you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love it all\nAbsolutely no I mean that's that's one of the you know that that's really what's associate of course these days um although your Halloween was never really mainly a children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids' kid centered as it is today a it was more of a community thing again sort of if you go back to go back to solve when and the the the early\nA Celtic versions of it which were very and the mystic and and again sort of dealing with the changing of the season and darkness and snow and all that [noise]\nUm but you know so you you had that and then that sort of what happened was that\nUm that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know obviously the next day which was to honor that the church a church members who have gone to heaven and then also got wrapped up\nTo a whole day which is November second which bills are wrong for the folding purgatory\nAnd so there was this there were it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan I'm a ritual of which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that\nAnd then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with all things that you know all day and\nAnd again they were bringing a bells and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away or demons and scary things could loud noise we're such a scare away the evil [noise] um and that's where it transforms little later on into the modern costumes because what what happened is\nI'm a you know we're talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that a ... believe that a drink so and the leaders would where animals skins I'm there and sometimes the animal heads like handlers and whatnot during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm but then later on during the late Eighteen at least some hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food um to the poor during Halloween praying for the dead and this again the ties back into all day because the idea was that\nUm that on that day or the soul of the word predatory you know they were they were basically trapped between heaven and hell the needs to be prayer prayed for\nA and so the the wealthy members of the communities would basically\nA higher out there were ... sub contract the prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people will go from house to house asking for what were called for cakes where which type of bread and in return for paying for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and song rituals\nAre going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn up of course that would later translate into uh the the the the uh the public and um but the ...\nCandle Atlanta the candle in it and the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for\nThe idea was that they were these members go out for house to house so you know yes will prefer if you're a member of your family who's a who's passed on I'm with you know holding up this this turn up with a candle and I think of this light as for the soul which wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nThe turn of sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if\nYou ask me to read one when the pumpkins came in because the pumpkin associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and associate with the harvest and that's that sort of how the the trick or treating after I came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn to now move on [laughter]\nTrick or treating aspect came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn to now move on [laughter] ... little olive oil some pepper um so where do you think candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in is that like right after the ... like you were talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean if it ... it was interesting because it because again the sort of the things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what would happen is um that if you think about it you know again that was the the mom and going on this and that and\nThen uh the the during this time of the the jitters had pretty strict social roles and so um and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween was a time when when young girls would\nWould would pining away with ... think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably three or four teeth at the time and knows\nBecause that's what they did\nUm but you know that that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like during this time this is when people would go from house to house look into the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nYou would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era so if that was typically sort of a young man's you know ... him Mr this young man's project in the the the girls and women would tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing\nAnd rituals in terms of you know the process of those sorts of things so so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know ... as the as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean there were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold in purgatory [laughter] that's a little less a little a little outlandish for for a little too much work for these days\nSo that's when this sort of came down to treats or and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid a not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a member of you know every now I get to get a silver dollar or are you sometimes you get an apple you're like really\nReally only a capital\nOkay and I like it was it wasn't even that I like it was like some relief tart apple was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple didn't I didn't say that I'm like you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go a long time ago it was great you remember the good house together since they were there were years where you get full size candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that'll\nHaunted house record where you heard the ... which is right and it was very dark so if you if you rent if you were brave enough to go to our house you would get full size bars you know marathon bar and you get a handful you're\nThe only ... I Love that I Love the marathon bars but they were all and chocolate and they've they're like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're just great harm those I I haven't heard anybody mentioned those in decades\nOh that's a horrible ... you got a full on you got a phone line is you can't replace\nA wish I'd been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those any more of those were fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and and we had to go kind of far up one hill this way money all the other way and you had your son that's when they had those nasty math that you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time [laughter]\nBut we were there was no one else at all you had homemade popcorn balls they were delicious it was the only time we ever had on there were awesome and you know back then you could trust the people\nAnd then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house that there were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes like we don't want to go there you know thank you yeah trick or treat thank you [laughter]\nI should mention that because of all three answers the the the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the classic a poison ... and the reason the yeah\nHave been more gang majestic arguably the original often imitate it never do that no that is now open late in the center\nIt's the majestic marketplace community calendar learn a bit of Prescott historic past and present with the press get historic downtown walking tours Fridays and Saturdays and Sundays studying ten am through the month of\nOctober ... downtown Flagstaff is a free weekly social ... brings adults families together in a vibrant event and activity every Wednesday starting vices cesium in heritage square through October the just the marketplace\nDJ ...

something yeah and the ruler on the back oh man I I mean anything Googled after we're done here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face was last year for McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably watch in the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way Yeah Yup yup yup\nNever on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on there now are\nSo well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the teacher in the same panic part and all that good stuff\nNow another element in some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into\nYou know the um um\nHouses down the street that nobody the abandoned homes or ban in hospitals and things like that and they go inside these places and they use the energy board on Halloween Night or they or they use now all these different devices\nTo call upon spirits and goes now you have you in Britain quite a few books actually and you do a lot of writing and oh my gosh good for you I I just ... and that's why I like to talk\nFor a social life I'll just say that all I Do like your\nLips your latest book is about goes hunting and investigating what to look for what to do and also um what it used to be like in the past and what the difference is now I ... I found it\nInteresting that you had said to me on that people will go into cemeteries and they'll ask to talk to a spirit where ... years back people would get why why would you want to talk to\nA stranger you know maybe call upon your family members somebody now and that's true why do you now\nKnow that was that was that was one of the things that I ah when I was researching my book are investigating goes to those\nIs basically a survey of of the scientific attempts to to contact the dead I'm ranging from basically pre history a but primarily through the the the Victorian era upper upper two days you know ghost hunters and all that\nAnd what you find is that the the idea that\nI mean you know people have been talking if it did for millennia I mean that's you know there's references in which of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know your lady Macbeth I mean banquet so there's there's there's there there's no shortage of go in and literature and history but you know typically\nGo were or if it's typically if people if you want to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you'd be talking to 'em your your your great grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently hum and the the idea that somebody would go into like\nGrandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently um and the the idea that somebody would go into like a haunted house whether it's the Myrtle plantation or a year the Wally house or you know what what have you go to a hundred location and\nTalk to some random spirit that just happens to be there and say Hi can you give us inside and you don't know me but\nMe about yourself that that's that's a that's a relatively new phenomena hum and it's it's fast and you know you go back to look at the the\nThe ... that were held in in the Victorian era off in upper class uh places and they would have you know a ladies they they've Crumpet some tea and and the and you know they try to communicate with the ghosts and then\nYou would have the the spiritual era [noise] um and you had people like Harry Houdini friend research the Marjorie ... and all these spiritual is to you know came to the states and Kate Maggie Fox and and and they're you know their\nTheir stuff and so and then Harry Price and his researching all that and then you sort of fast forward to\nUh the the the ... the idea and you know the electronic voice phenomena and the idea that you can record you communicate with ghosts or through white noise and fruit basically a broken radio that switches channels and then you sort of fast forward to\nTo the more modern day ghost wonders with the the TV shows and all the spin offs and goes inventors and all that and it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of these sorts of things and look through techniques have been tried and and you know what works and what doesn't and and how do we know\nYeah I Need to get a you know it's already kind of creepy and spooky enough for even scary enough when I Do get some sort of interaction when you are going to try to talk to spirit is\nUm it's it's scary when you get somebody talking to you but\nPeople take that step further\nAnd they hope in ... and you don't know who they're poking at ... I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction you don't you don't know if that's going to be somebody nice or not end on these things go wrong with you you know that's where\nI grew up in a hunted how high is the last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer ... or looking up in the sky line I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um and you talked about exercises and things like that one of my friends aren't they should change along it changes like you know folks click provoking clip provoking you don't know who\nOr what you're talking to and that's what they were there with that\nI said you're not doing yourself and your favorite thereby proclaim whatever may be there\nRight you don't know what it is it the evil or not evil or what it is that All right I mean\nUm you you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that same typically\nWell there there's a couple of things you know one of the first things you do is um you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes investigations myself\nUm and as I said I I come to a more science based or someone say skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I dismissed everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe\nAnywhere you sound as that goes in so [noise] so that the first thing that I Do want to go into a case is try to establish a water the false viable claims that is what exactly is being claimed you know if someone saying that there's\nThere's a mysterious sound or a laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what what exactly is is is going on there and then the question is can we tested is it repeatable right is it\nIs it is the sound that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the ghost hunting you see on TV\nUh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality t._v.\nAnd ... the reality\nYou know in in scare quotes um and I and I've I've been on many of the TV shows as you pointed out I was a so I've I've done you know on both sides of the camera on this\nAnd you know and my my point of view is always\nYou know I I don't make fun of go because I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do that do it right you know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem that I often see\nIs that go centers on TV you and and not actually just across the board is is are you in the supply us even you know amateur groups across the country is they typically engaged in what's called the anomaly hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know you mess or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops whatever it is and they're ... they're they're sampling the environment looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these reading and walk around all ... sorts of things\nAnd then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and\nThey try and look for anything we're all look at this at at three oh eight PM I Am you know we saw this thing and the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate\nThe original claims they're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talk to an eye witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are you need to investigate those particular claims and and oftentimes that sort of gets ... pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to\nYou know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the infrared cameras on and we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part of part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that that in almost all cases they don't\nThey don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see a ghost hundred go into the location maybe there's team of them\nAnd they'll they'll take readings for three hours or six hours or wherever else and then they'll go home and analyze them the problem is that's not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um\nWas he talks infrequent help line now eight hundred two nine six one three to five to eight hundred too nice one three to five that's even two nine six Thirteen twenty five\nDoes your dog each

[noise]\nMore stimulating thought Ninety seven point one the big doctor\n\nIt's caused because day in tiny will is here\nWill is wean is what's going on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford he also is an investigator and mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating dose and it's um\nIt's very interesting book it talks about ah well let's let's bring him back on year then we were talking about how you investigating how you first go in it to an area where somebody says there's these things happening and I mean here's a question\nThat I Want to know that I really don't know and a lot of people I don't think they have any clue either but everybody tries to be cool you know um when you look at a picture of photographs\nAnd someone says this is talk and you know some there's a lot of really great people out there that they really had things happening and they have great pictures impossibly something\nAnd I love that I mean we all want that but then there are some people out there that want to thank things so when you do see a picture\nHow do you know what his photo shop what is not photo shop what might just be a glitch\n... might be a maybe a light\nReflecting off or the difference between an orbit and he said gosh how the analyzing of photos tell us about that\nYeah I Know that's that's a good question and I have to say that that um you know I I've I've probably looked at two or three hundred and photographs or over the years that people have sent me I'm I'm a same with the triple Garber on the on the default recipient of\nA trip recover photos [laughter] usually mean dogs in Texas but I I have to clean up to them afterwards\nAnd I I have to say that I've rarely encountered hoaxes hum I have on occasion but I Would say probably Seventy to eighty percent of the the the goes photos of them sent our our ... by some fear or people who just photographs something weird and they yeah\nThey're not lying there not a hoax who met not pulling over on me they're like hey can I call him\nThey're just like hey this is weird you know can you can you help me figure this out [noise]\nUm and so you know I ... I go into each case um you know trying to you figure it out and to help them as best I can and so one of the things that I encourage them to do and I I Can't always do this myself because you know I I if if someone sent me a photograph I Can't just drop what I'm doing fly off to you know\nTo Denver says [laughter] researcher go sort of like why not [laughter] because I haven't trademark we lift Wayne and gotten as often [laughter]\nJust split it with me that's all I ask you\nKnow but it's um so so there's a couple of things one of them is is I Want one possible I Try to go to the the location or was filmed and try and figure it out so you mentioned earlier um one case that I'm known for which is the famous courthouse coast case\nThat happened about I don't know maybe ten years or so ago and it was in in Santa Fe New Mexico the capital a which is about an hour north of here\nAnd it was a video taken outside of a a courthouse and it was a really strange glowing orb thing that they crossed this is real and camera [noise] um\nAnd it was you know it was it was seen by deputy uh so you know that they're\nProbably [laughter] that would that make that gave them credibility right it's a deputy and the court of cameras though the likelihood of\nBeing a hoax was dropped off considerably at that point um but what I ended up doing was I went to him I said the story um it was made national news and people are all this weird thing over and\nBecause I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I I went up there and investigate it and I I went and I went to the courthouse I looked at the camera and I talked with the deputies interviewed people\nAnd I had some ideas of what it might be\nUm and I did some experiments I eventually you solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the video or the photograph and you try to figure out what or alternative explanations right so I\nUsually I make a list of\nThree four or five different things you know could be could it be an insect could it be hulk could be a ghost as there are some I mean so you just basically any\nAnything that is even remotely possible I Try and lift those and I try to rank them terms of what most likely which which things can I find that at least test where things can actually you know investigating falsify\n'em and you just basically go down left and and that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the imports\nFalsify 'em and you just basically go down list and and that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the important uh and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's\nThe photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell they came from [noise] but but when possible it's good to try and replicate it so you for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood\nAnd I said you know a ... are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was a sort of image does he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well again it's it would be I could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back in different states but I said\nYou know if you if you do go back there if you were still there go back and tried to replicate it you know take take take the photograph\nAt the same place ideally at the same time of day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might might be might be mistaken for a ... a an image of a face or something\nI sell ... and I get that I get that and\nYou know I guess that that thing whatever that might be just they're like you said and it might be people might think\nWell I'll give you another example of what\nI was gonna say one of it is um you know if it's on the one question comes up as the other people see it right and so this is right there is often the case of\nWhere you know there's there's an extra for example behind standing behind somebody a and actually I I was sent to an example this a couple of months back and they said oh this was the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there's this sort of weird goes the image or just behind her to the left\nUm you what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of ... you know it's hard to beat conclusive about it\nWithout more information but\nI noticed that no one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who are you or nearby and no one is looking to see you know strange image to their left and so that suggests that that they probably didn't see the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI got ya I got you and you know it's it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see what the I in some things are picked up from a certain angle and not another angle um they just\nYou know there's some things that are seen that he just\nThe way the shadow is in just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked out that that can mean it looks like there's no way it could be anything else but something creepy or you know we're the\nSame place was hunting for sure you talk about uh goes hunting equipment man has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work\nAnd and by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking to measure that that we can't measure right now it's all new science you know\nWell yeah I mean you know one of the interesting aspects of ghost investigation is um is the uh you know of of for example I was I was doing a TV show called the mystery request a while back and I was there with them a ghost hunters and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted placed there and\nAnd they live on all this all these are the gross telling the equipment and just you know there's cameras and ... there's always like you know probably Seventy thousand dollars with the gear\nAnd it was all set up and the cameras and lights and I are all that sort of thing and and I talked to one of the guys who brought all that stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera I mean I ... this was in like a gotcha moment we're just hanging out with were finished shooting or going back and tell us and I said why do you think\nHave rather mountain living

look\nYou can't just give ... edition because it's tradition there's many traditions that should be abolished war we're okay for a time because of some sort of continued see or something that was going on and that has since changed\nBut the traditions are there to show the process\n\nThat process that took you from point a to point B\n\nAnd you should should uh you've reference to that process but never let it impede on the growth of the church I see so many stubborn church leaders\nThat don't want to reach out\n\nTo the community or to the young people because they it's like that's not how we did it that's not how it was when I grew up well things change\nThings change\nOr we may remember a Native American who called the program and maybe you remember as well some years ago a sweet sweet man called up and said that that he wanted to speak out Christianity that he was curious\nBut then we against the traditions of his people\nAnd I asked him how many rooms were in his TV and he paused didn't and replied uh I I don't\nSleep in a gp I said why not it is a tradition\nAnd you see the\nThe Native American people slept in the peace because that was an efficient way then not now\nCulture that's been the traditions culture in tradition both come from this supply and demand\nA need\nOn a scouting around the area seeing what you have supply wise to fill that need and filling that neat that's why when you look at certain regional foods they're based on the on the supplies that they had a hand\nNow the tradition is passed down and it's wonderful and say this is what we cook but as things change and import and export and all these things\nSo keen culture change hope you're supposed to change and so our traditions Mm\nWell I won't back down a\nYou can stand me up at the

discipline you in the way they see fit and that is okay I wouldn't always agree there are many\nGroups churches that X communicator kick people out for reasons I think are asinine but that they go into it knowing that that's the I see this in Catholicism a lot a\nLot of people say I'm a Catholic but I don't believe X Y and Z and it's like well that's not really fair because that's what ... is if you just don't want to drop the name ... um 'cause you're attached to it\nThen you know say I'm a social Catholic or something or use a model fire otherwise it's not fair to the church they are trying to keep a belief system\nAlive and they're the ones that are allowed to make the rules\nAnd you can either be a part of it or not be a part of it\nBut when you kind of try and be a part of it and then go buy your own rules and the church\nHas the right to say by we don't we don't want you are involved with us\n\nGreg welcome to the Jesus Christ show\nFirst of all thank you very much for taking my call I appreciate oh my pleasure and how can I help yeah Frank I have a question and I got a second part of that question first of all I Would like to know who the holy ghost is\nAnd is it true that the holy ghost is the body Jesus is a heart and the brain is God\nNo ah that is a\nAt best that is something called a an economic trinity that's when somebody tries to make an analogy or for people to understand the trinity in a way that is in the physical realm or things like that and what\nHappens is it breaks down because it's that that's not the case now it may help people understand well uh you know this is kind of the positioning and how they work but the reality is they're they're all equal\nNow your heart your body and your mind are all equal in the sense that you can't live with one or or the other they all have to be tied to one another so there are parts of that analogy that that might run or has some lengths to him but ultimately when you start breaking it down it doesn't make sense because the\nUm because of the positions being different doesn't mean that the substance is different so the Holy Spirit is the third person of the trinity and\nThe Holy Spirit has very specific a duty is if you will and responsibilities and focus but as far as being equal with the father and the sun\nScripture says absolutely Matthew twenty Nineteen second Corinthians Thirteen fourteen the Holy Spirit is equal with the father and the sun\nThe Holy Spirit was there at creation the Holy Spirit was there at every major event it's not like oh well the Holy Spirit we don't really need him right now but the\n... the position the focus of the Holy Spirit or is it specific just like\nI'm the son and just like the father have specific thing\nThings that are done so it's always spirit a gave Christians gifts or whether prophecy healing miracles 'em\nI said when I departed the Holy Spirit is going to come and dwell on union if every believer Holy Spirit referred to as the comforter or the helper and so the way some people describe it\nThe logically to kind of wrap your mind around it is the Holy Spirit brings you to me I bring you to the father so there's that\nUh that process\nThat moves you forward and in position that essentially the Holy Spirit is that experiential side to your face here on earth\nBut it's got one hundred percent and even in that concept saying it's it's a heat it'd be a have the same way you would refer to me as a he or to the father is he not because of gender\nBut because of the uh terms that are used in scripture so it is a person the person to the Holy Spirit\nAnd people get confused because fathers son and you can persona fi but Holy Spirit seems ambiguous and kind of cereal and floating in all of those things but the Holy Spirit is a person that you're a person of the trinity the third person of the trinity\nNot the body\nOr was there were explaining that way to me I I think that my understanding\nIt's it's a weird that the trinity is complicated in some ways because it's not something it's not something that that you can put in a box the same way and although there are things you can look at on earth\n\nIt's not something that that you can put in a box the same way and although there are things you can look at on earth\nThat point to the concept of a trinity or one thing in three nature's there's something called the triple point of water where I'm at one point one moment water is solid liquid and in gas forum\nAnd there are there's the concept of time time is one thing each time\nA in three yesterday today and tomorrow or past present and future you can't separate them\nOr you can use the clock to try and do that or you can use the sun rises and goes down but really you're not separating time because it's different other people and you could change o'clock you put more hours on it if you want to do or you could do whatever you want doesn't change time time is what it is it simultaneously three and simultaneously one\nBut it doesn't mean that it's easy for some reason though it's one of the attributes of God that everybody gets stuck on yet there are\nAll kinds of attributes of God nobody understands like omniscient ... or ... or any beyond the attributes being everywhere wants knowing everything you can't comprehend that either\nBut it is what it is\nAnd that's what separates God and in the case of the holy trinity there is something special in the Christian belief system because you're dealing with one God\nIn three persons in this case the Holy Spirit ... role\nIn the in the entire dance is to blue\nAnd to comfort\nAnd to bring you into the understanding of the sun which is the bridge between the sin of mankind to bring them back to the father but because the father and the sun are such human\nAnalogs you look back and you okay that makes sense it's people put those into categories very simply mean when you get the Holy Spirit people uh it over complicated because what's the Holy Spirit I Know what a father is and it was sunny but technically the father's not a father\nThe way you think the father is in the sun is not a sun the way you think your son is except\nIn the physical sense to marry\nSo I Know it gets a cup getting weird but it's not really something you'll ever truly understand\nUm but it's not something that should be putting a box that well it's the body and and the heart is the sun and the mind is God that's sort of just pointing at the positions and things are on there to do list I suppose that we have to do every single day\n\n[noise]\n\nPressure will return in a moment\nTo be a part of a show called the seven seven dollars\nThat for a year that is a question not one journalistic outfit made my

mascot again because I Want you to really get a hold of this why is living a life of faith so difficult [noise]\nWhy is there a problem\nRomans chapter aid for seven cents at the center for mind or their carnal mind that the ... mind the earthly mind is hostile to God it it does not want to submit it to God you see me because of sin we want to do our own thing\nBut the opposite I made a way where there seems to be no way God said it'd be a little trust me it was all a very hard\nAnd lean not your own understanding he wouldn't make our path strain you see in the problem is is our minds are hostile to God so what do we have to do we\nHave to the trust and the law was all of our heart and lean not to our own understanding that harbors chapter three ... you see most have\nA tendency to believe only what they understand [noise] let me let me say that again most have a tendency to only believe they understand see as we shared earlier from that and that is wonderful movie miracle on thirty fourth street\nFaith is believing even or the common sense tells you not to\nAs I just said most heavily the tendency to only believe what they understand yet throughout God's word we've been told that if we wouldn't just leave gone would give us understanding yet I've heard people say over the years God if you will show me a miracle I Believe\nWill God's response has always been very simple if you believe I'll show you may recall let's look back at at Hebrew chapter eleven verse three is says my faith we understand\nMy faith we understand\nPeople sit back and say well everything was created\nAn ad on my shoulders of the big bang theory or the universe just happened well the Bible says my faith we understand that and God formed in the universe and had his command\nEverything that is seen is made from ... which is not seen so let me ask you what\nDoes it really mean to believe what doesn't really mean to believe you see there's a word\nThat is anonymous with the belief and that word is trust [noise] well another word with is synonymous with trust is the word faith when you were in God's word\nIn the Greek and language disorder belief trust and faith all come from the same record so when you say you believe that means you trust when you say you trust that means you have safe when you say you have to face that means you believe\nI remember many many years ago in World War two there was a there was a a an overpass that a lot of the a lot of the uh military the soldiers would hide under our ... and covered under\nDuring the the onslaught and found under this overpass where some very poignant words that were written by a soldier and I can almost picture that soldier being there possibly that\nStarted last night or a star Phil Knight or horror with all of the different things that were going on around them when this a soldier and these wars\nI Believe in the sun even when it's not shining I Believe in love even when I feel it not and I believe in God even when he is silent\nFolks the Bible says and he was chapter eleven versus one now face is being sure of what I Hope for all the ladies and gentlemen to live a life of faith means to live a life that is governed by divine persuasion faith\nIs always a gift from God it is never something that you and I can reduce within ourselves we cannot conjure it often and just say well I'm just going to believe I'm just going to know it is something that you're gone gives us the Romans the Bible tells us he\nGives the measure of faith to every one that believes in short what am I Sam said for the believer is God's design persuasion\nIs very this thing from human belief even confidence though is involving confidence\nLord continuously Burris face\nAnd he didn't believe her so that they can know what he prefers literally yielding to the persuasion of his will\nLoad a citizen first John testify versus three and four loving God means keeping his commandments and his commandments to listen to this are not burdensome\nBut every child oh God this thesis evil world and we are the ... tree how\nThrough our face let me taking\nA second Corinthians channel five or six to ten says therefore will always be confident and no but as long as we're home in the body\nWhere if the lord for we live in my face and a science\nSo we make it our goal who the scripture goes on to say we make it our goal to please him so whether we're at home and the\nBody or away from it\nAnd then the scripture conservatives here in in the second Corinthians Jeff ... says for we all most of the year before the judge must see the Christ\nSo that each of us may receive the do for the things we've done while we're in this body whether good or\nBad so you see that picture it says that we walked in my face and not my site we live with the goal of policing him sent us knowing that one day we're going to give a count for our life\nAnd you can't read people's minds but the last time I had a Senator Flake on this show he was battling conscious of the conservative so lesson had him on I'm\nNot just ain't quite frankly I just think call after that I just couldn't do it I was just on 'em but what's going on here I mean you have everybody knows this is going to be you've been in politics for a little while I was in the city council and and you always know when you put out a position you're the uninsured guy named forty seven others\nAre or forty eight are like no I I'm good I'm voting for Kavanaugh\nAnd three are the I'm sure once they got to know they've been in this long enough Collins and Murkowski that that they're going to get clobbered then there's gonna be protests like they weren't sat in front and center flakes office in Phoenix yesterday um why did they do this what what where do you think Senator Flake is going to be our our senator from Arizona well here's the deal\nOr you you mentioned it earlier is that you have to be a hundred percent with these people or otherwise are never your friend so Murkowski and and and a flake or an Collins these people are not ever going to be your friends I mean look John McCain look at the experiment called John McCain\nYou know when he ran for president he was shredded by the progress is by the Democrats are definitely yep but once he dies he he was a thorn in the Republican all were in ... he he's a stand up kind of guy but they're never going to be your friend\nSo if you're thinking about one winning an election or running for an election you need your base\nAnd so you better make that make them happy and you better make the constitution happy and you better make sure that the rule of law is is held that standard and we've been going two hundred and forty years and it's been a success story\nBut we're person who's right we're we're we're turning a corner yeah I really do last week ago right we could stay or the strongest place in the world but if we don't have the rule of law it didn't take very long before those lights are out yet rule of law overall of\nMan somebody just deciding yep this is this what we're doing today yeah that's why we have that piece of paper now eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety someone here with Congressman Paul ghosts are a lot of folks want to change it on I've seen it here in northern Arizona\nUm sometimes I Wonder you know my listeners who are in other cities in Prescott and and very valley in wherever I talk about ... because I see the stuff happening here that we see and the other big cities the San Francisco and New York's but there's there's been this push\nA to change the ... they want to change the constitution in particular they want to have the open border they won't people flooding over\nThere's been this push we've got one councilmember here in Flagstaff or they just want to have put several shows up in a meeting on a diet there with the sign that says a hash tag abolish ice [laughter] God David Garcia is running for governor guy he's ... on that bandwagon as far as I Know is well\nThere's a lot there's folks in that that\nAre in Congress no yeah I'm sure Oh absolutely what's what's the plan here what I mean what are they thinking\nAnd also where are we in transition to the border\nWhere are we with our border where he was born in ... I I take a counter step but obviously they don't care about the safety of the American people because\nIce intersects a tons of of illegal drugs I got one of my ... no I mean right now what they've done with that no illegal Fenton along on the streets could kill hundreds of thousands in close to a million people with what they've confiscated\nAnd obviously they don't care about human trafficking and women chopping particularly women and children obviously they don't they don't care about that either because I says one of the premier interceptors of of a trafficking human human ... ah people\nThat's the problem is is you know once again it comes back to a ... a verse that I go I memorized and it was from Louis Brandeis soon as an associate a Supreme Court justice a government of laws is imperiled if it doesn't hold the laws ... oppose\nAlong scrupulously it if it doesn't it empowers every man to be a law breaker invites anarchy here's our sign I mean this is the ... that you know a clip from the blue comedy tour\nLuther George Soros is pouring money in this country for the anarchy he was saying one world government\nSo I mean folks I mean this this is here right now in here\nAnd it is on our door steps and evil prevails when good people do nothing that is the ...\nThat is the key scary times it's scary times and I think you're right around that corner it's scary times but you know what I'm a our freedoms and liberties are not free we have to fight for them day in and day out\nUnless they give a little bit away we we will we will be hoping again a Ronald Reagan said that light on the on the hill so you don't get it back you don't get it but you don't get it back now I mean and so from that standpoint the other thing I offer is is when you haven't turned yet we're going down the road there's less there is a right\nBut we do in this election will set us on a trajectory\nWe're empowered as voters we are empowered as citizens to be well educated to me first if if you want the Soviet style\nGovernments is ... owns all his all and you know if it does everything you'd be holding the government welcome to victimization 'cause that's what the other side once\nI'm not for that I Want people to be empowered when people in power they strive for great things they accomplished the impossible\nAnd I was talking about just some of the things with the uh climate change plan and there was all kinds of things in there talking about central planning ... and he will do that hey you shouldn't even me it basically said he grains and things like that but it I was talking to diet and three o'clock hour\nBecause there's folks that really want to dictate every aspect of your life and it's really too bad but the elections coming up\nAnd I think that this is going to be huge I'm a huge check in as to what that silent kind of majorities thinking the folks that put Trump into office or we're going to find out\nIt means huge I'm a huge check you know to what a silent gonna majorities thinking the folks up put Trump in office or we're going to find out because the early ... you're going out I Believe next Wednesday folks are going to start getting rebels Thursday Friday and and then we'll know here in the next couple of weeks\n... what are those people that aren't the ones protesting in the middle day like today in front of the Supreme Court that ... you know the folks that are working homo or doctors exactly you're making Social Security and Medicare is in the\nCountry great so when we come back I Want to talk about the election coming up\nA plus I Want to talk about just kind of makes the viciousness and you've had some personal experience with that um and many people have solved this in this nation especially um since Trump's been elected so we're going to talk about that and we will take comments eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety several one back in a minute [noise]\nThe show Monday through friday to review on Sunday seven boys one of the doctor [noise]\n... do the best of the ...\nYou're going to we're Jeff lived\nThere for you on buddy seven Ford won the big talker and I do want to welcome the Coconino county treasurer Sarah Benetton how you doing today\nI'm doing well how are you good served ...

founder of for a financial group they serve families across northern Arizona\nYou can learn more online ad vora financial dot com that's Bora V. as in Victor ... are a financial dot com ... saw a survey were Twenty one percent of people surveyed say they're very confident and they're going to live comfortably through retirement what do you make of that number\nYou know what congratulations to that twenty ... percent you know these are the people that are meticulous and how they manage their finances right mhm and uh their confidence in what they're doing but you know you know what I look at this but I go let's talk to the\nSeventy nine percent that aren't confident because you know we want to really help the masses here in in giving them some good advice some foundation and to how to plan for retirement and he'd like pre planned for retirement and\nWhat to do in retirement because today's show is going to be\nListen to the show we always try to be creative about talking about different things\nAnd I think the Seventy nine percent is who I Am really wanting to talk to today because I think I've got some great information but I'm sure the Twenty one can also twenty percent of people that are confident and the reason we found that there was a small group of people that have confidence in what's going on with their retirement\nBecause these are the folks that have put in the time to understand how to do things correctly and they've hired an adviser earlier in their career or earlier and started a you know putting money away little at a time\nAnd I was talking about you know we talked about do you know how you feel a bucket full of water\nHow drop at a time\nOne little thing I'm a little bit of time right and so I think a lot of people are looking at the big the bucket and go wow how am I going to fill the bucket\nBut it's done systematically and it's done with the intention so you know it's it's a very easy process if you give it time so you know I always talked about you know I'm a procrastinator wins\nAnd stuff you know especially if it has to do with manual labor yeah and ah you know I just moved I sold my house and I moved into another house that I own\nAnd I literally I didn't have time to get to the move and so when I started packing him and I had a deadline and you know I really did it to myself I put myself under so much pressure\nTo get everything done within a short period of time\nWhere I you know if I had the time I could have taken the time\nAnd done it systematically over a period of time where I was not stressing myself out so this is how I see people deal with retirement you know they're trying to feel that you haul with all their stuff\nIn a matter of five years when they had a you know twenty five or thirty year career would they could have done it a little at a time and they could have really approached this in a very systematic and stress free manner so that's where we want to really talk about is how to take stress out of your life\nAnd if it's stress free is happy you know so\nThis is the retirements roadmap show on the retirement networks [noise]\nWe're back thanks for joining us today on their retirement roadmap show powered by vora financial grill I'm generally that alongside ... more I eat owner and founder of more financial group dates are families across northern Arizona\nYou can find them online ad vora financial dot com that is vora V. as in Victor Oh our a financial dot com\nGarnish during our working years if we want to reduce our income taxes one way to do that it can make less income but what are some strategies for raising taxes in retirement\nYet you know reducing your income would be great just go talk to your employer and telling me on a pay cut they arrange it should definitely arrange it you know\nBut that's not realistic for anyone and so you know here's what we figure it out is I've been doing taxpayer with my clients for years now and what we found is that people that understand or are working with advisors that understand how to help them manage their taxes\nThe ones going to pay less to the government and I would rather if I was you know if I was your advisor\nWouldn't you want me to make sure they keep more money for yourself scoring giving it to the government because you know what government's not going to send you a little thank you carve a Christmas card a birthday card saying hey you know a great job they use all this money right so tax planning is really really critical because lots of people\nDon't understand or or they haven't looked at I should say don't understand is that what you don't know you really don't know and so when we started doing planning with our clients you know what we're trying to help them understand is that here's how much money you're making and as\nYears become you'll probably make more money because of your pay raises and so forth\nBut how do you keep more money for yourself and and if we can divert some of that money to go into your retirement account or have more money go into some tax favored investment strategies you're that's where you're going to you know really create wealth\nBecause if you keep giving it away you're not going to have any for yourself because the government is going to be getting all your money\nAnd also understanding you know how the current tax law works and I think the new tax law those past I've been doing a lot of work shop at you know I'm the different uh community colleges throughout um northern Arizona\nOn retirement and taxes\nAnd it's interesting when I have people in those rooms and I ask questions about what do you think of the current tax law\nA quite a few people says I don't know and some people say well you know Trump passage there's gotta be\nPatients are not for us here's the thing I really don't care what the president and so you know this is not about you know political this is about the law the new tax laws in place you know we want to do is really understand it and\nUtilize it so that we can put more money in our pocket you know rather than give it to the government and if it's used correctly or in your finances you can actually save a lot of money on taxes and so what I've been doing is I've been talking about taxes in retirement\nAnd showing them all the opportunities there right there for us\nAnd most people aren't taking advantage of I Would say even one tenth\nOf one percent of the strategies and the new tax law because they don't know about it\nAnd a lot of their advisors don't know about it because most advisor said well you know I help you manage your money but taxes not really or a cup of tea will you know when you do comprehensive planning that's what we'll we were able to help people so that's one portion of it right\nThe other thing is a lot of people that are thinking about retirement or getting very very close or like ready to make some big decisions in their retirement such as Social Security\nWhat we're finding is that most people have no idea\nWhat is the best strategy for them I've had people say well you know we don't live very long you know family or I don't anticipate live very long so I'm going to take my money out a way to start taking money from Social Security so they can get their money out of it\nBut the reality is people are living in a lot longer modern medicine has come leaps and bounds from you know even five years ago or you know live on ten years ago right and and so a lot of things are changing for uh some people are living longer\nPeople eat a lot more useful today than you know they've ever been and and you know I'm Talking to my clients in their sixties and seventies and eighties\nAnd the eighties is a new sixties in the sixties you in the new forties you know my ... and think about it like if you look at your friends or your your family members and you go\nWow you know somebody's like Seventy Seventy five years old and you go well you're supposed to be this active you know because it's statistically you know I go back Twenty years\nPeople in their seventies they're like well our lives almost over you know my clients in the eighties are booking your vacations five years out and you know if you if you look around if you listen to the show you know people that are older but\nUseful I mean there are more active today than ever been and you know which is fantastic\nBut the downside to that is that people are going to live so long that they need the money to last a lifetime and without a plan\nThey're going to go go through that money and to me that's a significant concern when you don't planning\nAnd understanding how much money you're going to take out in retirement so one of the strategies is maximizing your Social Security benefit ... and how to get the most out of Social Security\nAnd that's one source of income in retirement there was actually a survey that was done by transfer America\nAnd this was done about a year ago and they said the fifty one percent of baby boomer\nFeel that they're building a strong enough nest egg ... percent fifty one percent right which is great you know what I mean which is good to see that people are excited and they are involved and so forth but you know here's really something we also have to look at you know what has the\nUh the temperament or the the weather has been in the in the stock market over the last ten years right\nAnd we've had a ten year old bull market after the market correction in you know seven or eight the markets have been going up and we're almost a decade of fantastic I mean we've had ups and downs I mean it was a straight line up\nBut you can have peaks and valleys and all that stuff\nBut we've had a bull market at the end of the day you know bull market me in some markets have been going up and bear market is markets are going down and said a lot of times be confused that so I Want to clarify that sort of bull market I mean the market's going up\nSo if you're in a strong market conditions in your portfolio have been growing and you've been taking risks with your portfolio\nAnd of course you're going to feel confident and I'm not minimizing what trans America saying but what I'm wanting to people to\nWhat I what I Want people to start thinking about\nIs that you know when we were kids we used to love to play with pendulum and you know we had pendulum ... the one with the little metal thing with like about six or seven\nLittle metal balls that you know you know which one I'm Talking about right now you're on your desk yeah right so I was talking about pendulum either because the analogy goes when the market's going up the pendulum swinging one way mhm and you know and everybody's making money everybody's happy the real estate prices are going up and all that\nBut when the pendulum starts ringing the other way\nAnd the more people I talked to are more concerned because the markets are hitting new highs\nAnd what happens what is your strategy if it goes the other way\nAnd if you're taking more risk than you should or if you do not have a strategy\nTo deal with the next market correction what's going to happen to let's talk about the fifty one percent of people that are feeling very confident that they have a strong mistake when the pendulum goes the other way and if they're not prepared\nTo step out of the way they're going to that pendulum going to basically turn into a wrecking ball\nGoing through their portfolio and you know like every market conditions that we've had a you know like every market correction W had not only A People's investment accounts had lost about fifty percent of the value of the account\nBut on the other hand you know people that own real estate such as primary home or rental properties are the real estate investments\nAll those properties or down about half\nSo overnight you wake up and you're half what you were wow you know gather sanding it is devastating and I think you know if anybody knows\nAnyone that was thinking about retirement back in Nineteen Ninety nine two thousand two thousand one or also a again and it was seven or eight if they're planning on retiring or they're retired\nAnd they have to depend on that money for as part of their retirement income retirement pot\nAnd if they will continue taking the money out are based on their lifestyle they are sure to run out of money so preservation risk is good risk is healthy but preservation strategies are extremely important in any kind of planning to to figure out that\nIt's nine to eight two to six talk and I will give you this book for absolutely free and one thing I'll ask you to do is once you read the book I Would love for you to pass it on to somebody else I could benefit from that so it's my gift to you\nAnd your gift to somebody else because I think if we can all kinds of seeing choir sheet and keep more money for ourselves that's what we want to do you know government will always make more money because they're all those people out there making all this tax mistakes and let them pay the taxes we shouldn't\nTalking today with a guy made sure he has owner and founder of ... financial group that phone number one more time if you said nine too late to care sick eighty two fifty five or nine to ... to sex talk\n... worse than other things need to think about when we are looking at our tax situation and the taxes we might be facing in retirement\nBecause one of the things I talked earlier in the show was required minimum distribution mhm so are empty a requirement distribution comes with significant amount of penalties for not taking enough money out of that plan so for example most people think that you have to be Seventy in half and you have what's called a mandatory distribution\nBut one of the things I'm also starting to see is that people are inheriting money\nFrom their sibling from their friends from their parents\nAnd what they're doing is they're inheriting retirement accounts and if you inherit an IRA and\nYou could do two things one cash without pay the tax will be done with it but most people are going to do that if it's a large chunk of money because that's a pretty significant tax right mhm yeah what you should be doing\nIs making that an inherited IRA meaning that the\nIrish stays a as an IRA but what you're supposed to do is take out what's referred to as a required minimum distribution for\nInherited the IRA and winning inherit that IRA you\nRegardless your age so you could be Fifteen Years old you inherit an IRA from a parent or grandparent you're supposed to take out a distribution out of that I write in your Fifteen Years old and if you don't just want I don't know big penalty\nSydney now yeah I could you not there is a fifty percent penalty on the monies that you did not take out of the ... not ... fifty correct Pfizer fifty\nSo you know because most people are taught that you cannot take any money out of the IRA account until you're fifty nine and a half years old\nAnd you know so what happens with inherited I ... I just I I the reason I tell you all those stories are on the show is because this is actually stuff that I've seen happen\nAnd so what happens here is if you don't take money out you have a fifty percent penalty retirement accounts ... when you turned Seventy in half and so if you have your own retirement account not inherited but your own retirement account\nAnd and when he turned Seventy and a half you're supposed to take a distribution of from eight Seventy and half\nAnd moving forward for the rest of your life\nSo let's talk about you this you know we talked about the powers your book so what happens\nThat most Americans haven't thought this thing that far out so what happens is when you get when you retire let's say you're getting a income from Social Security and you just happen to be one of those lucky people that actually also has pension and that's enough money for you to last you know to live off of\nAnd now he took Seventy and a half and the government says Gen you have to take more money out of this plane mhm\nAnd so you do you're required minimum distribution like I said if you don't you pay the rent is going to do it right you can do it right\nAnd as you get older what happens you life expectancy get shorter and as a life expectancy you know according to the chart get shorter meaning the government wants to take more\nAnd more and more money out of your retirement account so what is the end result the end result is that not only you're having to deplete your retirement account but you're getting pushed into a higher tax bracket number one and the

maybe dumping they're a\nPart of fuel or whatever they do they land you know\nYou think they're flushing the bathrooms on your roof there I don't know what to do and listen uh let me ask you a question\nFor you but this roof on did you take the ...\nOh yes of course okay\nNow I'm the old rules did\nHave any ... not really now is your home shady uh yeah there's some shade or in front of the house yeah you get more strict on the front of the I\nGuess you'll notice that in the front of a little bit right right like above the entrance of the door you know but I got like a a body shape how a typo so\nOne in thinking here is that typically the area where the roof rafter touches the roost she right\nWhere the would basically isn't solid contact\nThat's the coolest spot than the average they're right and left of it so sometimes when we get these strikes on the roof it's a condition called ... and it's because you get more conversation\nOr in the areas that are cold near his dinner warms the left and right and then now also on the shady side of the house or wherever you have shade you're also much more likely to pick up a little algae or like in March\nAnd that can also cause standing on the roof\nSo before we jump to conclusions what I Would suggest you do is use a very simple approach is a roof clear out there that's called spray and forget it's available and ready to use bottled you basically just snap a hose and garden hose onto\nAnd then you could spray the roof down and just kind of walk away and see what happens I actually haven't had an extremely dirty shed roof\nThat has so much moss on it and it was crazy 'cause it just hadn't done anything wrong time so so last summer when I was\nPainting the fence and doing the repairs outside of decided that we take care of that and I got the springs forget and put it on once and then I walked away for about a month\nKnows that almost all that was going to put it on one more time and it's perfectly clean and put it down doesn't happen instantly because basically what it does it stops the gross for me to give it in a sort of a weed killers moss\nAnd it brightens the roof and then there's a residual stays on it and kind of protection will also I Would try a product like that it's very simple fairly inexpensive and see if that doesn't pay and then if it does and you kinda know what you're dealing with\nUm one natural thing that you can do to ... though that group down to teach me try to get a little more sunlight on that area sometimes I've told books a traumatic trees and and that's should just no way on

been better off just having a pro come in because they can buy stuff that you can't buy plus they're specifically trained on where to put the insecticide how much to put\nAnd also the insecticides they're very specific and they were moving to the insects that they're supposed to remove and they don't remove the beneficial insects that you want to leave behind so if you're having that much of an infestation\nI Would stop shopping round pesticide and call a pro and have them treat the house and once you get the populations down to where they are manageable kind of more normal than you could try to use some of those other products just on a maintenance faces that makes sense\nBut here's that here than the question when everybody else it had the same problem on the mall it's all ... entire
