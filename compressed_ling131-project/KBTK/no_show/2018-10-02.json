I think are a lot of personality types I ... I had women teachers I mailed to drive more women teachers probably than I did male teachers but I had some great men teachers that I still love so much and I still keep touch it keep in touch with on Facebook it's all about for me if someone who just talk to kids like\nA person I I think when teachers tried to um\nTo teach above the heads of their students that's when I think they lost a lot of people I loved it when a teacher could make something relevant with something that was either\nGoing on in our lives in our school maybe something we'd heard about the news when teachers made things relevant and told us why they were important those are always the one sort of I kind of ...\nSkin on religion that sort of carry what about you\nYeah I'm trying to think back and I feel like a kind of agreeing with Jen that my favorite teachers in classes now there first of all based on the subject though I Would probably never going to like a teacher if it was the subject that I really dislike there wasn't a way that I think teachers can always do\nA better job at at getting kids invested in those subjects that they're not interested in but they're never going to be my favorite teacher\nAnd the teachers I did really love really went above and beyond that to try and relate to the students and make things exciting and make them\nUnderstand it and make it make them want to be involved in it in a way that was beyond like oh well that's the history of the I don't know European kings and stuff like that like\nYou have to make it personal to you and I I'm sure that there is way more to that's when it comes to what to do well and what students too bad what district that then how much money the kids have at home with their parents are at home reading with them so I think it's much more complex issue\nI think the teacher thing is interesting but I I I think it's important that we just encourage more and more people to go into teaching because I think we're kind of at a place where\nThere is not a lot of money to be offered that it's a lot of hours you're working with people and kids who\nAre not necessarily in great places and don't necessarily respecting so I think a lot of people aren't going into teaching and I think we need to figure out a way to get more and more people into teaching\nThat illusion\nObservation yeah All right but back to you and your days in school to whom did you well that's what I'm saying\nIs it's not really I I don't have a specific you don't have a little I'm not like only white women I mean one of my ...\nName or a class or a year round school one of\nFavorite teachers with my sign language teacher she was a white woman but it was a very um\nExperience though we were not allowed to talk at all in that class we were only doing signing with that I feel like I learned some of the most important like I I learned so much in that class and I take the class\nUm well I thought it was interesting my one of my older sisters had taken the class a few times and she minored in depth study it's when she was in college and sell you know me being the youngest sister I'm always kind of interested in what my older sister did and I took it and it was so fun I'm much more of a visual learner and I learned by doing things and so\nI take in France for years I was never super great at it because we just kind of went through a vocabulary list and that was not fun to me but when you're in a class and you're using your hands and you're communicating that way that was\nReally fun and I thought the teacher taught it in a great way she was a white woman I don't know if that influence it at all I think it was her personality and the way she chose to teach it\nBut then I had a lot of male teachers for English and history and math and I really liked them as well so I I don't really see it as a gender divide unfortunately a lot of my teachers were white I didn't have a lot of teachers who weren't white so I Can't really speak\nOn that even in college she didn't lose your professors are usually a much more diverse group yeah I'm trying to find their way or maybe I just didn't really love any of my college classes that my [laughter] 'cause none of them are really coming to mind my favorite team or were so high school and\nI'm thinking about as you said that uh my favorite I had three or four process in college that I really liked\nAnd we're friends with when I was there and and one of them I didn't wasn't able to keep up with because he was killed or he was in Iraqi named movie dean at war and he taught to political science at every course that he offered a he was a mess [laughter]\nSome Muslim guy came discovery went to northwestern get a doctorate there ended up in Heidelberg in the middle of nowhere in Ohio married\nTo a Southern Baptist it will out most interesting I was just amazing and he went back to fight against Saddam Hussein and was killed\nBut he he was his family he came from the era before her uh Hussein or the era of um of kings and queens in princes and and he was the son of a prince\nAnd a man that's how he was able to get out of Iraq and go to northwestern to get an education\nAnd he just said here and then this country became such a mess he went back to try to ah work under if you will under the guise of or some other you know he he went back to teach so he said but he didn't really go back to college he went back to try to disrupt\nWith Saddam was doing and he was not successful but that's a name and a face in an\nExperience I never met a moslem before in my life for God's sakes I'm from Framingham, Massachusetts and where's the moslem within a hundred miles of here when I was a kid growing up plenty him around now\nBut then no and I didn't even pay any attention because I've never been much ... and it was to school and I went to was supposedly\nBased on Christian tradition a and was affiliated with the United church of Christ and yet here's this Muslim guy who shows up\nA who that people find fat of the girls loved him and he had no idea that that was what he had no sense of anything except his job\nAnd his country he paid no attention to his wife had a couple of kids that were running around all over the place of but he understood because we grew up in a family of forty\nForty siblings 'cause his father had eight wives and [laughter] and

side there's a dark side there's a dark side take social media and the Internet before that existed journalists had a stranglehold on the mass flow of information and opinion\nIf you wanted to have a voice you had to go through your local newspaper your local news cable news national publications like the New York times\nYour voice really the only place your voice could be heard in the past was on

feed ... let me give me an example New York times\nEmily bad luck on July night she tweeted quote\nAs a Yale School as a Yale Law school graduate at a lecture I strongly disassociate myself\nFrom ... praise of Brett Kavanaugh with respect he's a fifth vote to the hard right turn on voting rights and so much more that will harm the Democratic process and prevent a more equal society\nOkay so in July she came out and she let everybody know I'm against him\nI think he's dangerous now that was just three months ago she exercised her ability as we all do to to share with the world what our opinions are\nAnd then yesterday she shared with the world her independence or independent viewpoint Emily exercise\nThe or other platforms she has the New York times with a holy crap bombshell on Brett Kavanaugh and I hope you're buckled in\nFor this or is this in the early the allegations\nAre horrifying you'd ask yourself what could be worse than attempted rape Glenn well gang rape yeah but what could be worse than gang rape\nWell here we go\nEmily in the New York times reported that in September of Nineteen eighty five Brett Kavanaugh\n[noise]\nThrough glass of ice it somebody yes yes\nShiites so so you've got you've got Michaeline you could select him let's just say Brett Kavanaugh's hit by a plane tomorrow which I wouldn't\nDreams accident but it could happen and it happened in Indiana Jones or and and and ... one of them are the guy who they were fighting on the ... yeah I mean was turning on if that happens to Kevin\nWell this one they won't be delivering the arc in that plane they'll be delivering a the New York times are playing but anyway so let's just say\nAnd it makes them into sausage ... uh\nYou need to announce that Mike Lee is the candidate we're going to have this done by the election there of course going to go crazy because Mike Lee is ... pro life uh and he would vote\nFor him in the bottom line is he cares about the constitution anything\nI mean he will vote he will vote the constitution and he will also vote for right of life he's not going to go in there with an agenda but he is a right to life guy so Kevin I wasn't good enough here's Mike Lee there's not going to be there is no drinking parties would likely there's just no drinking but maybe and then it'll be like Mike is like\nAll right I Confess I I tasted beer in Nineteen eighty three I didn't really like it when I tried it wasn't root beer have you lived in a so anyway\nHe's the only one that you could push through because if you don't if you don't have a plan immediately then the Democratic plan works of delay\nYet that and that's the most important point their strategy is not to say that\nKavanaugh is a sexual abusers their strategy is not to say anything about Kavanaugh specifically their strategies to delayed this thing so they can get to the election and if they get past the new Senate coming in\nThey can potentially have a chance of stopping now if you were to the day after the um the did after this\nGoes down God Forbid there have you know would they find something terrorists have let's say if they find something terrible man right and everybody agrees and it goes down eighty to twenty right like it's just one of those things they found something terrible though about Kavanaugh we don't think that's going to happen however you must be prepared for that potentially out if you have to be ready for it\nAnd if a ... if you tried to go down and then the other suggested road who we talked a little bit about yesterday\nWhich was you know a Diane Sykes or you know an Alison either one of the other will make it to January ... ... you could potentially have enough time before the seat the Senate\nBut I mean it's going to be really close and you might not make it really is the only thing you'd have that you'd have be able to get that through fascinating also is the guy that everybody in the Senate has to look at it after they voted against\nI mean they will vote against the Democrats will still do it but we'll\nJeff Flake vote against you know a highly I don't think so would a I think so you know I mean you know I don't know have good really\nSo they'll do it but we'll we'll Jeff Flake vote against you know a highly I don't think so would a I think so you know I mean you know I don't know have good relationships with

where I'm wrong tell me how this is going to end in a you know in a positive way I I I think though that we should also get into a movie to this beforehand get into the idea that there are accusations that Kevin all light in his hearing\nYeah and you know the New York times laid them out\nIn ridiculous detail yeah and we should go through each one of them because I I Would like because there's an idea that if there is let's say he perjured himself which is one of the things a lot of people are starting to throw around now they're starting to say well he perjured himself he lie isn't saying he was trying to paint and stuff and the best possible\nIt was he perjured himself that maybe he did I don't know I mean I haven't seen any perjury about sex doesn't matter we forgot about that yeah um but ... ...\nIf he perjured himself look he we perjured himself for me it's a problem yeah\nI I mean to me it would it would matter on the context of it I guess I I I mean if what do you mean like the booth thing like one of the things we're talking about it the\nAh but ah I looked it up in the Urban Dictionary okay okay so there is this guy I mean this is as close as you can come yeah like a founding document of the word booth\nYeah this is like if you go back to the federalist papers out yet very Urban Dictionary [laughter] okay so this is a the Urban Dictionary right to abuse any list it's or illicit substance via insertion into one's rectum\nThat the number one meaning but that's the number one I have never heard of that\nBought funneling oh now I Do I get ... technical terms I don't know who says\nYou know what a bad is better if we drink beer through our bought\nBought apparently that's been done a [laughter] I\nDidn't I didn't know you kind of I Know you could do that either is it and I don't recommend and it's not called really drinking if you do it that way not just really learning here ... no I don't know if you're\nIf you have bought blackouts if you know when you're but also as you are or not or okay okay so there's a there's the there's the the number one a ... or the next one is something that is whack\nDumb\nOr F up use to describe objects people or stuff you don't want to do that like\nA you know that guy is a booth yeah that I feel like that's maybe also how I heard it now that you're saying it that way because it's\nJust kinda like an insult yeah that may have been yeah\nRight I just know I I remember the word but I don't remember and connected to you know sticking things in [laughter] anyway ah here's one that kinda makes me feel a little better a synonym for weed\nYeah so how would it is their sentences smelled use it in a sentence place smell that booth [laughter] now I assume that ... you're saying yeah smells that boom yeah yeah yeah it makes me feel uncomfortable fit\nThe active lifting the uh the bow out of a whitewater kayak well going over rocks waves are waterfalls like uh in order to launch over hydraulics or rocks\nThis entry sponsored by could bellows yeah than what I've never heard that before\nI Move the low tones noise a dog me okay typically when they are suspicious or unsure of whether they should actually bark or not\nI haven't heard a flatulence one but I have heard many things related to the ...\nUh which I think somewhat another term for having sex it that'd be in the bud Bob\nBut he's OK so again [laughter] I think this is the interesting point here they're trying to say this is essentially perjury\nThere's no way that perjury to me that if they bunkers claim the idea that they were probably meant different things to different schools at as mine and yours did right as there are seven different definitions on Urban Dictionary for it now not just because flatulence didn't make it there does not mean that low locally that was not the way people used it but you do have the\nProblem of people in Georgetown Prep\nNow starting to come out and saying look I I was for him and I don't think he did this Ford thing but now that he was saying that this is what these words mean come on man and and that he was never really fall down drunk yeah\nOkay well do you have that one too you want to go to that acts as a\nAgain the lists of potential perjury or from for judge Kavanaugh um the next one is excessive drinking judge Kavanaugh portrayed himself in his testimony is enjoying a beer or two in in high school and it's a college student but not as someone who often drink to excess during those years I drink beer with my friends and\nUm then this is disputed as what they say in the times his statements are odd at a uh with some of his classmates and how they remembered him nearly\nA dozen college classmates have judge Kavanaugh said they recalled or him indulging in heavy drinking some saying so now it's not it's less than a dozen 'cause some of them said I'm drinking some saying a it was a beyond normal consumption ... parents that are going to be sure a smaller number of classmates that his drinking was unacceptable\nSo again this is like\nJudging yourself and how much you drink is notoriously difficult as I Would assume Mr alcoholic over here will be able to tell you\nOr I mean the whole point is the toughest thing to do is admit you're an alcoholic right yeah it's very possible and I would say likely that most people who drink to excess in these period would not necessarily say that they're doing something abnormal\nEven if they are here's what I here's how I take this I took that testimony what I watched him talk about drinking it was very clear that he was getting drunk and and he said\nLook we drank drank the athlete drink to excess we all\nDid have you done that I mean I ... the on the drinking thing I don't consider this a problem because I\nI Believe that he was in effect saying\nYeah but there is a difference between a blackout mhm gay\nAnd maybe he had blackouts and didn't remember them I don't believe that at all you have a

deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gotten the damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want or expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case\nUm was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen\nAnd then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nWill the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mr Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't short short herself civil is Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that should go away and this one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News any more if they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate the stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nWell even the Democrats um declined to fully embrace the Julie sweat next story\nBut on the original story that Christine for a story I think what we're going to find and what we're already finding um is that the people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like PJ Smith and mark judge amazingly enough\nThey're telling the FBI the same thing they told Judiciary Committee which they have no memory at all to support this now I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections\nOr you're not remember a Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big\nDeal with this party entry and the Brett Kavanaugh calendar July first Nineteen eighty two thirty six years in three months ago by the way um\nAnd it listed who is that the party and it didn't match up with a with Christine foreign to counter this but they thought this was a big deal so let's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that that I think there are three\nAdditional people calm Bernie and squeeze\nA who had not been interviewed earlier a and I think you're going to find three more people who don't know anything about a Christine ports are allegations so\nUh I listen I I I don't think this FBI thing FBI investigation is a bad thing I think that they will find out\nUm but there is no evidence to support this and they did find out actual real evidence to support it then I\nChanged my mind but I don't think it's there well\nIf you go through I I thought it was really devastating new report by Rachel Mitchell um now he's the independent prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes and she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be\nExtremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so they brought in an independent prosecutor to to question professor Ford who showed incredible respect on her\nBut she pointed out of he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove itself and then she goes on this cases even weaker than that\nAnd then she Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues there was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault\nHappened I mean the dates keeps shifting back and forth dramatically actually the failure to previously identified judge Kavanaugh's the assailant\nAre inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember key details who invited forward to the party how did you get to the party where did the party even take place how did you get home from the party\nUm and and it goes on from there but every case is similar in as much as there is no cooperation their big holes in the stories and at some point when do we ask is this becoming a witch hunt we know that Deborah cats as a friend sending out emails\nAnd she's a woman that went after Paula Jones and supported Al Franken so she's not exactly\nConsistent on the issue of of sexual misconduct\nAnd they're sending out letters to here so and so do you know anything please call us and you know those letters when ours\n[laughter] I Know please some core operation you know the ... case right here at times they said they called they talked to dozens of people not to me that says twenty four people or more I mean that is a lot of people can look at it on on the Rachel ritual thing\nYou know she was a lot of criticism of her and um I think that that the way she approached it was not a really good way given the limitations of a Senate hearing where they had to be interrupted every five minutes but she did\nIt listed a lot of information I was looking today at her questioning of a Ford\nAbout her therapist and the therapist notes and the white we even know about this because remember\nFord says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty thirty six years to two thousand twelve and she ... she says she's in marriage therapy with her husband and she tells\nThe therapist about that and she later also tells an individual therapist about that as well and she checks the therapists notes and the therapist notes do not mention the name Brett Kavanaugh and she says as a matter of fact it's only her husband Rick\nShe brought up Brett Kavanaugh saying\nThat you're the only evidence that it took place in the therapy sessions and by the way you would think such therapy sessions and the ... there are would be confidential but of course she gave them to the Washington Post so they're probably no longer a confidential ... even even her account of how she finally\nMentioned it to someone after thirty six years raises a lot of questions\nIt really is amazing now we have Judiciary Committee Democrats now they're wanting to investigate the quote ice throwing incident in college you know this is what it's our primary because\nYou're on the trigger but that's what they say well now we have the Democratic hope uh Hawaii\nSenator the one that said to men to just shut up and sit down and Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants an investigation into the ice throwing incident\nI'm at a ballgame and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity about was he truthful about is drinking he said he lives here he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college and high school kids I drink too much fear\nBut they said well he must have blacked out in this event um nobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said that somebody I blacked out\nCorrect so did you become a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him so here's ... question right go ahead where we're told us that things have changed\nFrom an emphasis on me or to sex misconduct allegations who wants to be truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact that there really isn't any evidence to support the sex\nOr allegations and now they're\nTalking about whether he told the truth about drinking ... mentioned\nMany times in his testimony\nThat you get 'em in fact drink today rocks published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking tricare mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr as I got to let it

he's ... he just I mean he ... with us all last week that he not\nWell I think ... you know and that's another thing well he doesn't have the temperament now if you if you're accused of gang rape and accused of sexual assault\nAnd you're innocent how was the what is the proper way to act was he supposed to be monotone\nOf guys I didn't do this or just not true I mean because as his wife is crying behind him as his daughter is saying to him pray for this woman and it ... it right innocent\nAnd the half the country and these people they don't care they don't care who they destroy in the process of accumulating power\nAnd honestly it doesn't matter what he would have done it wasn't going to be the right thing and\nI and I believe it that didn't even have to be Kavanaugh could have been anybody this is much bigger it's about than stopping the Supreme Court\nConfirmation that's what it's all about they're willing to do anything to stop it and these liberal women these he kept wearing liberal women out there speaking like they speak for all women they don't they absolutely do not end when the\nPress in the media and the the leftist obsessed about women this um this cycle we're just not going to sit back and take it we are the ones for sixty ... since the Nineteen sixties women have been fighting the vote\nWomen were the ones that don't like the Donald Trump's women are the ones that are going to decide what happens in the in the mid term and we're going to be the ones that decide what happened and twenty twenty and conservative women are kinda that\nTogether and we're pushing back on all of this and say they don't speak for us and we stand with Brett Kavanaugh I mean we're not going to back down and let and let them win this absolutely no way\nWell it's going to be up to three senators probably Jeff Flake snowflake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and then it's going to be whether or not the ... whether or not I love the Senate's going to hold a vote and a

admits that he drank he liked to drink he drinks beers still likes to drink beer sometimes drink more beers that he should have drink and then people say what he must have black now we know that he's a liar he's a perjure right and now they want to investigate in the eye throwing incident at some game\nYou know back thirty five years ago this is how absurd this has gotten\nWell I Can't tell you what I was doing thirty six years ago but I can tell you what we're doing it two days and that is we're having a when the ... or first ever conference here in Washington DC it's women for America first heels on clots off\nAnd women from across the country are coming together and we're going to spend three or four days together and talk about why we love this country and we're going to be bold and are supported the\nPresident and Brett Kavanaugh and on Thursday we're taking a little trip to the U.S Capitol while the others are camped out at their most conservatives are working but we're going to take a truck and visit some of the senators and let them do how we feel about it and encourage them to vote\n'em to support to confer Brett Kavanaugh we need to do this and I'm hoping that Mitch McConnell brings this vote on Thursday it we're having our first event Thursday night and it would be great to be able to celebrate the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh um women for Trump at our conference\nWell I Want to see what happens we'll know a lot more by the end of the week we may even no I'm I'm hearing rumors that the FBI may be very close to finishing their report\nAnd when that happens maybe it'll happen for tonight when that gets an ounce will senators will get to read it and then the cloture vote will be called and we'll have an up or down vote and we'll see where people come down on this shouldn't be that difficult to read the FBI doesn't reach conclusions they don't make recommendations they just say interviewed person\nA B C D E F G and but in every case there's no corroboration in every single case\nThey will cases inconsistencies\nAnd every single case is very problematic and all I'm saying is is if this is excess full we will never ever get good people ever in this ... like do want to do anything publicly why should de\nSean I completely agree it's a political his job and we need to stand up and make sure Republicans\nDo the right thing and confirmed

program a huge corporation commissioner Justin Olson Justin how're you doing today\nI'm doing very Well Jeff thanks so much for having me on the program\nIt's good to have you here in uh yeah I've got like a forklift here for the two dozen Eighteen general election publicity pamphlet this isn't even the candidates won this is actually the propositions and uh the sinks thick it's it's got a lot in there and is\nThat a lot of proposition ... out there a lot of it is very complex as well\nYeah and one twenty seven takes up the bulk of this book and that's the clean energy initiative which is to fire back to ... the guy on the San Francisco who's funded this thing um I I guess everybody's had your your counterpart who's running or on the program recently in the first thing I asked was\nYour position on proposition one twenty seven to clean energy initiative\nYeah you know it's a great question is an important initiative of I I'm very concerned about it I I oppose this initiative because it would\nDramatically increase utility raised hardworking Arizona families and that's\nThat's a burden that I don't think we should be placed in on\nOn Arizona families on schools on small businesses we've got to be working in the reverse direction we've got to be working to reduce rates cut that burden lower and ensure that we have safe and reliable and clean energy but do it in a common sense way that doesn't break the back of hardworking Arizona and\nYeah and this one a commissioner Olson this excluded\nWhich really baffles me and I don't know if you can maybe give me some insight why does this initiative exclude nuclear you would think\nAnd if we do that then we can keep our rates as low as possible while still ensuring that an folks go to turn the lights on the but the power is available to meet the demands of our economy and of our households\nAnd we can do that in a way that is is is appropriately taken into consideration the\nThe extra nowadays and all of the impacts on on the environment\nAnd so it is appropriate for the commission can be evaluating our the utilities investing in the most appropriate technologies and I think that that's what commissioner Tobin is trying to ask he's trying to look forward and evaluate all of the evidence about what is the most appropriate\nTechnology moving into the future it's another important questions for us to ask him about the difficult answers to find him for that's what we've got to strike is that right balance to ensure that were acting in the best interest of the repairs\nWell and what do you lock into now if you do this one twenty seven were to pass which I think would not be good for Arizona but if it did you'd be locking into hey here's what we've got to do whereas and I think a Lindy Smith was on a week or two ago she's with us or sorry you know on one twenty seven she describes it as\nYou know would we want to lock into something we're doing in the early Nineteen hundreds for example we don't know what technologies are coming and what kind of what what's going to be viable energy research is called gonna be cheaper is natural gas is going to be cheaper down the road I I don't know and I I don't think anyone knows that recognition Olson\nYeah I think you're absolutely right and that is exactly the challenge\nNow we have an establishing the appropriate policy is trying to forecast into the future and determine what's going to be the best technology for our utilities to invest in and that's why I think the appropriate approach or the commission is to charge or utilities are investing and what is the most\nEconomically viable technology that's going to be in the best interests of the rate payers if we do that then we're not going to be paying a premium for technology that a few years down the road may become obsolete we've got to let the technology Dr\nWhere the investments are going to go when the technology arrives that make\nStorage plus solar more costs\nBy all means we should have that\nAs much as we can into that technology if it doesn't arrive and something else is developed that nobody can foresee it this time that's much better than than solar plus a battery storage or that we ought to have that ability to invest in technology when it becomes available\nCommission Olson we're almost out of time but I I like to ask this of guests suspects especially election time\nUm you were you were a big champion of re looking at the rates because of the Trump tax cuts I had young several months back on that issue but going forward or you get back in there what's your big thing once you're a big issue ... you know why do you want to get back in there what do you want to do\nIt on my most important priority is to serve with the highest standard of ethics and integrity and to continue to to rebuild that public confidence in the commissioner and most importantly there'd be a strong advocate\nFor the rate payers as you mentioned I led the effort to reduce our rights I'm very proud to be able to say that rates are actually lower today than they were the day that I took office at the commissioner and that's what I Want to continue to pursue at the commission being a strong advocate for the rape para keeping our rates as\nLow as possible while being safe and reliable public services\nAlright corporation commission or just an awesome awesome couple more weeks hang in there and actually died right\nYeah they were all excited for election day to be here [laughter]\nEspecially after the primary and all of us are ready for it to be over with

on fourth street next to sonic\nLady seven boy was the big\nTalker local issues local talk the Jeff for that show\nGets the all new ... for that show this afternoon it for a Ninety seven point one the big talker\nAll right so a yes on for Eighteen you want to redo that um [noise] let's move on to say I always save for twenty two for last but\nUm you have proposition for Nineteen so it's a continuation of sales tax and I guess sometimes right now there's a lot of issues on the ballot and a lot of them are either sell sex issues or or bonding issues whether it be in a school district or or this or that there's a lot of questions is going to be a long ballot this year\nAnd a lot of people are a little frustrated that hey I had a tax for Twenty years and then as soon as this ready to sunset you come to me and say hey let's do it again I'm but is this one\nGood to redo it again and to put out there is for Nineteen and it has to do is ride ... bicycles safety improvements um what do you think you know I'm\nI'm In favor for nine ten because I ride a bike a hike\nAnd this again is for a ... well we're going to get Levin point two miles the sidewalks thirty three point eight miles of bike lanes fourteen point seven miles of thoughts\nAre at grading crossings we're going to get twelve new ones bridges in term of southern total I think it's good continuation it's going to help will probably some of the traffic issue so I Do support it and I as I understand that Seventy percent of people with those in the community are in favor of it and yeah I think that's part of our lifestyle proposition\nFor twenty um now I had a listener I reached out to the city of ... going to get them into give me just the nuts and bolts on all of these propositions but in short for twenty is the an overpass in downtown Flagstaff\nI'm over it it's a lone tree connect right basically ... is that how am I describe me right even if I understand it correctly\nSo yeah it's a ... I tell you what I'm really concerned because you have a school right down there I mean okay is it is now it's pretty dangerous you had\nThere's nothing more difficult to design a school the entry and exit honestly I mean you can\nForget the technology it's an entry you have to drop off and pick up my ticket that scary it's really scary and we've got kids in that neighborhood who walked with your parents or their parents walking with school and some don't so I find that a real big safety issue for me that's the first thing I looked at so no I Would ... no you're no yeah\nAnd I I actually had to listen to send me a great email that I forgot that my office but they were leaning yes leaning no and I think people are uncertain because they look at the ... the success of the fourth Street Bridge\nI'm which took a long time as you know um but is that the appropriate place I think people are ... the price tag is is hefty\nItself to but again it's a safety issue for me safety jumps first okay another one here for Twenty one a sales tax trends in services do we need\nWe have a pretty expanse extensive a bus service in the city of Flagstaff there they're all over the place it's first of all city it's pretty intense do we need more frequent stops should people actually be paying more sales tax for for more frequent stops or we there are we good\n[noise] well it's an improvement service so if you're going to be Fifteen to twenty minutes yeah maybe more people will write it will have to wait is kind of like the parking meter ... don't go there [laughter]\nYou know I Would like to see our daughters are back in grad school and she's able to take the bus to the university and I know with income whether snow rain\nBut it makes it more convenient\nBut my concern is you know if you look at those two propositions the continuation is how much are we really spin so unless I've missed figure that are working to be spending more or less we aren't on repairing roads as they looked at that yeah I mean my ... look at the rose from the ...\nAnd that was I was on the council's you know and that was my big push was the hundred million plus wrote package but it's still not enough where so behind on infrastructure in this nation we've we've neglected it for so long and now we're playing catch up they forget about the water lines sewer lines all that to\nA fool and you know we do catch it was going to be more expensive to get the problem with us with our society and our cultures were always crises oriented you know what it was a doctor to were sick\nYou know we don't fix up into its broken the VA system more of a sudden because we had an election we had a problem and now we're going to fix it but now that are there lessons are over and we're going back and now you know we've got a problem again so yeah yeah the bridge collapses\nThen it's very sad and you know it is sad state of these things yeah\nThere are no question about that we need the connection is this the most appropriate place I owned Gruber okay a doctor Alex a March Madness is my guest is running for the Flagstaff city council early ballots are going out here and what lessons and days or so people are going to start voting um\nOkay this one is my favorite one of 'em let me start off with this first of all we we acknowledged there is an affordable housing problem in\nFlagstaff like many communities especially with the economy expanding people getting their tax bills right now I'm actually getting tax increases too and it's it's it's expensive\nBut one of the proposals that's come out recently a mayor Karl Evans came up with an idea chicken damn hasn't hit the city council yet they got to decide whether they're gonna move forward with this or not but to condemn private property for the use of affordable housing and has to do at the end and possibly a very high\nUm the uh airhead trailer park\nVery controversial there she wanted to condemn she she's talking about condemning that property is that a road\nYou should go down there and put it this way my grandmother lived in urban renewal material on her house was condemned she got\nShe can get a fair price on it so uh so yeah I've never been really in favor of condoning private property I think this is a slippery slope to become very political and I wonder what the motivation is in this instance\nUm yeah those folks that are only had it really got hurt yeah but again you know when you think we all knew that you were renting and that's private property and is that very insensitive\nNo it's not just the way it is you know I mean I don't want my house being cut them condemned for my daughter's house main condemn because it's going to be a\nA convenience for somebody else yeah and who picks who goes I mean as far as low as diverse as it is a slippery slope because\nLater on down there may have a whole new leadership and that could get you never know how would they do\nYeah then why do you do and kind of it's interesting Dr machines because obviously domains and the constitution right up when I think that was envisioned it was like I always think the damn\n... we got to build the damage is going to flood that area oil's a high health and safety a highway that there's just nowhere else to build this bridge right um and it's a it should be sparingly years\nAnd it's concerning when people start pulling it out of their pockets say hey I'm going to use it because I liked the spot and the property values there I I've been talking a lot about any here lately and any you had there airs on a board of regents meeting today in our air is on a board of regents had their meeting today in Flagstaff for the universities\nI I've sent invites to the president of of ah any president Chang I really want them to come on because there's been these land deals are that the ... one potential potential deal with the pawn shop for ... seven point nine million\nIt's getting expensive and you see the costs\nAnd here you've got someone at once maybe condemned property in one of the what's become really a prime piece of real estate so as the ... and I didn't read stuff look at what the motivation is sure\nOK I'm the big one a proposition for twenty two\nAh which is um it's called the well as a secondary property tax general obligation by its borrow money for housing for ... afford ability twenty five million dollars my listeners and many people in the community now known as the Robin Hood tax and that was named on this show and that's that stuck\nUm this this would borrow money and put it towards a committee to decide how to do affordable housing and I'll read it to her in a second but your thoughts initially on for twenty two\n[noise] did you read my letter to the editor I\nHave to say I didn't that's right now the basically summing up here yeah first of all got bonded capacities for this ...\nYou know way of fifty million dollar bond the capacities ... love to take up ... percent came I might have bought our first responders how we're ever going to do their pension you know we're going to go into crises were already in a crisis\nBut affordable housing is it's a huge huge issue I Can't find one person really going to disagree with it\nBut when I looked at as a school superintendent I'd buy less bond was it Ninety two percent let me tell you why because we had a plan a very\nDiscreet plan we had objective red benchmarks we're way reporting back to people but we're doing which showed him or plan in great detail I don't see great detail in this this is trust me even but your checkbook that's what it sounds like to me\nFor it's for the purpose is very vague for the purpose of increasing the number of housing units affordable for more residents in the city by construction rehabilitation redevelopment and acquisition of land for housing units and ...\nAnd it would they would create a committee\nThat I Would assume the council would appoint members to that committee that's my ... anyway it's going to be a committee and a comedian and reports the recommendation city council to me is a very political process and guests have been on the show and said hey\nYou're going to pick kind of the winners and losers who gets this and who doesn't and that that's that's concerning and just a few stories from it because\nDoesn't mean you live in the same

going to talk with him for probably a good hour or during the four o'clock hour on Thursday and and he did this recently with us I Love when he does that so be ready to a call him questions comments but we're going to cover a lot\nIncluding we got it covered this national debt issue which we've covered with him in the past but\nIt's growing tremendously we've got to put a stop to this I'm also cover with him the issue of uh this horrible horrible sibling rivalry\nThat's developed where some of his siblings have come out and endorsed his opponent ... they don't live in the state by the way [noise] um but yeah we'll we'll talk with him about national debt and and when I get\nA congressional district one candidate a Wendy Rogers back on the show she was on I Believe last week\nOr what was her what her plan is if she happens to get a into office if she wins congressional district one\nAnd uh what she'll do about the debt because her her colleagues that have run that district on the opposite side on the Democratic side and remember Congressman Paul ghosts are\nHe was congressional district one and then the district changed got redistricted and then and Kirkpatrick came back in and she's running down in southern Arizona right now she'll probably get back to Congress in that district and now a first term a former Republican former independent now Democrat Tom O'Halleran he is the Democrat\nOr for congressional district one well there's a new poll out according to Breitbart dot com that has Wendy Rogers are up above Tom O'Halleran and that race\nNow in all honesty the poll was conducted by Rodgers campaign or or not conducted by them but they they they issued ... and ... and as a margin of error plus or minus four points but it's the same thing that Wendy Rogers did during the primary and she did a poll internally like this and released it\nAnd it showed her up above her challenger at the time state senator Steve Smith\nAnd lo and behold oppose right she did win by about that margin so take it for what it is it is a pool but this is one of the closest congressional races in the nation\nUh there's only a few others a handful that both Republicans and Democrats are fighting for thinking they can flip it or maybe they can hold is going to be very very close and we'll get Wendy Rogers back on the program soon but I got to ask you this especially\nAnd I want

work or maybe that live up there uh in in an abolitionist hoping nation\nHas it gotten better or worse or just stagnated under the leadership\nBut ... ... email me I'd love to hear you insight talk with Jeff had iCloud dot com\nAnd I do have an open invite to a current congressman ... oh Halloran he's been on the show once\nI'm not saying you know Democrats are welcome on this program as well Katie hatch came on she's running for secretary of state ... and You're welcome to come on and tell me some of what you've done the past two years I really want to hear from you came on right when you were took office in January I haven't heard from you since but have you done [noise]\n\nWell the appointment of a Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court is continuing to dominate the the national politics is the only thing we can talk about nationally until we get this resolved and I I don't know where this was going\nBut I Do see this article from the Atlantic and it's regarding our senator from Arizona\nSenator Jeff flake and he was quoted as saying we can't have that on court and he was referring to\nUs so let me set this up he was speaking with Jeffrey Rosen a the president of the national constitution Centre and democratic Senator Chris Coons at the Atlantic festival on Tuesday Morning flake called the judges interactions with laws lawmakers\nSharp and partisan\nThat's the center of flights that end quote this what he said he said we can't have\nOn the court and he didn't elaborate on which interactions he was referring to now flake does have an agreement with Coons from Delaware\nA that led to the FBI reopening its investigation into Kavanaugh last week as you know a ... in the sexual assault allegations and this reporter in this article in the Atlantic he says he he says he caught up with flake briefly as he left the event and asked him if he meant he would not vote to confirm Kavanaugh\nEven if the FBI cleared him by we said\nHe appeared rattled and his handlers rushed him into the stairwell unquote he said I didn't say that he's Sanford I wasn't referring to him\nJust like continues to baffled me\nHe continues the baffled me and we don't know how this Cavanaugh a appointment and how the vote will go there's been talk\nThat they may set up by the procedural votes and get going by friday but but who knows we thought it may happen last year that we don't know what's gonna happen with this\nUntil now this investigation is over and who knows what else it will lead to but anyway what does Senator Jeff flake talking about the you have the interaction with Brett Kavanaugh and the lawmakers last week's hearing he's saying are quote sharpen partisan\nYou heard what was being asked during these ah this this a lot of ridiculous line of questioning Senator Flake where you sleeping at the hearing I mean what is Brett Kavanaugh supposed to say\nWhen these things are flying out of him when questions like this are being asked\nOne of the reasons was cutting all that we are\nLooking at the book\nIs that it is relatively consistent in time with the events at issue here and because it appears to be your words is it in fact your words on your your book page\nWe we submitted things to the editors and I believe they took them I don't know if it changes things or not but you're not aware of any changes or not or you know one way or another where one way or the other but I'm not going to sit here and contests that have added if you want to go through my yearbook\nSo Senator Flake what do you propose that Brett Kavanaugh does when he's being questioned about his yearbook from when he was in high school like almost forty years ago and that's exactly what happened at the hearing that was senator\nSheldon Whitehouse Democrat out of Rhode Island who's asking these ridiculous questions about Kavanaugh's your book this is a sign that politics has reached the apex of stupidity at the highest level\nSenator Whitehouse with Senator Flake nearby continually ask very very important questions\nLet's look at a beach week Ralph club biggest contributor what does the word Ralph mean and that\nThat probably refers to are throwing up on known to have a weak stomach and I always have in fact the last time I see are you asking about having catch up on spaghetti I always say that a week so I'm like I don't know but I asked about catchy punch spaghetti you didn't someone did\nYou you've got to be kidding me now now there's a line of questioning you'd never think would be asked to buy you a senator or to a U.S Supreme Court pick now a little more clarification on what the quote unquote Ralph club is\nYou know I got a weak stomach whether it's with beer or with spicy food or anything\nSo the vomiting that you reference in the ... club reference I'm related to the consumption of alcohol\nSir I was a the top of my class academically busted my button school kept on the varsity basketball team got into Yale College when I got into Yale College got into Yale Law school for my tail off\nAnd did the word\nRalph you use how are you already are already answered I'll watch if you're a taco I like you said that I like beer I don't know if you don't like beer center or not um what do you watch the next one is or what do you what I was\nSo Senator Jeff flake is apparently you know a little concerned with the partisanship of Brett Kavanaugh I mean he's not concerned with the the light this ridiculous line of questioning from\nA Senator Whitehouse you know over the Ralph club did you ever think we'd reach a low point in American politics like this but the stupidity roll done\nUm I Am a believer in the constitution you know unbelievable and and making sure we're not spending taxpayer dollars wisely\nAnd making sure that we protect our country our southern border wall and um by doing that but just by having a stance um we've been uh I don't know if it said on the air but [laughter]\nWe've been called a a what the Uncle Tom ... look I'm a slave to the man if you would uh my wife has been attacked\nA what a what ... uh my daughter at one time my daughter was campaigning with me and we were actually a in a parade and my daughter\nUm hands a gentleman um one of our brochures and I'm the guy this is a grown man to attain you wrote a the drops the embalmed says your your dad's a traitor to the race he's a disgrace to the black race and\nAnd those are the ... and you know if you want to see that to me I got it because I got it as well my daughter's ten years as horrible horrible you know and I'm In and my wife she gets attacked I'm On Facebook and you know so it's it's it's been a lot of things behind the scenes um that\nHave come from the left and yet if\nIf a year ago you knew everything that you know now would you still live run for this office\nAbsolutely I Would have still run the only thing I Would have done different was not let my daughter handed a brochure out at a parade\nWhich is a shame because I can tell you from you know running for public office in the passenger he can ... I think a test and says well\nYou want your family involved as you as the young kids because they see in the process yeah they learn something yeah but here we are it's kidding\nI mean you can look at last weekend on very upper levels you have Senator Ted Cruz going to a restaurant and these these these lunatics come out in ... chance him out of the restaurant with his wife yeah where's decency\nAnd well it doesn't stop I mean they're going they're going to can push the lines as far as I can push and they're going to push people on the corner they're pushing the party back on the corner and one of the the big voices that came out to to stop that was the election of President Trump people were tired of it\nAnd to include of folks that are minorities are tired of the rhetoric coming from the left that is untrue the fake news they're tired of being stereotyped and pigeon told if you were based on a on a political ideology so\nYeah there's there's a silent group out there and I think it's pretty big I think people are so frustrated and we can look at and I want to drag into the whole cabinet you run for state office yes you see\nUm I think the frustration and especially the silent folks in America\nAre which is who puts President Trump into office those who are generally or not\nOr that involves they're looking at some things in saying really yearbook from forty years ago and it really is this is this what we've become where you're spending and I don't have the clips today but you have um a senator a White House and believe out of Rhode Island who's asking questions\nAbout you know\nThings when you're Seventeen when you're sixteen\nTo see ... in this country and for what you're going through I mean I Can't believe and some things that we won't share on there but I'll tell you folks I've seen them and the message as you've gotten in your family is is unbelievable and you're saying is mostly coming from folks who of think you should be\nShould be a Democrat I should be a Democrat or some kind of a traitor to a party or\nYou know I've been called trader to the race dispersed interest and if and this is my this is my point with all this ... ... is not gonna stop with me\nI'm just a guy in an attack on right now so the question that we need to ask us Americans citizens\nAre we willing to let this go and you Jerry or the next target\nOr you know Jeff or the next target windows would stop because the less will continually push go on\nThe run and do that we can go further we can go further show a we have to be aware of the Senate hit his term than it is happening in it ah it has some case it's very painful\nAnd it's real scary when you look at history and when people start disassociate him or not this is just not understanding or not even looking at the other side of a political equation maybe or a race or anything throughout history and they basically say that person's not even human anymore because they're\nWhatever conservative or you can do this or that\nThat gets scary if you study history now how many good candidates for public service harder out there that are looking at Wal black men and going like I said not going through what he went through my on I'm not even going to run for office and says I don't want to do that we lose we lose but there's good with those people [noise]\nAre you folks have seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety someone I here's one from Joe [noise] ah regarding the use of the politicians use of the back of their computer as a as a billboard as a political science during a flight so city council meetings\nAbout the [noise] public affairs show the days of polish eyes on their accounts or should we pay them or [noise] um we should have a little older generation do not appreciate\nOr love the show is kind of care when we don't want illegal alien somebody rich and get rid of any\nKind of want to fly didn't Bush other golfing\nAll right Joe thanks for that comment I've got a question or comment eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one and the issue if you missed this it has to do with Flagstaff city councilwoman ... and she's been repeated repeatedly showing up to the council meeting so this is at city hall\nAt the diet so you're in your elected position you're paid position now keep in mind the most councils in the state of Arizona are supposed to be non partisan\nAlthough politics is always play but as far as getting elected because you're an R. or in a D or an independent or whatever it's supposed to be nonpartisan did big exception is Tucson Tucson as partisan races but anyway she she's elected to represent people she's up there\nI don't know if the computer she's using your city computer or um personal computer but it doesn't really matter because she's sitting\nAt the diets that was built by the taxpayers to do the city's business now\nShe's in welcome to come on the show show probably argue that she's doing the city's business for the folks that um she represents which her pushes to abolish ice ... she had signed up to ... and you can see 'em up at talk talk with Jeff dot com it's very frustrating\nNow the the point here though is uh Joe I don't she shouldn't have that up there\nAnd I don't think the person sitting across from her should have one that says hey I Love ice I mean look why not keep that out of city hall why not just\nKeep that out of city hall do the city's business are we going to have a sign war up there you know we're all of a sudden everybody's out doing themselves and then next thing you know there's this huge banners a and this is really a matter I League ... legal legally I I don't know the legalities of it I've asked\nAnd put this out there that the city attorney should be looking into this and maybe snapping them back into line is this legal and maybe next time we get attorney general mark Vernor Vinge on the program he was on what last week or so maybe that's the question we will ask him a but it's up to her colleagues her colleagues should\nPut this in order and get this house in order and say hey enough of this nonsense you know you're here to represent the people let's do the job and they should create a rule that disallowed as I haven't heard anything about that yet are happening but that's what they should do art I got a couple

triggering anxiety with students told to do a jazz hands and said that's where you wave your hands\nWave your hands up in the air it's the most ridiculous looking thing that we should band jazz hands
