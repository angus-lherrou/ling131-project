hit politically Trump every chance they get and once they wear out that person you don't hear from 'em anymore right now it is ... a\nGood show ... who's the Saudi Arabian citizen who was in Turkey in order to get like a permission to marry some uh some Turkish woman he goes to the Saudi Arabian imaging 'cause Yogi has not been seen since October the second now this happen in Turkey yesterday on both turkey it appears probable\nA Saudi Arabian citizen was killed\nIn Istanbul, Turkey somehow Trump was responsible for that they want the president to respond to see the media use Julie sweating it for awhile dispose of her when the allegations of gang rape\nAnd Michael ... whose father Michael ... is doing a great job speaking for the Democratic party it'd be wonderful that guy would stay in the media for the next couple of years it'd be great if he was the nominee the Democratic party the porn lawyer fits the modern Democratic Party that guy's not a great job you take Julie sweat and they\nAre Deborah Ramirez or Christine forward haven't heard from them in a while I have you because the media is done using them to attack Trump or Stormy Daniels was the last time you heard from her\nOr Karen McDougal in love with the president for ten years ago\nAccess Hollywood tape but Billy Bush the comments on John McCain the Khan family Kanye West Jim ... whatever it is right now it's all about your market showed me some al media wants you to think the president's not responding correctly to the murder maybe Saudi Arabian and his damn bowl\nAs if the six or seven hundred\nBlacks killed in Chicago every year can't be used at all by the mainstream media against Trump's like north or the four thousand shot\nCan't be used in Chicago to attack the president said that north whatever the media can find some ... some club to hit the president what they're going to do it\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it after I said the deal with making our refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make and I said we're going to ... cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we just had to deal with South Korea which is much much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said that's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea are so\nMany jobs and talking to my Everytime I Can't I'm actually talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs potentially don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent the Arabs they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall\nBecause if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada and we have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair and are farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states so the European Union they formed and they uh they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they sell Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in during the Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair or we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away\nAnd then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we are as I recall me back but are going to give you one more chance engineer said that's okay I'm going to actually cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nAnd they immediately helped in a plane and came over and talk to now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with them I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the\nWe've got to find a way of five hundred million a year five trillion over ten we've built Shanghai we felt Beijing at some point we've got to start building America they got the new airport we don't have the new airport they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point in our money's gonna come back to America\nYou're so right so China's been taking are five hundred billion dollars you people have no idea what that is five hundred billion we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President she said we can't do it very simple we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've now put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been no effect you know what people don't say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because there is a twenty five percent\nSo we're taking in billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become extensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make the products here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we used to do it\nSo China has been like China is the biggest of them all by far probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost\nOver the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade we lose with everybody those days are over\nBill how Leslie wherever the midterms coming up one of my favorite movies is Jimmy Stewart it's a wonderful life I look at Bedford Falls\nBelow sea take the house Schumer Texas Senate your life becomes miserable at the last two years what

since justice now justice cabin on Fifteen jobs that are that fifty new judge many many judges\nAnd we're going to have a hundred and forty five judges fairly soon when you think about it I mean a hundred and forty five it will be close to fifty percent of the whole judiciary not only to Supreme Court justices so\nBut that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with justice Kevin are because\nI've rarely seen a person treatments\nIt's just so but that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with justice Kevin are because I've rarely seen a person treated so badly the men are great distinction a great life and the way they treated him was horrible and since that happened Republicans are looking so is everybody they see what's going\nOn that the law of unintended consequences because I've had many women were spurred my air you know bell I with Kevin they don't want to say publicly but if you send it in a weird sense Kevin all as motivated the Republican base or otherwise it wouldn't have happened\nAnd you've been a great friend of mine and I appreciate it you've been a very terrific guy and so you also a terrific talent you know a lot of

forget about no it's it's the one gift that you can visit or use every single day and tomorrow and the day after that\nAnd for that singular perfect present that's all wrapped up in a boat for this planet\nAnd every one on it it's the great pyramids of Egypt you\nDon't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving ... the great pyramid\nIs forty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly level rock pointing exactly true north south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years\nAllegedly and yet we know nothing about it\nShort decades after Cleopatra's reign of sparrow any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egypt should history\nScott and and it seemed that everything just died with her nobody knew how to read high high ... nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they would travel to Cairo and they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that you know and the answer\nAir quotes we don't know you know but it's really\nHistory Channel Discovery Channel and you know off and on about Egypt and it was interesting but it wasn't really such a you know it wasn't really a ... and focus\nAnd then a ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the wind mystery by Robert Duvall and that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the pyramids were aligned with the stars and it's just that that just kind of opens up the up\nAnd and so I started reading a little bit more and uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I had to you know I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and life and I met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise\nAnd uh and I met Robert ... a few months later and um you know it's just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um a few a couple of years in\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a y papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those ads linked to night on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the papers section everything listed in the rope\nA new is the first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight\nUh you and a Robert football and Robert shock sat down and started discussing uh the the strings and polished that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\nYeah well you know this is a this goes back to override mystery so I you know while I was reading things I haven't met the two gentlemen and yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah builds the three pyramids a and a line and and want it to align them with the three bells starts off Iran they had to be some kind of records and you know it was it your clauses believed that uh the architect of the great care of it the first of all of the three it was you know\nAnd so I looked at the stature I started looking at the statue of email and they were looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while I so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of\nA line that's on that are on the pedestal if that statue um I noticed that and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the uh the book the that they just have co authored origins of the things which is amazing both by the way it is\nYeah um and so I was reading the book and you know and Robert section is developing a you know something that he knows all against the law which is you know in front of the policy of this ... between the positive things and\nThere was a a so he was talking basically about the things that this guy and he developed that part of the book and\nAnd then I asked myself well what about the things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the servants were built if there was a ... then it's it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been a mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember at the statue I remembered the line is on the pedestal one thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page\nRobert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or at the um\nI think it was caused the origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast and I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than ... minutes and we uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it\nIs a this could be very important and that's how that paper came about why\nIs it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight yeah why is it that the well the gays applied to in general but you had the great pyramid the grades things are two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nHe's not documented the anywhere\nIn Egypt shouldn't history where you would think you know the ... love to write everything and he loved to go to tell their story and not only that but taxes and in accounting and seasons everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except\nFor the great strengths and the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nYeah that that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know to me um I mean you know the one answer you could give us that maybe we just we haven't found the records or the records were destroyed um but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or maybe total absence\nUm and of course that was the problem with it stinks you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nIn the scriptures that refers to the ... for example than a than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something that leads to things um\n[noise] the pyramids we um you know when you are next so that when you buy the great pyramid there is a tool and from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years after a you know ...\nWas alive and if you walk into that too is actually a reference to the great pyramid and also to the uh in in in the two of its called the whole rise of coup fool next to it it's the um the you know the the conference grade so\nIn in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid so they call that cover is great and who was pure of it was called the rise of Google\nAnd so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot so and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is declaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou earn your I mean yeah you would expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have but but there isn't even a general reference to two points in the direction\nAnd forget about the other something about how was builder who built it or the year was built you know we still don't even understand the purpose and\nThat it's very confusing for all\nThe way to monitor is um you know fifth century but see now this was in during personal rule um two thousand years after the fact and and what it is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know you're saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plateau and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up to ... but\nYou would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just is confusing is ... you know we also have the same issues and if it wasn't for the dream style a while and the inventory Stella we may not know anything at all\nBut\nYes that was the dream still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn of a um twentieth century that may be tougher laws to force who is the author of to dream still up between the parts of the things that\nHe has to want to build it that was actually being debated um but uh and there is a there is a small\nReference to pray but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it definitely does not say that he built it\nOn and so that's the dream still at the end mentors the ... the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when ... ... what actually ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same as the ... the Greek name Cooper's the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that the human towards the United states very under critically when ... came to the ... things already exist that in fact it was broken he repair that and then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid of his queen Knutson\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now the coast to coast am are murals to be church or get my news said is ... and it's all the

talking about the inventory ... and the dreams della right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward and in the dreams della uh most of the forum\nSays mentions and in illustrates two things is there and desert boxing just tweeted is there a second ... thinks well there's two things\nThere I Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second being being in the sky I think it actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a ... he is there a second Spanx\nIf a great question I'm Out of it so that was for that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the seconds things uh as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo but\nUh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question and it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double edits things are and that double headed sings is in the underworld and of course is a is\nA ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nAnd these depictions are um you know they're on unmistakable so so the answer to this question specifically of course it hasn't been found there\nAre stories uh Arab historians referred to\nAn actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build mosques so they're they're apparently was physical things\nAre on the other side of denial but it's there it's things buried under the sense that say west of ah coffers pyramid it's possible\nThe\n... and ... you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repaired this beings but build the great pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just to repair guy but he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why the discrepancy\nYeah uh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as yet of course Egypt colleges most is your pauses do not accept the inventories the la\nAs a historical document and ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we counter this argument so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so what's your question\nUm they're the uh you have to go to a texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egypt she means to read it means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the with the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the ... the combination is pet him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a a is a is a strip of text where you know the pyramid building has mentioned and yeah the verb that this is not further\nA qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuild\nUm is that a hundred per cent proof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the fires of ... that was found in ... and the red sea\nYou know they are saying well you okay this is my ... talks about to a store and being ... a ... a a but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and uh who you mean it was amazing interview you have written the other day he made a good point you said that ah he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was back field\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour I to be that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up the courses and then you back so later so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their own mind about\nIt and there was a quite a bit of relatives are you a pyramid like who who is dealing with uh also one of the ... applies so why would there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramids\nThere are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes\nYes yes there is a there is a reference to a head Knutson um hit Knutson a this was also you know a ... a contentious subject so who is going to the news and so she was supposedly is clean\nAnd uh he built a pair of it for her at the southern most of the three ah off that three a queen permits that are on an empty field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but\nIn the human tourists there like it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting to sell out because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a princess ... again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that she I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we we think is the poop shows that she was a print says\nSo that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then don't you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or\nA an old Cyrus other Stella and that those are much further reasons why Egypt colleges reject this though because they are saying\nYou know if this were in ... story or at the time of coup who these ... ah you know ISIS on his eyes were not yet a work being worship there were not official states sanctions or in the eighties and we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nUm but you know it's it's a contentious I I don't want to make it sound like we have the outs or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nThere's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids are crumbling they don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same answer with the same care\nThose would be more simple to build and you would you would expect those to be just as elegant if even you know more complex yeah they're not and they're the stone work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the premise have been a you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing are is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just call me that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship\nAnd I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place and I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality of you know they're smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to\nUh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I but I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old King I'm I'm a you know middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the workman ship definitely declined um after the old kingdom\nNow let's get to or what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yeah after we had been told over and over again\nAnd it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there\nWell clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is one of the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing\nUm and the and what I like about it is that it was non invasive you didn't have to drill holes you didn't have to you know like a\nFor more information on adoptions is it a donkey was getting so toward a message from the U.S department of health

V. isn't there\nNo if I'm In sometimes you can add on your yeah but sometimes you can I think that\nI mean we're it's like we're kind of making fun of it a little bit here but it is a problem for a lot of death people who are trying to get news they were trying to keep up with politics who are trying to enjoy different thing and they can't because there are a lot of places that they have no access to it the same as any other handicap I mean we wouldn't be joking if they if you know\nI'm not real joking I'm just uh I'm bothered by the fact that there must be were were were deaf people who've gotten information prior to this by reading newspapers were were they get their information\nWhy am I why hasn't there been a super for this I have a deaf people because now they're not hanging in front of deaf people I'm just saying I'm actually hiring lawyers\nI gave him coming out now because now they're easy technology that if a place like NPR that has access to a lot of money and a lot of technology and there's access now that they could get here's what I Want to know that that didn't exist before\nI wouldn't want to know whether these people instead of filing suit first shoot first ask questions later did they go to NPR on NPR said screw you are not going to\nDo it I I don't know I find that our daily very specific maybe adept person complain about it to their lawyer and the lawyer you know God all okay this is a chance for it to make a lot of money you're right maybe something like that is happening but I Know when I go on YouTube and I see\nThere are a ton of people who complain on news services like the BBC and stuff like that of not being able to access any of the content because they don't put\nAny of the words on the screen and to me that's a fairly simple easy thing to do NPR Oreo transcribed transcript that pretty much everything so that's what my own lines\nThey went through images from his suit to see if they can't shake 'em down\nMaybe but I I Do think it's an important thing you know but that stemmed from a lot of complaints that yeah deaf people have made to NPR and then\nTo envy I mean I ... I could buy it if it was some talk station in Austin, Texas or something or some national show like\nMembers yeah again we want to you know but in this circumstance\nWhy because NPR is so aggressive and you're right that they don't have\nThat yeah I mean are you NPR is right but I don't I don't think that they have everything together I think that NPR is the same as a lot of other stations and that you know I kind of did a big project on them in school and they still you know all of their sports stories all the vast majority of their stories are still done\nBy men and they're like very women Little Women involved in in ... in ways that you would think that they're super progressive they're not really that progressive though\nI don't know there's a lot of people who are disabled or not able to access the content and I'm not really that surprised by it because I live on the Internet all the\nTime that's fixed that it's time for us to do some sports Victoria\nYou can do [noise] you can represent women in sports for the story of a women only car racing this actually fun but as usual with something good happens there is somebody who's going to take a shot at it so\nWell it was yeah a lot of women are not happy about this it's called the W. series of two women only car racing series\nThat will begin and twenty Nineteen competitively it's an attempt to funnel talented female drivers into high level racing formula one according to the series itself Eighteen to twenty women will be selected from a pool of applicants and they will compete in identical formula three cars and six races across Europe next year\nThere is a one and a half million dollars in prize money five hundred thousand of uh of that will be awarded to the overall series winner and then the rest gets distributed the W. series issued a statement saying at the heart of the W series DNA is the firm belief that women can compete equally with men in motor sports\nHowever an all female series is essential in order to force greater female participation now here comes the backlash a lot of female drivers say that they should have taken the one and a half million dollars in prize money\nAnd supported women's teams to compete in the already existing theories\nLike more than ... and all the other gentleman Victorian on ... seven void won the day or Tucker dominated by men by ... hundreds of\nAll that stuff and so I'm Lynn St James who is a very well known driver she's competed in Seventy five hundred between Ninety two and two thousand and she helps develop young driver she said any opportunity that gives a chance to put women in cars it's great\nBut you have to take a hard look at it she said do we need a women only series no I don't think there's a need for that and a lot of other drivers are basically saying the same thing one driver hit the man who is on a six on Indy five hundred driver she called the series and historic step backwards on Twitter\nAnd so now here's the thing unlike most sports men and women can actually compete head to head in car racing because it doesn't there's no physical advantage to being bigger and stronger if you're a man or so it's not like the WNBA versus the NBA\nWhich it was a comparison that a lot of people tried to make on social media\nThere is really no need to segregate men and women and men and women are really not happy with this so we'll see how it goes it starts in May of twenty Nineteen so I'm just ... interesting\nMain St James it first came up was ... ah Lynn St James talked to a driving your ass off [laughter]\nShe must be quite a character I'm guessing I don't know I've never heard of it before but uh yeah I think there's something because it's really ... back to the same issue I mean it really is the same issue it's men trying to to deal with the stresses\nOf the day that is the push to have women\nEqual in every aspect of live lives of our lives life today in America and there's a this is their token way of of um you know I mean I can understand that actually thinking\nDefinitely I think on the one hand it might introduced us to some women drivers that we may not have had yeah no yeah but at the same time I understand the argument from a lot of the female drivers thing will take that money\nAnd support our team we need sponsors\nDanica Patrick has new career right now because she lost all authors yeah so like I totally see both sides of this and I I don't know I think for maybe for the male drivers who are supporting this maybe it's a way to get women\nOff they're tracking that once you separate this it will be one of those separate but not equal\nAnd I think that it it was a lot of women may get pigeonholed and stuck there\nBut uh uh other activity here a skier Lindsey Vonn say she going to retire the end of the upcoming season she holds the women's record for the most World Cup wins eighty two of them just for whiz behind all time leader Swedish skier you're more stand

actually really kind of an exciting time because\nLabels are worthless Thomas Paine wrote heaven knows the proper priced too attached to something so celestial is freedom it's true every single generation I think except for the last the boomers had to earn and renew their freedom they didn't buy\nOr sell the label the greatest generation that that that generation didn't have it wasn't them who came up with that title [noise] it was actually the boomers\nTheir children at the\nTime there weren't labels like we have now for every you know every subset of every generation ... people saw themselves as people and Americans they saw crisis not as anybody's fault but rather\nOh crap their turn to stand and do the right thing\nIs what they did with their crisis that made others years later bestow upon them the title the greatest generation\n\nWell I don't know if you noticed this but ah we're living in a time of great crisis set up people and I don't think it's going to India and be much different or a smaller scale than the great struggles of the past\nAnd in that struggle all of the labels that we think we have now will fall away all of those that have been bought will become worthless\nAnd every new label for each of us will be purchased with blood sweat tears were actual courage\nAnd what we face in the end\nIs not going to be smaller than what many of our grandparents or great grandparents faced in the world wars\nIt's not going to be any less frightening than the global economic unrest of the Nineteen thirties but it's not going to be greater either it's just going to be hours\nAnd just like the generations gone by it'll be our choice whether or not we survive\nI think this is a blessing\nThe boomers never got to see who they really were\nThe boomers feast it off the crisis of their parents they never really had to choose for themselves\nLike the greatest generation did life or death freedom or slavery they never had to push themselves as a group beyond what humans thought was even possible to achieve something as valuable or as celestial as freedom\n\nThe crisis that we're now beginning to see is a blessing to blessing our parents never received each of us it's going to have to choose we're gonna have to pick between black and white slavery or freedom good or evil life and death the choices are going to be that clear\n\nWe will all know\nIn the years to come who we really are if we choose carefully who we really are\nOtherwise we will be painfully aware of who we simply allowed ourselves to become\n\nCan become through this struggle exactly who we were born to be our best and highest self\n\nIf each of us were honest and we began to see the struggle in the proper like we did Mitt that it's the softness of our foundations that have caused all these troubles\nAre wanting an easier life not making the hard choices not having to say no not having to say yes\nBut Brock Obama nor Donald Trump or the problem or the solution there symptom look around you no matter who you voted for I think all of us\nAre not the enemy no matter who they voted for\nAnd if you're not there yet or your neighbors not there yet I send them ponder this\nWho and your family came here I don't care if it was three months ago or three centuries ago why did they come here they came here to make a better life\nFrom a country that would not allow them to follow their dream for one reason or another\nFrom a country that they didn't value hard work\nTo a country that did value hard work and allowed you to keep what you belt so you could live better than you did before or you could have a better life than your parents or your grandparents you could afford a better life for your children so they could achieve even more than you did\n\nThat at that opportunity is not coming because we have just to bless land\nBecause we have all kinds of climate and you know Great Plains and mountains and and shoreline it's not that\n\nDoesn't even come from the people because quite frankly sometimes people suck it came from our mission statement it\nCame from the American thesis that all men are created equal endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among them life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and while that mission statement was and always will be aspirational\nAs it's never been fully achieved\n\nHas done a great good even in its\nIn its worst interpretation it has done great good\n\nIt shaped and given the best chance to succeed when it's protected by the guard rails of the constitution and the bill of rights\nPeople came here because of our laws\nCome from the American ceases that's what created the modern world\n\nIt is indeed why people still die in the middle of the night\nOn the desert just trying to get to the side of the border\nCan I ask you went on his question\nIs it really that much of a stretch to believe that you and I are not alone in our doubt of our doctors\n\nIt's really that hard to believe that our neighbor who knows how sick we all are really wants everyone who disagrees with their doctor to die\n\nIs it possible that our neighbors have seen the flaws in their practitioner as we have an hours but we haven't talked about that\n\nIs it really that much of a stretch to think that if we stop spending all of our time looking at what's wrong with America or what's wrong with them we might be able to see and search for the things that are right with America and good about our neighbors\n\nPerhaps were not as sick as all the doctors tell us are perhaps our doctors our politicians that are parties are more akin to bad crooked chiropractors that you've gone to and have done more damage to your spine than good and will continue to bilk\nUs out of every single dime week after week until we finally stand up and say you know what no\nOr we're broke\nAnd I understand why we haven't wanted to listen because most likely are friends of all said don't go down that road\nOur family matters that don't don't don't go to him and then you really believe that new font and now you're sitting here and you realize geez they're right and I don't want to be wrong I don't want to tell them that they were right\nThat again perhaps we are beyond help and we only have months to live but if it is that way I don't know about you but if we're going down\nI Want to go down with my friends and my family around me and all of them all of them\nEven those who told me not to listen to my doctor or the one I angrily chased away because I just knew they were wrong I Want\nAll of them by my bedside\n\nI think we should spend some time\nEspecially when we look at what's happening in Portland in and realize it's really easy to jump on the bandwagon and light fires\n\nIt's really hard to put fires out it's easy to lose friends and family and chase them away it's a lot harder to bring them back\n\nToday there are four stories in the news that talked about our founding documents and our structure of our country our constitution so they all failed well\n... no not really no they were just forgotten\nOur founding documents really are only an idea that's it I think a really good idea\nThat says yeah we should all be able to choose who we want to be you know build our own life charter own course and be left alone if we want to be left alone or be or right on top of each other if we want to but whatever we choose we can live our life with dignity insecurity that's a pretty damn good idea\nBut that idea hasn't failed\nIt's just that nobody really remembers it believes in it anymore\nI still do\nAnd I think you do and I will bet you that your neighbor does as well\nI'm not a doctor well actually I Am I'm a doctor if humanity's as means I can treat any anything and the human body said listen to me here I'm I'm a doctor I think our illnesses all in our heads\n\nI think we've been convinced by those who suffer from some sort of societal Munch housing by proxy\nThen were fatally ill and will only survive because of them\nAnd I have to tell you that's a lie they need us to be sick I don't know about you but I've had enough time in bed\nNot as sick as they tell us\nThey've convinced that they've filled in the line for us because we never had to fight for it we never had to fight for what that blank is as a country we say I am what worthless racist over no\nWe as a country we are a powerful force of good\n\nWe are people who make mistakes\nFrom them\nWe use that people are always looking at a better tomorrow not a dusty\nBroken passed\nWe came here for a reason one of the reasons is we wanted to leave the past in the past we wanted to charge the new court\n\nIf we choose to see things the way they are and couple that with who we always have ... ... ... to be our best selves better not not better than the neighbor just better than you were yesterday\nCan you just be slightly better than you were yesterday not perfect not like him not like her stopped comparing yourself\nCan we be better than we were yesterday if we can do that and see each other in the best light put our past in the past\nAnd our strife and are coming crisis in the right\nRight like down the road down the road after we've done all of the hard work some other generation that will come along\nName and give a label to us I

drive that and you're almost guaranteed a stop at some point because of an accident is horrible\nBut we're dealing with that in every city ... not no exception train tracks\nTrain tracks are wonderful help to grow the town I'm freight\nTraffic is huge in this without freight traffic we would be we couldn't move the products of goods and services things like that right [noise] um but it causes a problem it has divided our town and half literally\nA there's a proposal to build a bridge\nThe tracks near downtown Flagstaff is that what for Twenty years\nThat's what four twenty and also about that one All right so first I Do want to remind that for Nineteen as a renewal of an existing tax\nIt's for infrastructure capital projects all over town K for twenty is new\nAnd it is a new an additional tax sales tax okay and as specifically to build the railroad overpass a lone tree road okay so we're lone tree currently stops and his ... trucks it would extend over to route sixty six okay but it is that\nUm [noise] you're close to an underpass is it needed right there\nI I don't know maybe that's a question you can't answer your ... you're not here to advocate ... why is it need well you've you've litter numbers wise it needed yeah my answer\nIs everybody is going to have to decide if they think it's needed now and you know at this time and a ... a project that's essential the rules and it's being put forward is really to create an alternative to Milton road\nUm there was a lot of construction on Nelson and by prop for Nineteen which will if it's approved it will widen and improve lone tree\nAnd if prop for twenty is approved it will connect with the improved alone tree and be an alternative to Milton road are and that's what we're looking forward to open up new transportation court orders okay I got a couple of\nQuestions for you but I promise to take some calls so I Need to do that at age seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one if you have a question for I'm Jeff regarding these transportation issues or\nIt's either Mike or Mick Mike or Mick sorry bad text\n[laughter] you're on the air\nJeff love your show listen to it a lot well thank you know this isn't the occurred for tissue culture but not necessarily road\n... of it was a long time to go to this topic because of the closest you regret [laughter] it's regarded airport oh okay I'm Wondering why or ... or ... or a competition losers are up to the city sure about that\nYeah yeah and I thought you were going to ask me about her craft or something but no no thanks for Russian um I'll get a stab at this and then if you want to try to chime in but um there was a time where and I believe that we did pick up a second then we pick up something recently at the airport\nOn the as Harry er okay here's a service to LA okay there's not certain ... for the longest time it well for it was us air right and then\nI'm somebody bought them out right they merged now too it's the one carrier\nIt's American American thank you [noise] mine's gone\nNow during I think before the last\nBubble and crashed there was horizon there\nAnd they came in right wasn't at horizon\nIt was as another airline I Believe us horizon they came and they had a subsidy for a certain amount of money as soon as that subsidy ran out or they were gone uh those subsidies just you know really challenging the challenges in Prescott just picked up we had feel good council member from Prescott city council um ... micro mic\nMay okay we had him on and I'm the challenges getting these airlines into very small markets and making it profitable I Believe just does that sound\nAbout right yeah I'm not not airport guy even have the protection guy but no I I that was coming from ... um it's when I was on the city council that was part of the challenge was how do you make those routes profitable and now there is a route to LA but I don't think you're ever going to see and I you know you're not gonna see wants to New York or something\nOut of ... because it's just it's a matter of volume in the number of people\nI suspect that the ah university students coming in and now that would be profitable some more friendly not yeah\nDon't know maybe they got a hitch I care Hey Matt ... thanks for your comments I you know what I Will do and making a note is about making no we're going to get a we'll get some airport folks in All right and we're also joined us okay I'll do that let me get through the election now [laughter]\nMake hay bishop that call eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven when I hear what Jeff ...\nAnd I pack anymore on the bus at the same time at nine o'clock at night I'm running through them all\nKnow we might have very few people are a handful her on the bus so it it varies on time of day and we average thirty ... per hour and that's competitive if you look around the country for how efficient transit systems are\nBut every voter has to decide if they think that should not spend what they want to do\nWell let me ask you this because I'm thinking of more questions here as you're talking um I did have the governor unless there's and we talked about the growth of any you\nAnd we've we've talked a lot on this program with gas and there's a lot of community a lot of community members a lot of folks that call me up from throughout northern Arizona her like and he is getting huge that twenty let's call twenty three twenty two thousand students\nThere is a target of thirty three thousand students now you said that a lot of these buses a lot of students are using the public bus system what percentage I mean do you know [noise]\nYeah well I'm I'm Glad you asked that um we have about twenty five percent of our troops over all our students okay so but there's something else with prop for Twenty one\nWith a bus going by now every hour after six o'clock and on weekends it's not particularly attractive to students\nThe ... the university has agreed to partner with ... in the city so if for Twenty one has approved the university will bring a million dollars to the table to by a bus pass for every student\nSo that now till the higher quality service and students will just be able to show their id and get where they want to go\nAnd the idea here is to take advantage of the fact that this is a university community and students tend to ride transit if it's a good option and to\nGive them that option okay yeah and that's a ... and take take them out of this is about the one million dollars um\nAh that would be a good question if we get the president of the university on the show we'd love to have president Chang come on the show I talked about that with the governor of the other day um that'd be a great one of the topics I'd like to talk to her about which is if for Twenty one passes who knows my time I get her if I get her\nThat may have already the election may have happened but you're saying uh they're committing one million dollars\nSo that they can buy every student or give every student a pass basically right okay how much is for Twenty one\nWhat's the dollar figure on that\nSo for Twenty one will generate about two point seven million a year over ... ... each year over ten years and it will sunset again in ten years okay the ... if it passes than the university would bring a million dollars a year\nTo the table so that we would provide more service together and make it easy for students to right\nYeah 'cause I can I can hear folks saying I don't think they realize that there's that that that a quarter of the folks who are riding the bus system our students and it could be more if this passes because they're the times would be different and more a better times for students at that facilitate kind of their lifestyle that's what you're saying\nWell let's see idea of the partnership okay and also the idea that if there's more students on the bus then they're not you know in the cars on the roads taken effect capacity sure [noise]\nAll right I'm for Nineteen for twenty four Twenty one folks have to\nDecide you're not here to make up their mind but yeah obviously you're you've been working in public transportation for many many years um and uh and by the way before we got you're not getting away with this you worked at fellow very long time ago I did\nBefore my Twenty one years in public transportation what'd you do I was a generator jumper which means that means I got onto a self contained breathing suit with oxygen and everything and had to jump in and work as fast as I could because it was so close to the nuclear reactor\nAnd then jumped back out again we had like a well we got time did a mock up facility and everything to get in and do the work and get\nBack out well that's because I as you know I went there and toward it friday a ... and um we were up on the catwalk we suited up but it was you know your face is still open it's not rifle on what I call that you were in the fall or fall on I'm\nI'm back to the future when they see is worried and whether the Libyans are ... you know that that thing with putting the plutonium and obviously not plutonium your deal so you would jump in\nTo do your work but you can only stay in a short amount of time and then get out and then I had to cut off a bus so you had to catch the uh [laughter] but you had to take off all the gear or you had to go through the process this was twenty something years ago ... finance might have been they had scanners just like I Would uh it's like a mold\nOf a of a person and you go you put your body in there and they detect if there's any radiation left on you oh I thought when I was only knew they probably just use the uh\nThe Geiger counter shop back a shot back [laughter] did you do the uh did you did a scrub down to they have to do that like ... down type thing no I never had that you know all these different okay lines like like where are you going with this it's a it's an interesting it was an amazing place\nAnd I'm a I H ... when we talk about things like bridges when we talk about our power when we talk about infrastructure people don't realize how much work goes into the stuff\nI mean how to how many people does need to have\nA hundred and flows yeah so I mean it's just amazing I ... I was going to let you go but Walter has a quick question then I'm going to let you go okay well it's a real quick eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one what's in your mind\n[noise] question and they keep an eye and area a ... day living you know it doesn't even come to high density or the bus or come to\nTheir first doesn't come even through the eyes they hide it in All right okay I can stop the mile and for me okay yeah how would that\nShow and I [noise] [laughter]\nOh hang on you sounds like you're talking through ah can now hang on to get that phone adjusted let's let's have a Jeff answer that question real quick about a location and I mean you can't density that what he's talking about\nThe I mean what I'm hearing as wide as the bus not come in university heights to give people yeah yeah and I was involved in the decisions and the recommendations to actually not do that and the board was involved and the thing with the transit system the reason we moved to point four million people here is because we keep the buses\nOn the highest density areas the business districts the high density apartment houses to move people where they want to go\nAnd when we moved buses into lower density areas like a quarter acre lot\nOr out to ... park where it's a five acre lot and then you have people calling up and saying well there's nobody on that bus yeah and and there isn't more expensive to run it isn't as expensive for passengers so we've worked on it's just been the policy of NATO to\nTo have one of the most productive inefficient systems we can move as many people as we can for the money\nWon't let me ask you this real quick because it they probably could bring it into every neighborhood but it if I have to pay a lot more or there'd be a higher tax is that a good tradeoff\nHigher tax and the thing is the drier white not ever\nYeah yeah\nYeah I Do I think it's a you know it's an economic decision I that's a question yeah there's not a perfect answer I hear this point yeah hey well sort of appreciate but I got to let you go\nI mean they gotta catch above yeah he's gotta catch a bus literally so our job my back former CEO of ... to appreciate your time and uh we'll see what you see folks low for for Nineteen for twenty four Twenty one I'm decided yet I'll give my recommendations here probably towards the end of the week but appreciate the time All right thank you Jeff\nAll right if you've got a quick comment or question eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one back in a minute [noise]\nJeff or of a show Monday through friday at three PM [laughter] neither\nBe a jogger [noise]\nYou've heard me talk about twilight janitorial\nYou know that's why like janitorial company I use for all my business cleaning I use twilight janitorial because I Need a great cleaning service for my business and I know you do to\nSo focused on your business not on cleaning it and let twilight janitorial handle all your company's cleaning give twilight janitorial a call today nine to eight\nEight five three eighty sixty four that's twilight janitorial\nNine to eight eight five three eighty sixty four\nI used to a job or it only to sort through tons of resume to find a few candidates for my ... my hair salon that old process was not smart then I went to the appropriate air it's technology scape resume for me to find the right people and actively invites them to apply to walk it qualified candidates that smart", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "15"}
