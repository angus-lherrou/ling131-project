continue to calls in a moment I Want to circle back to an issue you know my friend Dan bungee know often sits in this chair as well and I've known down since I first they actually before I even came to Washington and he's been so great on this issue with Spygate and with the FBI and the doors and\nAh all that jazz and I've been doing a quite a bit on that story as well\nAh I recently this we got to interview Carter Page and a quarter page is a central figure\nOf the uh Spygate scandal right ah and and the he hasn't done a whole lot of media but I was able to have a quite an extensive conversation he's in the news this week and I don't know if you saw this but Carter Page has filed a defamation lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee\nAnd against a Perkins Kuwait which is a a high powered D.C law firm that represented the DNC and by extension the Hillary Clinton campaign you know in a presidential campaign when a person gets the nomination for a party they are the de facto head of that party\n... and especially I implore you read Donna Brazil's book it's called hacked\nAnd it's a double entendre it's partly about the Russian thing but it's also about what happens her experience taking over the DNC after Debbie Wasserman Schultz who was a mess it was a complete mess and she she tells a lot of truth in this book about how awful Debbie Wasserman Schultz was and how terrible the Hillary Clinton campaign was to her personally\nAnd to the DNC\nHow the Hillary Clinton campaign absolutely ran roughshod over them a bill to them for whatever money that was coming in and they were in charge of all of it All right so so when you hear that the DNC hired a farm through a lawyer to create fusion GPS to to create the Russian dot CA\nThat apparently you know sly and Carter Page uh that really means the Hillary Clinton campaign\nBecause they call the shots so not Carter Page this week prior to death filed a defamation lawsuit against them against the DNC and against a ... now why did he go after those people really I think it's because they have deep pockets frankly that's where the money is\nAnd and and had it not been for those two entities there wouldn't have been a Russian dot CA there wouldn't have been stories saying that Carter Page is an agent of the Russian government there wouldn't have been a a a five to warrant\nThe petition for and approved or to the FBI petition for by the FBI unapproved fruit flies accords for them to survey on him to look into every little or if is of his electronic\nFootprint via email text messages phone calls and the people who associate with him for over a year they kept getting this are incredibly intrusive\nSpy warrants that that without a fight the war and it is against the law for a federal agency to spy on an American citizen the\nOnly way they can do it is real Pfizer worn and they're supposed to be a very high bar to get a five to warrant\nAnd to get the spice of weren't they had to use the the Russian dot CA the claims Carter Page was and they in fact if you look at the applications for the warrant for the ... weren't the FBI said we believe Carter Page is an agent of the Russian government it's right there and black and white\nAnd we believe that he was working on behalf of the Russian government to alter American foreign policy through his meddling in the presidential campaign of twenty sixteen on behalf of Donald Trump that's what they said that's what they claim that's what they maintained under oath to the court\nSo Carter Page filed a defamation lawsuit this week suing the DNC and ... with this law firm\nFor defamation and I think about this from it Carter Page is either an agent with the Russian government\nAnd basically participated in a subversive if not outright treasonous acts against our nation\n\nDuring the twenty sixteen presidential election or he is an innocent American citizen who has been slammed and slandered into famed and used as a tool for political purposes not just by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign but ultimately by the Justice Department and the Obama administration\nHe's got to be one of the other right\nYet there's no in between here there's no if and or\nCertainly no but I mean if there was a button hero it'd be a car Daschle and proportions\nCarter Page is either as stool or a a sorry a stew age of the pudding and crumbling\nOr he is completely innocent\nAnd and you know I don't know if you know a lot about Carter Page I guess it hasn't done a lot of a media he's a Naval Academy graduate he was a navy officer as all Naval Academy graduates are unless they're you know pro athletes [noise] he was in intelligence in the navy in an officer\nIn the intelligence division which you know usually you've\nSome hurdles that you have to cross to get into military intelligence in the United States Navy as an officer um and after serving his time well beyond his obligated time as an officer after he\nMilitary intelligence in the United States Navy as an officer um and after serving his time well beyond his obligated time as an officer after he got his a Naval Academy education he then went into private business\nAnd did went into the energy sector he got his doctorate by the way he is about the ever noticed that you can't say Christine Blasey Ford's name without saying Dr Ford but what was the last time they said Dr Carter Page he's a doctor he got his doctorate and\nHe didn't do dealings with energy sectors out of Russia you can argue with that if you want but understand most of his dealings were in the house in days when Hillary Clinton had a reset button when Bill Clinton was pulling down six figures for giving a speech in Moscow\nAnd when a rock Obama was promising his counterpart there that he'd have more flexibility after he got rid of this ah this Mitt Romney guy and won reelection\nSo it was a different time it was a different era it was okay to do business with Moscow now he's still thinks that's a good idea to do business with Moscow he actually doesn't think the government is as bad as everyone says\nThat's what that's not a legal he he can do that in fact it's not illegal for a business to do business with Moscow as right now as we speak no\nSanctions and in a in a huge way against that government their individual sanctions against individuals but uh businesses can still do but we\nWe still do business with Moscow you may disagree but guess what he has the right to do that that doesn't make them a spy it doesn't make them a Russian agent now he could be don't misunderstand my point here Carter Page could very well\nBe an Asian or the Russian government as the FBI maintained based on the Russian dot CA paid for by the DNC and this law firm that Carter Page is now suing but ask yourself something as you evaluate the story as you use your cognitive skills\nYour reasoning the brain that the good lord gave you\nAs you evaluate the story that has presented to you that the FBI and the Obama administration said Carter Page was an agent of the Russian government and has been for years and worked on behalf of the Kremlin and let him are prudent to colluded with Donald Trump to meddle in the twenties sixteen presidential election as\nThey say that understand to facts number one to this day no one has charged Carter Page with anything\nNot James Comey not Loretta Lynch not Jeff Sessions not Rod Rosenstein\nNo one at the federal level no one at the local level now one of the state level\nCarter Page has not been charged with a crime of any kind and they have sort of veiled every inch of his life\nFor almost two years they've got everything on him no charges number one so so think about that for a minute and then think about this if you're Carter Page and you are an agent of the Russian government and you did commit near treason effects\nBy colluding with the Trump campaign and a vitamin pollutants Kremlin to alter our presidential election and twenty sixteen if\nIf that were true why would you file a lawsuit why would you file a defamation\nLawsuit against the DNC\nBecause you see the perfect the fact that the DNC can defend themselves and get out of this lawsuit with one very simple strategy it's only defamation if it isn't true so\nAll they've got to do is prove that Carter Page is in fact an agent of the Russian government and if you're Carter Page why would you invite that\nWhy would you open yourself up to discovery why would you open yourself up to a full court well funded and you know there's going to be a lot of money funding their defense all well funded investigation into you\nThose sending me messages saying hey she has a right to do this before she has a right to do the splits

that to a Russian as four hundred a that's why there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the\nNineteen thirties when Ataturk tried to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his Islamic viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire [noise] ah so NATO no I I don't think that they should be a member of NATO\nYou know NATO such a complex\nThing for us today as we mentioned in the last hour or because you know anyone could you know call for an article five say you know the Russians are picking on me please come to my rescue\nOr do we want to be tethered in the future war world to that well\nYou know we have that alliance him to keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians and the Chinese\nAre just you know very tight now out of necessity\nThey don't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them but they want to form their own little alliance and to a certain degree of his belt and road strategy of president Xi around the world and collaboration with the Russians and military exercises this is all painting a picture where you can see a divided world\nEmerging I'm so to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts of you know warts and problems with it\nAt this point might not be well advised\nBut certainly allowing turkey into our secrets into our systems with a Russian made air defense system is not a good idea you\nKnow far for me to to um stand up for the house of Saud by\nA given that so much of the narrative of the show the murder has come from the Turks and also cutter or another sort of sworn enemy of Saudi Arabia is it possible\nDo you think there's anything to the the idea that that cutter turkey are trying to drive a wedge between the United states and uh there's there are their allies the Saudis with is\nOf course you know that's a sort of thing that you know kind of the poker and the Internet geo political world that takes place all the time behind the scenes\nYou know who were the people that were in the\nYou know the Saudi embassy that night uh I suppose some details will eventually come out with the clandestine type of operations now from one nation to another or perhaps not nation states but other activities\nTake place unfortunately all the time you know we're in a tight spot what can President Trump to he can sanction entities and individuals\nOr even if ... ... was you know demonstrated to have been\nMurdered as it would appear to be by a henchmen that were under the leadership of saw him on don't know but that could be clearly we could cancel the arms deal but I mean we've been not only a hundred and ten billion it's far in excess of that\nAnd we have a lot of people on the ground working hand in glove with him but we risk a relationship with a with the Saudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons\nAnd the packs of course distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so you you've got to look at second and third order effects of any decision geopolitically and that part of the world\nUh otherwise you end up with no one that you can go to and work with a given your your vested interests and of course the the Yemen situation we've been helping them a great deal the rea Riyadh government\nAnd trying to battle the who cheese and others of course the Iranians you know through proxies in that part of the world um I Wish it were simple it's not simple uh the world's divided\nAnd of course as we see is what I call the alliance of evil Russia and China you using the mechanisms behind the scenes through a variety of proxies not just the north Koreans and the Iranians but others\nI think all a era one is going to be one of those proxies to a certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um I think the Chinese have a better idea for him\nA ... if you were in John Bolton supposition or you had the president's ear who knows maybe you do or what would you be advising how how ... how do we counteract this how do we step back from the brink of of war\nWell I I Do believe that a boat and we will talk to his counterpart about uh\nYou know renewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one we've got to do that or it's neither country's best interest to not have a an agreement that isn't forcible the problem is and the Russians notice that a Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty was\nUh was violated or with their own cruise missiles\nAnd ah you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes or you know we've done a lot of in the open a so I think that will will get something I Know that\nYou know they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July but yeah they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas about the fact that he can meet with the world leader ah on the west Trump\nYou know in the eyes of the the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know putting his meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis just solidifies that viewpoint so if I were both ... and ... you know I I've I've talked to John Bolton before and so I just\nI kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he he's a real pragmatist he is a tough guy and but he does have the president's ear and I think that that's it\nThat's going to be the top of the agenda and of course uh he'll probably try to deal with\nThe issues in Syria and with air to want a and of course uh the Iranian the Iranians are our problem for Israel\nUh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know those volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs\nUm we don't acknowledge it a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the Iranians are up to no good\nIf there were any regime regime change in Iran and and hopefully that will come up\nIt's a good reason to believe the Iranians are up to no good\nOr if there were to be regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that will come about by the Iranian people\nAre just getting fed up with the situation with and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become more of a secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation [noise]\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know be you know the military and their diplomacy or you know to\nPromote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic world view of of the removal of\nWhen I I think that you find that they're not involved with the who teased and not involved with Assad a there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests and perhaps even to a certain degree with China\nUm [noise] and it's\nThe problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia yeah Riyadh and tear on it's going to continue um but it ... if you're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as his law in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging him off and\nYou know Palestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were\nWere they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another follow from that are positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the ... were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nAnd I do go to you with ... universal access at ... met\nUs on TV all access selected for over Twenty years\nAnd the bugs news on the hour more stimulating talk Ninety seven point one the big doctors on air and online it's the talk radio dot com\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis is with us before we go to the phones a Bob let me ask you the last three years well projecting into next year the Trump Administration is earmarked proximate lead to point to a to point three billion dollars increase\nDefense spending we had seven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year in another seven hundred coming up this year uh is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but is it enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to ... hours and that's why people often say well gosh\nYou know [noise] you know how can the Russians and the Chinese speech such an adversary and and competitive with while they hide most of what you're spending on their own national security you know the answer is we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must cut five percent well we went through this quest ration period in which you just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and train to be ready to fight to replace\nYou know with your new aircraft for these\nAntiques that we're trying to fly around the world and the same thing was ships\nYou know it's an incredibly expensive to have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of something that Ronald Reagan said you know this was you know obviously a few years ago and basically says that\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a modern armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested a furiously on all fronts by\nA both China and Russia especially combined a fair forming a new alliance and so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustain the investment in long term capabilities\nUh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics in artificial intelligence or even in investment in our our blue water navy uh\nUh the last couple of years have been great\nPoliticians are ... even in investment in our our blue water navy uh uh the last couple of years have been great and it's only putting us on our rights glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas good evening good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast thing yeah\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the uh Chinese tapping our electronics for information well what I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed to an end date into all of these electronic chips\nSo that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future\nYou know it's it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nQuick question Steve is that possible Bob\nWell I'm not an electronics are no expert however I Do understand the question and I share that concern a and that's something that I think that uh Jim Mattis our defense\nSecretary is concerned about that things like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we get a programmable and reversible inundated electronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nOr ships and it's and so forth and we could find that this could be catastrophic so you know I I think there's plenty of caution today\nA there's a wakeup call across or certainly the U.S military and I think our allies are are joining that understanding that this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful of of the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of um winter in the U.S spy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time\nUh I think it was maybe a near collision involved and and I'm I'm just I'm Wondering if that that might be what we're talking about here perhaps it was ... it was ... it landed there because of being hacked into somehow\nYou know well you know that's the sort of thing that we're very concerned about a cyber the battleground has the cyber as a woman before then I point out on the lines of evil and\nGo into great detail is two and not only the threat\nOf taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections and doing all sorts of things that uh we hear about every day you know this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the\nPresident's strategy and he says that there's a there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's how serious it is today and yet you know there's so much we don't know so you know could somewhat take on an aircraft could take down a satellite to take down to\nYou know Los Angeles I think all that is possible or if we don't put fire walls and the capabilities to prevent this in place\nOne card line Don his intent Ohio John good evening good morning welcome to coast\nBrother Robert happy Sabbath a and lieutenant colonel I I really appreciate your service your patriotism and you're with them during the main things that you have do they ever consider the Bible prophecy of Daniel eight where America will attack Iran and destroy it\n[noise]\nYou'd have to remind me of ... and Daniel late where you're looking at dawn I'm you know I I understand perhaps where you're coming from a you know I I don't know that ah that's something that we would do unless we perceive that the threat was\nA against you know our key allies and against our interest\nIn those five it claims that you know the he go from the west will come upon the whole face of the earth and will not touch the ground\nAnd it'll destroying the ram that has the two horns and said the the ladder horn is the bigger ... that comes up last them the first one would be Iraq that's already been conquered but the last one that comes up will be destroyed and claimed that no one will help\nIt says that you know a a nation that comes from the west will not touch the ground which means it's going to be a naval or an air force\nAttack or Iran is you know a huge country and that and uh but it's also states that no one will come to her aid\nAh and I find that kind of interesting since it has you know alliances with were actually North Korea China and uh uh Russia\nAh so you know it's a and this was a deal application prophecy also uh I Know Alexander the great a competent but he did not use\nOr anything but an infantry a probably a column a hundred and some yards wide they're not covered the whole earth as you know explain to you know this prophecy so ah and actually it also mentions that he go to I'm from the west will have her\nOr has the wing husband eagle and are those wings will be blocked in I have to stand up as a man so uh I didn't know if the joint chiefs are considered any of those biblical prophecy saying there are\nA summation of this whole incident over their\nGreat question Don Bob Let's say you\nKnow I I understand you know we're done is coming from the eagles certainly you know we like to think of as the United states and its\nIts use or elsewhere even in revelation\nOr the possibility of interpreting and like that you know I I tend to you know shy away from\nA uses Jesus and and going more in the direction of extra Jesus in terms of you know what's the context of that particular scripture [noise] I have not studied Daniel aid to the degree that Don or would\nYou know benefit from an analysis of that so I I really can't answer the question though I Would say that\nYeah it's not my experience that our chiefs of the armed forces are terribly a biblical illiterate and therefore are in tune with a Bible prophecy I'm not that they shouldn't be but I just don't get the sense that they are and certainly the material I read doesn't suggest that they have\nA Susan is on the wild card line and she's in

she not in the New York Mets are farm system ... football he's in baseball now like any\nYeah you know what's really interesting in baseball to this really fascinating but I mean the other is kind of like a when you see the halo you know that you know there's a symbol and Jesus is coming back you know that there's no doubt that the oldest coincidences were not coincidence that there are too many

later in that year people last like\nTwo or three of those games I Believe the later in the year when the big thing was when they were winning three games to two or whatever all of a sudden they lost

about ... if you'd like to be a part of this it's really easy to just give me a call caught me at a Tom talk gun that's the easy way Tom talked gun that'll get junior All right so we're talking about a lot of different\nParts of guns and shooting and you know can be competition shooting or be hunting rifles and hand loads a hint loading and shot guns handguns and and everything else all sorts of things one of the things we don't talk about very much but we should because there's a lot of interest in it\nIs for auto machine guns can you hold on what's involved how's that work\nWell to help me out on that I brought in good personal friend of mine dance Lincoln here's the president of the Louisiana shooting association and a veteran competition shooter can't Perry style rifle uh just got the

investor all of that\nBand cook questions for people that may not know what's involved as far as the paperwork is basically the same as like a suppressor\nIt's exactly the same as a suppressor a transfer transferable machine gun transfer or something like foreign for\nWhich is the same paperwork you fill out at your dealer when you get a suppressor are basically the dealer holds the machine gun until the paperwork goes through an is approved and these days I think it's taking about six or seven months for approval\nSo really not a big deal and it no more so than it was a pleasure\nWell I think that the the great interest in oppressors has taken a lot of the mystique away from machine gun ownership and people were said well if I'm going to fill out\nPaperwork for sb our first suppressor I might as well by a machine gun you got the money and that has driven the price of machine guns up\nWell which leads us to this question explain why Nineteen eighty sixes important date for a year for us\n\nA Ronald Reagan signed the firearm owners protection\nImportant date year for us [noise]\nA Ronald Reagan signed the firearm owners Protection Act into law in Nineteen eighty six in the last thing that was added to last amendment that was added to that act was supposed to be a poison pill to kill it\nCalled the huge amendment if you watch CSPAN at the time and listened to the vote it didn't\nSound like it passed but the Democrats were in charge and they declared that it had passed on a voice vote that grandfathered all previously registered machine guns but said basically that civilians you know citizens cannot register any new ... period I mean it was\nIt was made after that date in Nineteen eighty six you could not be registered correct\nWhich means there is a finite number you you can't they're not going to be any more um\n[noise] there is a finite number roughly between a hundred and Seventy five thousand than a hundred and eighty five miles and I haven't uh uh I don't\nIt's it's friday in between those two they lose about a thousand per year registered guns fires blow up whatever um so it's not just finite I mean it is actually on the\nPitch shrinking um the interesting thing is that\nWell in Nineteen eighty six or let's say Nineteen eighty two when I was in college Thompson submachine guns sold for seven hundreds of twelve hundred dollars mhm now\nYou're talking twenty thousand dollars for are transferable gun or maybe more you know I mean if it's if it's in super good condition or its original finish or if it's a rare variant of it it could be you know a lot more [noise]\nSo it's the talk about that auto series you should've bought a car loaded up\n[noise]\nBack in the eighties auto Sears four Seventy five dollars and my understanding where the dealers couldn't give them away because there was a two hundred dollar tax that had to be paid to buy the Seventy five Coloradans here\nIf you had if you had the forth all the foresight to report it registered in order to your back in the eighties for Seventy five dollars plus your two hundred dollar taxpayer today they sell for about thirty eight thousand dollars\n[laughter] super popular\nBecause they are Fifteen is so popular\nOh man that's better than buying Google or anything else so it's\nPretty much the best deal that was ever\nEver offered me like that because there's a finite number and actually the number of shrinking each year uh\nI Can't think of a better description of something that might be a good investment\n[noise] it is but like so many things you have to know what you're buying and you have to buy it right I mean now there's a saying that if you pay ... you never pay too much you just ... to early\n[laughter] but\nYou know if if you know what you're looking for and you can get a good deal on it it can be a very good investment um yeah I don't think they're going to [noise] to have the same increases they have in the in the past Thirty years\nBut they're going to go up they are not go up\nRight is there any reason if you bought one said well I'm going to put ... put in twenty thousand dollars in the stock market with three thousand dollars into a machine gun is there any reason not to shoot it while you're sitting on your investment\n[noise] the only reason I could think of if you had if you put some money into barring let's say an original cult that had an original barrel okay\nThere is a slight chance that if you got a squid load that ... because it's a machine gun than X. bullet going through could Bolger barrel and decreasing about okay sure so you wouldn't really want to do that but\nIf you were to buy 'em either a non matching see in Oregon or or to gun there's no reason not to go shoot those because you can just\nYou know take the burn off and replace it I'm\nNot sure the ... the real question that you know because it's the one you get all the time I'm thinking about it yeah I'd like to get into that even if they were all like to get a machine gun which ones should I start with\n[laughter] what's your pain level on price\n[laughter] well that's good to me like three different choices three different price levels\nOne of the least expensive entry level machine guns has traditionally been the Mac tenant Mac or whether I'm when I got into it which was only three years ago ... selling for about forty five hundred dollars today you can't touch one for under about seven thousand or Seventy five hundred\n... and this is mostly because they think they're so popular people started making accessories for them in order to make them more useful because you know I mean a Mac ... the old\nJoke around here I'm going to run out of time here so I'm gonna have to get you to move through the new selections as fast as we can't okay\nOkay um any of the two guns\nTypically cell from about eight thousand\nTo Fifteen thousand dollars and the mimic these ... or or reproduction sort of of a classic guns like in the forties Swedish case that type of stuff and you don't have to worry about shooting those because they're not\nThey're collectible because they're registered but they're not collectible as originals\nAnd then when you get to the originals I'm\n... I'm I'm Down to thirty seconds then let me come back to choices\nAnd the forty Thompson it'd be shown in popular yeah in every movie you've ever seen\nWith World War two [noise] yeah exactly and they're fun to shoot this new recall and you're just in the ... the slow cycling I mean I Love that it'd be forty years I got to get out you\nKnow rising thank you buddy I really appreciate it out of

in the community and to look gorgeous positive difference and hope of books out\nIn the region Stewart joined the firm is because he does have quite a financial background in your store number of years ago as a vice president at the chamber of commerce journal and then there's a little slice of chamber right and you know the thing is you know Stewart you really have a beautiful face for

an office here in Flagstaff downtown Flagstaff\nAs well as we have an office in Sedona that services or the tri city area which is you know\nThe ... what camp Verde area a plug down and so forth right low growth out there in in great opportunity to help even more folks\nWell I'm Glad to have you in CDL as well he learned and I know it's it's going to be hurting cats today with stuff have you back well the where\nWe just got an honorary today [laughter] they were here you're the roads between two story [laughter] we have already a coffee you know that's why we're ready to go I capital\nI got my work cut out for me that you know one of the things we're going to focus on today that we were chatting about a little bit off line\nIs financial wellness and how much having a healthy mind and body really goes hand in hand with having healthy finances that you know what most of us know what to expect when we go in for a checkup on our physical health\nBut we don't know what to expect for a financial checkup so that's where I'd like to begin today in garnish how do we get started with that\nWell you know me being a doctor on radio so I think I guess I can talk about financial help [laughter] so I've always talked to people about a financial checkup\nIs extremely important and you know you have to have just like you would go get your you know oil changed on every three thousand miles and it's funny in our industry is that the you know there's a saying in our industry that guys take better care of their vehicles and take care of their health you know\nAnd in women live longer because they take better care of their health and so that's kind of the important aspect of what we're doing here\nOne of the things we found was that like you're supposed to do\nA physical every year with a doctor in and get a check up and so for doing that on your finances extremely important as well because you know a lot of times you don't realize there's a problem and you know you're too far down the road\nAnd you know there is any kind of corrections or strategy change that has to happen we want to be able to implement and make those changes as soon as necessary\nWe're talking today with ... he's the owner and founder of our financial group and see where it may Daniel is here with us as well he's part of the team that for a financial and I'm generally alongside it gives the retirement ... power to pay for a financial group\nIs that when you get in your car and you start driving\nAnd the first stop you would say would be you know like going if you're an ice forty you'll be going towards Williams so first off would be Williams then it'd be so like women then you'd be Kingman\nSo theoretically when you're looking at this you're not getting to check your tires and things like that until you get to a gas station right and if you need gas that's what you're doing\nBut what happens is if there's a problem in between that distance you're absolutely unaware of four fifty sixty ... even a hundred miles versus what happens in retirement planning\nIs that a lot of times people say you don't you know check a couple of years or ... ... most of the most of what we've seen is that people have come in and they said you know I had a financial plan done ten years ago\nMhm and I go and then what and they go ... ... ... years ago and I think we're on track I I don't know I I go how can you be so sure or are you sure and\nMost people I sit down with they really don't know if they're on track or not they just goes you know life is happening and\nWe have an advisor that's kind of managing our accounts and I think we should be good when most people don't realize is when I first started in this industry back in the early nineties\nThe rate of return or projections that were being used were significantly higher than what we consider using today and I was speaking to another financial advisor in our community\nAnd realize that they're using a pretty robust rate of return in projections on their portfolio so you know it always looks like you're going to make so much more money and then you create your spending plan around how much money you think you're going to have\nAn intern you're good to have a significant shortfall because it didn't perform up to that level and so part of this also is we won't talk about risk management you know if you look back you know this year will use this year as an example I I don't want to go very\nDated on the timing but if you just look back this year we've had significant volatility in the market and the recent months uh we've had quite a bit and I think people don't realize if the markets are up or down because you know and sometimes they turn on the TV and it says\nYou know the S. and P. hits new highs are Dow Jones industrial average has hit new\nAnd they think that they're making all this money but then they don't realize that too after that the Dow Jones industrial as gun that over five hundred points or something like that you don't know maybe several thousand points in like in that case so those are the kinds of things that\nIsrael has gone out of a five hundred voice or something like that you write or maybe several thousand points in like\nIn that case so those are the kinds of things that you know when we create a plan that's where we're at dress we're really addressing the safety component of your plan so here's the thing if you're going to Los Angeles and here\nAnd the road map you know your Google Drive or whatever you you have any more what do you call them nowadays\nWherever the navigation system navigation ... yeah ... ... you know I I still go back and think about you know like I was thinking about the Rand McNally road atlas writes most of us travel ban on the day before all this stuff came out\nYou know we have to we actually had to lay it out and make a plan and really understand that you know if you drove respectable speed limit and you know considering traffic and so for that you would get to your destination\nIn a certain period of time and that's where people are really losing the focus is that you know too much electronics is in the way too much garbage is going in their heads from watching TV and so forth\nAnd everybody's chasing returns what I mean by that is that you know people are looking to make as much money as possible but they don't realize what the downside stroke up that would be right\nAnd if you just kind of go back and look at\nWhat happened to two thousand seven two thousand Ayn short here in Tucson at that time I was younger than you saw your big cities even worse\nWell absolutely seeing folks there were a hundred percent quite into real estate because at the time you know the real estate market was booming in the early two thousand ... and things were great until it wasn't and people lost half of\nTheir their value overnight they couldn't give it away correct right and we just saw people were unprepared and and they didn't have that they didn't realize that things aren't going to keep going the same way whether it's up or down into not panic and then up a whole holistic approach\nBut it also provides opportunities as well you know how to\nWrite so you know I mean you know when we look at the markets so we're seeing you know we have big upswing in the market and then you see big down swing in the market right and\nThen we see panic and we see we do you get to see all kinds of emotions right you know greed fear panic all that stuff right anger and you know we were we find is that when people don't have a plan emotions get the best of it\nRight and and bad things you know we we all go through difficulty throughout her day right that doesn't mean it's going to ruin our day\nAnd then that's the whole thing that we have a plan to move forward whatever it might be as we're going on vacation going on a trip whatever it is now we have a plan to move forward and that and that's how we approach or the financial plans as well and how important that is because without that plan that's when the panic that thing\nThat we've had a bull market for probably a decade at this point right and it's been well you know like I mean if you look at the ten years the markets been up but you know the volatility that's have come into play has been pretty significant in two thousand eleven you know if you're just at home and one\nFor giggles if you look at the Dow chart in two thousand eleven\nAnd you go back and look at two thousand seven two thousand a charge he was an exact mimic the markets and the charts for exactly mimicking that instead of going down\nWhat happened was the federal government stepped in and then they get infused much money in the market right and that's what kind of ... the mark it up and it's gone up since the end you know in the long term we see the markets will go up by the fact is that\nIf there's a major market correction\nAnd you know you are retired and you're reliving off this money\nAnd you're taking out say a thousand a couple of thousand maybe even three thousand dollars a month out of that account\nAnd your portfolio overnight just got chopped in half because the markets went down right and you're just you know thinking it's a short term volatility and usually you know in in oh seven or eight when the market corrected\nThat was it all happened within six months and that was considered a short term volatility but he was a major market correction and if you know anyone that's retired um and they're retired in those seven away\nAnd if you're thinking about retirement and you're not really thinking about rescue should have a conversation with one of these folks that were affected by this and you probably know them and\nWhat happened there was if they were taking money out out of their investment accounts or the IRA count\nAs it's chopped in half because markets went down and they took him seven years to get back to where they were but if you're drawing against it\nYou will never recovered that money and there's a great chance that you will run out of money a lot sooner and blunt nice speaking I beat this wrecking ball we always talked about pendulum you know when the market's going one way it's beautiful you know everybody's smiling and laughing\nAnd giggling swing vent pendulum swings the other way it's a wrecking ball you know who is into a portfolio and you know like Stewart was a part of the\nOf mortgage company and you know what was your title and more movies banker\nOr else the mortgage banker first magazine a financial and yeah the company went out of business right behind it and that happened to a lot of folks I mean companies that were highly leveraged didn't up again plan a for for long term or the issues and and that's what happened with them\nAnd you know and the thing is that most people have to have a significant um analysis that she does the analysis done to understand what kind of risk they can actually afford to take right and you know we we do run into a lot of people say well you\nKnow I have bombs to my portfolio that safe I don't know how to answer this question but I always say you know once you call people that own the LA county bonds reds would last more they went bankrupt right or not by choice\nRight and you know I mean you can go down the line and you know they're in depending on what kind of bonds you're buying but you know I mean there's still a significant risk associated with it the other thing we also look at uh when we talked about the risk portion of it is that uh the fed has been talking about they're going to raise the interest rate\nAnd what happens in bonds that most people don't\nThink about they think most people are taught wrong but they are taught that stock market and bond market work against each other meaning their their stocks are off the bombs are going to be down and bonds are up the stocks are going to be down well that is not true what effects\nThe bond market is the interest rate in the interest rate is going up the bonds are going to go down in value and if you know if the interest rate goes down the bombs go up in the ice if you just mentally see a seesaw\nAnd if you put bonds on one side and you put the interest rate on the other side and if one thing\nUp the other one's going to go down so you just keep that in mind so you know we always talked about creating safe strategies in retirement so if you're listening to the show and I actually have a gift for you\nThe risk against the safety that idea nudey would be the safe component that is correct but a lot of times what the advisors are doing is that they have their clients' money in the market and they sold clients pay annuity variable annuity just to generate additional revenues for their for their company\nAnd it's a it's a revenue approach it wasn't a holistic approach to planning\nAnd so that's one side of it right so let's talk about the the kind of annuities that we feel good about and we like and those are called fixed annuities right now fixed annuity is not going to make you rich if you think you're buying a fixed annuity because you're going to end up with double your money in five years it\nAin't happening right now I'm looking at a guaranteed right of return and how right that is right in the idea behind that was really used to you know the annuities the fixed annuities are designed not to make you rich but it's actually design\nFrom keeping you from becoming poor right and so within a fixed uh nudey a family\nThey have one called indexed\nSo it's got fixed indexed annuity and the fix component means that your principal is not going to go down\nAnd index so everybody's heard about index funds would index funds to his mimic the stock market the U.S and be five hundred the Dow Jones industrial average or you could have been asked to actually get a Russell one thousand two thousand three thousand I mean if you were going right there's a whole list of things you could index and so forth\nSo these annuities actually have where your rate of return on your fix nudity\nIs linked\nTo the performance of an index and you're not going to make as much money as the index and you'll never make as much money as the index but what happens is that when indices go down\nYour money doesn't go down so if you take say I'm just using as an example we had a hundred thousand dollars in let's say you make five thousand dollars in interest on that now that hundred and five thousand dollars with the fixed annuity becomes part of your principal meaning it's locked in it doesn't ever go backwards\nStock market goes down fifty percent guess what you get a big fat zero\nFor returns and distill it the one oh five now still at one of five right in the markets come up that one of five will go up to whatever the next you know growth numbers and unlock itself but you know the thing is that you give up some of the upside gain\nTo have what's very important which is downside protection because the bombs don't do that the stocks don't do that the mutual funds to undo that exchange traded funds to do it and the variable annuities don't do that\nThe real life you know the actual value of your portfolio will go down and most of those all almost all of those products\nExcept for the fixed annuity that peace of mind offering protection of your nest egg right and so if you just joined us you know we just talked about variable annuities and we do what's called a new T. analysis

learn more about them at Boris financial dot com that's for the next year oh our a financial dot com or the number for you to call you have questions about some of the things you've been talking about today Ninety\nRate cheesecake eighty two fifty five that's Ninety rate sex talk\nAnd they tell me a little bit of that risk management how do we now if we have the right amount of risk\nSo for starters you know when we talk about his rule of one hundred so some people have heard it and you know we've talked about this on the show in the past\nBut if you took one hundred and if you subtract your age from that\nSo assuming that let's say somebody sixty years of age rights or you subtract sixty from one hundred answers forty and what that means is a forty\nPercent of your\nInvestment portfolios should be associated with risk\nAnd sixty percent of your money should be somewhere safe and you know we talked earlier that you know people have the false sense of security when they own bonds or you know even they own variable annuities that have income riders and things of that nature\nAnd those things I consider those false sense of security because we were looking for is what is your real dollar war\nNot an income writer but real dollar and so in this case where we talked about is if you do take sixty percent of your uh investment or you know sixty percent of your account value and that should be somewhere safe\nAnd you know you could put that in CDs money market accounts but what do they pay today\nDo you know now that is\nWell almost nothing nothing right it almost ... so what happens there is if it even if ... percent doesn't matter but the thing is that you're going broke very\nSafely and you don't realize that you're going broke right because your money's not keeping up with inflation so unique your money working do or at least keeps up with inflation that means you're seeing even Stephen\nBut we're we're focusing on is actually growing it a little bit more than that so that you always have the growth factor associated with it\nEspecially as your expenses go up you actually do better than inflation correct because as your expense to go up you're going to help caustic cetera\nIf most people don't realize but their pension you know people were thinking that far ahead but they you know oh they're so worried about retiring and having enough\nMoney when they retire they don't realize that the cost of living adjustments like you were you when you were working and you got to two percent pay increase or or three or four whatever or some of ... so are you listening gold\nMine for hasn't given me a raise in five years you know because I mean there are some people that just you know aren't structured that way but most most times when people are working\nTheir cost of living adjustment as a as their income goes up every single year\nBut what happens in this case is that most pensions\nDo not have it cost of living adjustments so today you know the milk like we talked about in the past were laughing about um you were on the show but we had talked about when I first started driving you know gas prices were like eighty nine cents a gallon and\nI remember that you do write of flew under a hundred dollar for\nDollar right and so by the time I actually graduated high school\nOr the prices have actually gone up over like dollar Thirteen or so and you don't you know what I mean today if you look at it it's you know whatever the price I Love to have those kind of gas prices again right [laughter] yeah that'd be fun [laughter] but that was inflation right and today I just just ordinary were just talking to a client of ours\nAnd they ended up buying a new vehicle and I asked him I said would you pay for the vehicle and and they told me the number and I said do you realize that your parents first house\nWill cost less\nThan what you pay for your vehicle today right and they're like that is so true you know that is so true and so you know we're looking for understanding how the inflation is going to impact", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "20"}
