E. V. I. N. for Hillsdale dot com\nOr something I'm politically different [laughter] mariners review\nMore stimulating ah\nPleasure that have John games on the program he's the Republican nominee for the United States Senate in Michigan or the election is next Tuesday a week for now but I it's a Mr james it's an honor to have you on the program thank you\nFor having me Arctic or wherever I'm as early voting in Michigan oh we have out in the balloting but ah but no early voting that would make you know in other states\nAll right so it's very important that people get out on election day in Michigan tell us about your race but the key issues are in your opponent to\nOf course well ah the the thing about this race we have the opportunity to move forward I'm a combat veteran a wire veteran West Point graduate or who served in Iraq and Operation Iraqi freedom of seven do die for seven hundred and fifty hours combat\nOr over there and I came back to grow my family business I'm fro thirty five million a hundred and thirty seven million but most importantly created a hundred jobs and around the country I Believe that having experience a in combat helped me to understand national security I'm In a way that my opponent camp and understand veterans' issues\nI Believe that having experience a in combat helped me to understand national security I'm In a way that my opponent can't and understand veterans' issues in a way that my opponent has failed to but also a business standpoint understanding how to grow our economy but also create economic opportunity for people who have been failed\nFor decades my opponent is a forty three year career politician who spent Twenty years in Washington in Eighteen years as a senator and in that Eighteen years she's only accomplish getting five her co sponsored bills into law three of which are to rename buildings I I truly believe that we have folks in Washington or legislating regulator teachers are not going to be a part of\nAnd that this will not change until until we stand up and take our government back\n[noise] and it's amazing how long has she been in the Senate\nShe's been in the center for Eighteen years\nAnd she's been in state government forever to right\nYes she was actually I'm a first elected a forty three years ago in Nineteen Seventy five one nasty year the year now more efficiently ended yet a number of weeks ago she stood in front of a veteran service organization\nAnd said that she was unaware of veterans issues that they weren't all her radar screen we have been at war for over a decade and a half and we still haven't welcome to our Vietnam veterans back properly and this didn't make it at a high priority list that's unacceptable\nI get to Washington I'm going to make sure that we prioritize our veterans that we prioritize healthcare would prioritize education to make sure that everybody has access to the American dream\nNow your website is John James for Senate dot com so if people want to contribute to your campaign all over the country and people in Michigan want to get involved in the last week you got campaign they go to John James for Senate dot com correct\nThat's right they can also follow me on Facebook and Twitter at jobs and and I mean let me tell you I'm\nThis racism played with my candidacy\nOut when we first started out we were twenty three point down and as of last by six points down but as we all know the liberals have done a wonderful job\nOf shaming people and bullying people and to not expressing their opinions and so given the fact that straight ticket voting is not no longer allowed in Michigan and the fact that conservatives don't poll we vote I Believe that we even closer than that um the last quarter we always Debbie Stabenow\nBruce point six million our three point six million to her one point eight\nOr so doubled are up there and between October first and October seventeenth because of uh of your listeners in some very faithful grassroots army\nUm folks were on the state and around the country we raise two million dollars to her a four hundred and Seventy one thousand we have the momentum and his race and uh by your help and assistance but we're going to win this thing under ...\nTell me a tell me about the the two or three or four issues that you think are paramount\nUh well I I mentioned them a veterans' issues I Believe that our veterans are facing\nI'll let me let me let me address it this way economically the president seems to be doing the the right thing your your opponent opposed the tax cuts I assume you would have supported them absolutely\nYour opponent supports massive bureaucracy with massive regulations without a legislative authority from Congress that that affects Democrats Republicans and every kind of business whether it's car manufacturing or small businesses I\nAssume you support the the direction in which the administration is going\nAbsolutely and and this is part of the problem uh right now or you have people in Washington like Debbie Stabenow who are trying to legislate a ... legislate industries they'd never run a business before and right now the over burdensome regulation the over taxation is creating a environments\nThat are actually shipping jobs off\nOr to to places like China and Mexico in Turkey a and then selling those goods into compete with us or that they're going to be ah that that the that the administration is is now correcting I Believe that by supporting a pro business environment it helps to run a bring all ship stuff\nAnd the folks that are now not only failed to vote for the tax cuts in jobs that that also created opportunities owns a in rural and urban areas around the country but she's also voted to raise our taxes hundreds of times over the past Eighteen years she's not a a friend of business she's not a good economic growth\nAnd uh I'll tell you a she supports the socialist\nUm ah agenda that will bankrupt our children's future\nAnd she goes back to Michigan\nAnd she tries to appeal to Republicans independence blue collar workers by by doing this I'm a moderate I'm a centrist I can work with the other side but she's hardcore left than she votes for ... to be ah the leader of the Democrats and she votes against cabin on she basically is a reliable left wing vote correct\nA marker is even worse than that uh according to the man is now a happened now despite all of her ah using bipartisanship is a buzzword is the sixty ninth most bipartisan senator in the United States Senate that puts her more liberal than Elizabeth Warren\nDebbie Stabenow is more liberal than Elizabeth Warren and she supports things that that that many people in the state a state that Donald Trump won\nAbsolutely find reprehensible a lot of cases I soon and stuff and I was not bipartisan in fact she goes to suction was Ninety five percent of the time and Hillary Clinton Ninety three percent of the time and that's a solid a is a New York's ... that's a failure and leadership she does not represent Michigan She represents New York and that needs to change that have been for six\n[noise] have you been interviewed much by big media by NBC ABC CBS have you been interviewed much by CNN or MSNBC\nNo um I've uh I've been interviewed by a by Fox and the and a bunch of local area is a local stations here um but um but that that that's kind of indicative of the situation with them by not allowed to\nStacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum are talking about their first but I Will you talk about the uh the first a Republican or the first the first African American senator from the state of Michigan and only the third since the sixties um\nYou you hear crickets I'm from a from the uh the the liberal or progressive media uh we we really are just praying hard and working hard and getting the word out there and as I mentioned are fundraising and our uh our polling numbers of have this race and play I think we're going to walk a lot of people and ...\nI

illustration of how low the media\nHave become in this country in the aggregate with their group thing\n\nThe rabbi at a synagogue where the slaughter occurred\nHad to push back on our sink camera rada on CNN who was begging him to trash truck\nAnd other congregants that Congress get from the synagogue had a pushback against handwritten metro at MSNBC begging him to trash truck I've never seen such just pick 'em up conduct in my life these people these so called journalists\nHave ice water and their veins\nIf they gave a damn about the current events that took place they weren't conduct themselves this way\nAnd their political opportunists\nOnce something not who likes Bernie Sanders are shooting at Republicans critically wanting one nobody blames Bernie Sanders in the media wasn't rising is being sent that Trump the trumps kids\n\nTo people and his administration term Republican senators we don't hear all this quiet that\nFrom about the Democrats from the media when I hear it\n\nAnd yet here we have made his slaughtered eleven human beings who hate Jews and hates Trump and you knew\nThe media Jim Acosta Andrea Mitchell Alison camaraderie Chris Cuomo Don Lemon and all the rest of them Jake Tapper you know that they were gonna\nTurn the blame on Trump it's the tone of Trump you say because before Trump everything was really great the nation was United Obama talked in prose of wisdom mine was the nicest guy in the world we never had the Bork hearings the the uh Clarence Thomas\nHearings we never had the attacks on Reagan well not when I read any of this stuff\nAnd it was so much peace in our politics before Trump wasn't there of course there was they downplay the antifa they dare not speak of black black lives matter and as far as ... concerned embraced by that Democrats with a wink and nod\n\nTen days ago I called juice termites you got barely know coverage\n\nAnd Steve Schmidt is a ... he said the ... he said they're shocked and enjoy reading a book he said the Andrea Mitchell and the Allison camaraderie help\nThis guy is a parasite\nUsa campaign operatives for Republicans like John McCain he was on the outs with Trump\n\nLike the other ... Wallace\nAnd so they're on a mission\nLeast Trump haters whether it's Scarborough or that clown makeup or ... or not call wall I started this guy or another jerk Rick Wilson they're all out there all twelve ... twelve\n\nAnd MSNBC and CNN and the rest like to tell you oh these are Republicans are former Republican you know and even they hate Trump yeah one Ninety percent of the Republican support\n\nBut I Want to show you how ...\n\nI Want to show you how sick thing this gets I'm getting an award from the Zionists of America organization on Sunday I received an award a few months ago from Emmett they know the pro Israel organization\n\nI went over to Israel to watch the ceremony the opening of our embassy Andrews\nI broadcast as you know from Israel for three days the ... ... so many great people America loving Israeli\nNinety percent of the Israeli people support Trump's actions with respect to Israel almost the converse in our own country but you understand\n\nA president who so proud of his daughter Ivanka Trump she's an Orthodox Jew so proud of his step son Jared Kushner an Orthodox Jew so proud of his three grandchildren from a couple all Orthodox Jews\n\nAnd the mass murder was right he's surrounded by Jews and Christians too but you get the point\n\nWe had the ambassador from Israel on\nThis program ...\nYou get the point\nWe had the ambassador from Israel on this program ... and he said that this president is the greatest friend Israel's ever had in the presidency and it's not even close\n\nThe Anti Defamation league has led by a former special assistant to Iraq Obama they pounced with practice president they don't represent this Jew I can tell you that\n\nThere's a left wing progressive organization of so called Jewish leaders quote unquote backed by ... son he's been they've been quoted all over the media\nThat they don't want Trump in Pittsburgh who do\nNot represent any body just left wing coats but there by the synagogue said I'm a citizen and he's the president of course we welcome despite being pressed by CNN\nThe other member of the synagogue same thing they thought they you sure what the tone the pride that that says I think the politics says as I recall this guy didn't like Trump\n\nSees Steve Schmidt yesterday on MSNBC caught one do we have to\nForty percent of the country has opted into an alternate reality\nNow ... so you folks who support Trump or are Republicans\nYou're mentally ill so you're in an alternate reality if a person's in an alternate reality they're mentally ill\nSo here you go this guy is condemning millions of people who he happens to disagree with your in an alternate reality that is what counts as serious analysis and MSNBC do\nWe have to wake up in this country and understands the danger of it there's presents to all of us we can't put our heads in the sands Kellyanne Conway the danger\nWhat represents the all of us the mass murder yes but he's talking about Trump\nThe danger he

you [noise]\nI'm fine and yourself better than I deserve what's up\nWhat is your household income sure\nOh combined it clear about eighty five\nOkay you have any car debt Carter mhm I'm no we don't our cars are paid off okay what are your car's worth\nUm I Would say about twenty thousand combined okay All right\nWell here's the facts that the quote unquote financial advisor to know um apparently or he wouldn't have given you stupid but advise student loans are not bankrupt double\n\nYour we did talk about that during the conversation they never go away but he was drinking entirely because of the amount of credit card that we have\nBob are really really have allied um at wait a minute this moron suggested your bankrupt with thirty four thousand dollars with a credit card debt with a household income of eighty five thousand that's absurd dude\nThat's what I was thinking\nThat's absurd 'cause the ... that is a hundred thousand dollars for a student loan doesn't change anything because it's it's gonna be there regardless smaller bankrupt ... so we're dealing with you're going to file bankruptcy and thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five no you should pay it off in one year\nAnd a year yeah one year live on fifty paid off in one year take six extra jobs shelves so much stuff you can't breathe you know eating out no vacations and you're a hundred percent debt free in one year what are your car's worth\n\nYour car the work recording okay each\nUm her a newer models are older so\nWhereas ours or who are hers hers is worth what about Thirteen thousand mine of about seven mhm okay\nWell um you can do what you want to do I if I woke up in your shoes I have to tell you I've worked with families that were in dire straits over the years that were forced into bankruptcy you're not one of those\nIf you choose to file bankruptcy is just cause you to get young lazy to address the situation let's even say you did it over two years it's only Seventeen five a year and your debt free other than your student loan which I'm not talking about the student loans will be going in one year\nIn five a year and your debt free other than your student loan which I'm not talking about the student loans will be going in one year I'm Talking about the credit card debt to be going in one year\nSo how fast do normal people that call the Dave Ramsey show that work our plan pay off a hundred and thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five about four years probably\n... yeah\nThat's the normal routine for people around here that would be student loans and everything and um you know I I Would not move down in the car initially\nOut of your wife's car into a into a six thousand dollar or five thousand dollar car initially I might end up doing that as we go along we'll see how it goes what do you do for a living sir\nI'm operations manager\nI'm okay and what does she do for a living through the pastor okay All right cool um does she ever do any outside speaking for money\nI'm no windows ... for about a gun or does she do speaking Miami does she speak on Sunday Morning\nYes he does very well be buried under okay All right\nI mean I Wonder if if you know she might feel do some ... occasionally for somebody that was ill or on sabbatical or something in that congregation pay or a little bit or maybe she works and evangelists to outrage and they pay you are a little bit for speaking skills or maybe dot dot dot you do something I don't know\nI mean if you add ten Fifteen thousand dollars a year to this equation\nOf income and you guys tightened down your budget and nothing I mean nothing where\nYou have no life because we're going to clean this mess up you know you can clean up the whole thing in four years maybe three but four for sure\nUh any clear up those student loans really really really fast as a part of that equation I'm Sorry the credit card debt as a part of that equation really really fast but you've got to cut them up you've got to quit using them and you gotta stop living the way you been living goes is not working agreed\nOn despair is that makes sense yeah for like you know\nThe Bible says that no discipline seems pleasant\nAt the time\nBut it yields harvest of righteousness you guys make good money so I Know you're not stupid people you're\nNot dumb ... you're not dumb\nYou just been doing some dumb things which makes you just like most of it was added a lot of dumb things in my life do\nA lot of money in particular has high end up teaching is 'cause I got a P. H. D. and D. U. N. B.\nBut um you know how to I don't know who it was it gave you this advice but you need to stay away from them\nBecause they gave you really really bad advice that's my opinion I think you can not only can work through this I think you should work through this\nI think it'll be a testimony to God's power and you're all his life that you turn this around and that you attack at an attack at an attack at and that you can start having a sense of self control the sense of discipline and it'll change your marriage on communication levels in lower the stress when you're working the plan together\nAnd you can do anything how old are you guys\nUh two twenty a town I just turned thirty two\nExcellent show when you're thirty six and she's thirty two year debt free as I feel\nSorry for

...\n... ... and and what do you make a make fifty two thousand a year\nYou can't hire somebody cheaper and fifty two thousand dollars a year to work in the back office shipping stuff would that be

and ten thousand so far this year\nI don't care what she groceries okay unless you're going to add more to her business in savings okay or in revenue than what you are making now than it is not making

Do [laughter] well my wife and I would get free for our health mhm and we've got a one and a half year old little boy yeah hey and\nWe want to [laughter] we want to play and prove college but before he goes to college is most likely for a faith going to sort of a two year mission right and I know that probably doesn't apply to the the college savings plans mhm\n[noise] we've got a chunk of money right now about seven thousand dollars that we're going to put some land but we're trying to decide whether we should put it down on a mortgage which one way or the other will be paid off before he goes yeah\nOr by a couple of good uh wars from invest in something um who could build up that future mission in college fund\nGotcha okay and your debt free except your home cooked in addition to the\nSeven thousand dollars do you have an emergency fund a rainy day fund up\nThree to six months of expenses we'd do you how much is in that\nAbout the\nGood okay well you're out what we call baby step for five and six baby step ones with thousands saved too is that free but tiles\nThree is a fully funded emergency fund\nBaby steps for is putting Fifteen Percent of your household income\nInto retirement which you should just start doing that as a part of your savings you're investing plan right now maybe step five is kids college and beyond that six is pay extra on the house as you can as fast as you can\nShow what I Would do with his own money is I Would hear a market for school and mission\nTrip 'cause you guys are obviously LDS right we are yeah OK\nCool so what what I'm going to do is say out of the seven thousand I'm probably going to drop five thousand of it into a five twenty nine for my one and a half year old into a good growth stock mutual fund that's all for college has to be used for college\nTake the other two thousand and just settled in a mutual fund in\n\nWith us from Springfield, Missouri I remember the days are due due to what's up [noise]\nUm my husband and I we just finished SPAM our on babysat to and for the last five years we have been building our home paycheck to paycheck\nAnd um it's not a hundred percent completed yet we had to borrow money on it or to kind of get things rolling a little bit but um\nWe got an offer to give the care taking position and the guy said that it's a four hundred dollars a month to take care of his vacation home I'm In the same town we live\nUm [noise] do we tell our home\nOr do we keep it and continue to make a payment on it\nIt's not completed well it [noise] we're at a point it means a paint and flooring and you're living in it no no um well we were living in a mobile home um\nBut then we got that offer to live in this house basically for free and he pays a live here and take care of\nI got that are okay so that's part of that show you've never lived in this other house no okay it's gonna be a little tough to sell it and the conditions than yeah like they can't get financing on it right so you're going to take a whipping\nA what will it take money wise to finish it\nI'm\nLike never had a professional answer on that but probably about\nEight thousand ten thousand dollar yeah and what is your household income um well my husband he worked forty hours a week what her household income [noise]\n[noise]\nProbably thirty seven thousand a year okay so your husband's the only one working well we have a business um that doesn't make it out and running it doesn't make money\nHere then comments about twenty five thousand and other than that makes about Fifteen thousand nearly okay and then getting the care taking condition or it'll be like in about forty eight hundred\nNearly okay\nAnd then getting care taking condition or it'll be like in about forty eight hundred cash but we get housing for free\nYeah I got that part until you get until he decides he doesn't want you to care take anymore and then you don't have housing for free anymore\nThat time so I mean he could walk into more on fire you pretty much I changed my mind and then you you have a housing issue again right so um\nYou have any idea what the house you have shorter built would bring as it is\nUm [noise] well we had an appraisal and if it were completed it might be about a hundred and sixty thousand a smart completed so probably a hundred and fifty hundred and twenty five\nNo no not if it's not completed it won't know um because ... it's a further discounts and the cost it takes to complete it it's a lot further discount because basically the typical consumer cannot bothers house okay\nBecause they don't have any money and they're trying to get a mortgage and they can't get a mortgage on this house\nAnd so that limits your in but they didn't limit your selling tool to investors and they're going to discount that I'm a lot deeper than that if you get a hundred out of there should be flying I'm thinking so um [noise] how much will be borrowed against it so far\nUh [noise] about how the south we owe thirty thousand but they're from property attached to a tell all together in a hundred thousand\n\nYou owe a hundred thousand against the house and the property yeah which would bring a hundred and sixty if it were fixed if you sold the property is well\nYes okay alright\nYeah I I Would look at trying to pick up the other ten thousand dollars in an additional loan and get this house finished and let's get it so as soon as possible\nAnd then just continue tanning nine and ... yeah\nYeah we all have you know I should have some equity in your pocket at that point I mean I'm not a ton but you're going to get a little money out of it so you know it it just hasn't worked out for you you realize that right yeah\nYou've got way too many hours in this house and and really didn't get much out of it went all the smoke clears here right you'll get a little bit but it's not it's not it's not worked out very good so you know you're going to have to reset that and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you guys need to look at your income\nBecause your household income as you I'm very very low income and ah so I I Want to think about careers what can we do to get our income up long term and I want to think about some part time jobs in the meantime\nBut um yeah I Would get that house finished up I'm saving scratching clawing painting and [noise]\nYou know if you borrow three thousand bucks or something that's fine but let's let's try and get it sold as fast as possible now if the land is such that you can sell off a piece of the land without selling the house in order to have the money to finish the house that's what I Would do first\nCelebrated showing acre also corner use that money to finish the house then get the household and that way there's no more debt involved\nOlivia is with us in Lexington high Olivia how are you\nGoing to hire you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nAnd I had a question and I cannot get and I'm wanting to pay that off like [noise] I'm about an hour or so and I have a story and it actually and and that is going to pay so [noise]\nAnd I ... ... budget and\nPet therapy at the end it's likely not going to get paid and how kind of an adequate that I'm not really sure way to pay in the budget [noise] or how big of a priority like\nHow long you been clean and the only good for you well then what is it [noise] and ... what are they okay All right\nWell no I'm not going to put therapy on hold right now this was something you need you need some accounts for a walk with you as you finish this life transformation and that that is essential to you having a life would you agree with that statement yeah\n[laughter] now what I Would do\nIs is number one it's not a permanent situation um the therapies not permanent is not going to be there the rest of your life fifty years from now you're not going to still be going to the therapist okay I Hope I'm and then uh otherwise\nTherapists just not very good [laughter] but ah at some point you'll you'll pull back from that and the second thing will happen is is that as you continue to address your income injure outgo you're going to find ways to make more income and as you have more emotional healing\nYou're going to feel more energized to make more income and so if this month\nYou don't pay any extra on the debt that you pay your therapy good\nIf next month the same thing happens okay\nBut by this time next year we ought to be making more money right let's do something let's kick her life and gear and let's start to clean up the debt ... to ... for today Seventy five whole days you been clean\n[laughter] that's a great start right but it's not like you told me you've been clean for two years by the time you calling for two years we ought to be have different having a different conversation about the money would that make sense to you [laughter] so let's get Hugh healed and then let's see oh your money\nAnd as you and it's not going to be suddenly like a switch flips and you go OK I'm OK Now get into money no it's not all or nothing it's going to be gradual it'll be incremental\nYou'll feel better you you know when you're Ninety Days or your four months you ought to feel different than you feel right now and you ought to be able to do more and make more and save more and more and\nYou know you you all have more focus on the money 'cause you'll be more healed and have to spend less severe emotional energy just coming through this right now your game on just getting through this is that right\n[laughter] okay well I Want you to finish turning the corner you turn the corner you finish turned the corner and let's\nLet's gone out and then as you make incremental progress move more and more than money from your new in Germany or increased income to\nThe best shot but for today we want to take care of a movie [noise]\nYou're doing a good job and you're so\nThis is the director show [noise]\nHow often do you look at your bank account and wonder where all your money went how often are you stressed about bills and afraid your paycheck last the whole month you shouldn't have to live like that you shouldn't feel powerless over your money and you don't have to you can take control of your money\nUm and those are you know that those things that we really thought it was sort of a recovery is opening thing because we're starting to do things right and really what I see now is that he was preparing us through what was what was about to come which is that we have a we have three boys the youngest is ten months [noise]\nAnd uh our youngest has Down syndrome\nAnd so uh right now we're actually coordinating the legacy journey class at our church and or just getting to the\nPart where we're ah we're working on it will join hands so because we have this special needs a issue we we get involved or attorney and getting our wheels together good and through that conversation we uh you know I'm\nA we've been discussing a special needs trust or oil that has to play in planning for our baby's future yeah your animal ...\nSure uh originally a kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs stress kind of function the same way that the other point of a college fund in baby steps five\nUm the uh and that we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special conditions and special rules because of course ah you know his his features are boring sport too early to know what is\nIt fully what it needs are we've been blessed that he's healthy developing well you know there's this guy limit for him just like anyone mhm um and we don't have to ah [noise] ah you know it's hard to really didn't know if he ever have any limitations [laughter]\nBut uh but now as far as I'm getting into it and we haven't found anything quite yet\nBut it would come down to the wire why things that I'm uncomfortable with is that you know if I start investing any money or finding try I I lose control of that to the track the that we've named and while while I trust the truck the inability to go with I Wish if that makes me uncomfortable\nNo you don't you don't need a special needs trust unless both of you die right the special needs trust does not need to be funded prior to your dad okay so that\nIt it sounded from your wealth or your life insurance until you've got wealth\nOkay\nAnd it's not ... I wouldn't even have it formed accept upon both deaths both of you dying okay as long as ... as long as one of us alive to manage your assets one of the things you're going to do is care\nFor this child that flew out of those assets now they don't win the trust is needed is if both of you die it gives the trustee me that\nThat that the direction on how to handle the assets and disperse them to take care of this child's needs\nUm and what that needs to be is a a big hairy term life insurance policy that ... that is the beneficiary of it is that special needs trust or a portion of the policy you know thirty percent or twenty percent of the policy in the beneficiary line goes to the special needs trust\nIn the event that both of you die kind of a thing where the primary beneficiary is your wife okay but then past that the secondary beneficiary is\nSome portion would go while you've got minor children into a family trust to take care of the minor children your oldest two until they get them through college the other portion would go into the special needs trust to perpetually care for this other child throughout life not\nJust through college and so it's a larger amount needed to do that and then what happens is let's say we fast forward Twenty years\nAnd this child is Twenty years old and you've got a million and a half dollars and mutual funds okay your other children are grown and gone or close Twenty years from now right that the dream yeah it's a dream that law yeah we're kicking them out so they're going [laughter]\nThat's the legacy baby [laughter] but it's out of that then then what we've got is we've got you know some portion of my million and a half dollars in my example is gonna be parked in the special needs trust in the event both you and your wife or to pass the rest of it would go to your ... more traditional airs directly\nTo her but you know we put a million dollars in a in the the youngest child special needs trust at Twenty years old because he's going to need care and that's eighty thousand dollars a year it'll producing it that'll take care of him and maybe one of his brothers is the trustee by\nYou know would you would you build it had like we're doing right now would you formula trust as illegal activity no now and we've been unfunded or would not let it will pay for it make it a clause in in the well I Know I Would I Would\nMake it a clause in the will to be formed upon both of your\nDeaths okay because you don't need it now you don't need to be filing tax returns for the next twenty five years on this thing you don't need to ... earn more than all the time you don't need to go all the legal expense to form the trust so let me give you another example okay the special needs for us as a as a special\nConditional version of just taking care of minor children right then the differences that might be perpetual okay\nBut you know my children grew up\nAnd moved out on her own their own so my need for a trust to cover my minor children in\nA in a the event of both of our best expires\nAt I formed across from my minor children at that time in the needs that expire\nAt I formed across from my minor children at that time in the least satisfied\nAnd I would have done it for nothing in this case is not going to be ... you're going to need a trust\nBut I wouldn't be doing it until you die that's when\nIt on the on death in the ... that's what I Would do whatever you want and that's that's how we do\nI get asked all the time about what people need to do to improve their families money situation to the most overlooked things are term life insurance and\nDisability insurance both plans make sure that you have income to pay bills\nAnd take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen preterm life you need to carry tend to twelve times your income and I recommend Fifteen or twenty year plans for most families stay away from cash value or return a premium plans there just a rip off\nDisability insurance was just as critical how are you going to pay your bills or if you're unable to work disability is the leading cause of bankruptcies in foreclosures\nThat's why I send you those and their

I. fans time and twenty thousand dollars in cash and I just started um Iraq IRA I'm right now I only have about five thousand dollars and you will not\nThink here by how I just sat within the past couple of months here I'm listening to you I'm credit and such that me and the one thing that I haven't prioritized is actually on paying off my student loans [laughter]\nUm so and I think you and find your babysat I um I decided to go ahead and take back twenty thousand dollars um wire Eighteen thousand dollars of it and pay ...\nUm [noise] so right now I have about Eighteen thousand dollars less and get up on 'em which I'm trying to actively attack\nI'm the one thing though is that um\nOh and then I also stopped I I was putting in twelve percent of my income into my ... and I had that in half and for her than\nI'm the one thing though is that I've started talking to my friends about what I'm feeling\nAnd they are just they're like are you crazy you're a single woman well how could you only have two thousand dollars in the wire you you know trying to attack your student loans are only federal loans that they're not proud of that\nI've even heard some of my friends say that you know and force comes to worst you can move out of the country and not pay your debt or are\nAre your friends multi millionaires\n\nFor joining us America our question today comes from blinds dot com you do not need a second mortgage to make your own mother you get ... Lucas some blondes without paying customer prizes that blinds dot com free samples free shipping and new promos every month if you use the promo code\nRamsey blondes dot com Jacob is in Washington and do you recommend putting Fifteen Percent into retirement I work for the local fire department and I have a pension plan do I need to say Fifteen Percent\nOver and above that count that as part of it what\nWhat I tell folks is you need to put Fifteen Percent and most of the time and a pension plan you're not putting in anything\nAnd\nYou don't have any control over what happens with a pension plan you don't choose the investments you don't get to um you know if the ... municipality in your case as poorly run they could break the pension plan\nIt's happened before doesn't happen very much but um no I think\nYou need to be putting Fifteen Percent of your income away in\n... four one K. is whatever you got to do along those lines\nAnd and that's the thing I Would tell you that the reason is is that what you've got that money you choose word invest it and if somebody mishandled something at work it doesn't mess up your four one K. doesn't mess up your Roth IRA you are controlling your destiny are not waiting on someone else\nThe people you work for it affects your life\nThat's a big deal Johns in Pittsburgh hey John welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHow are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm good I'm reason I'm calling is here's my question uh my wife is sixty five but I'm sixty two were just now into getting on the on the snowball we have a ... ... ...\n... but we're looking for a new place to live the house was rent right now is just way too big for my wife and I got bad knees bad backs mhm up and down the stairs opinion about all the time okay um my question is\nUm rentals around this area now are skyrocketing because there's new cracker plant going in so people are coming in from out of state sucking all those up mhm [noise]\nBut I found a couple of houses that I could purchase\nAnd the pay my rent right now is eight Seventy five a month or my payment would drop to about six hundred and thirty dollars come up mhm [noise]\nUm the other part of it is a when I retired from the post office I rolled mine are prescribing ... into an IRA and good but I can borrow enough for him right now we're now I only just be able to put towards ... percent down ... on the house so I wouldn't\nGood that I can borrow enough for him right now we're already just be able to put towards ... percent down ... on the house so I wouldn't have to pay the ... ...\nBut you know in your face the American idol with them twenty percent\nYou're you're you're not turning your two broke to buy a house you're in debt okay you're in debt you get your borrowing against your retirement I mean you're straining every corner to pull this off okay um and besides that you if you're moving from an eight Seventy five rental to six hundred dollar payment you're moving down in the house substantially\nSo we're going to move down and how substantially moved down to a different rental and let me tell you if the rental market is squeezed because of a plant that has come in the buying market is squeezed as well\nSo what you're telling me is not logical you're using this as a rationalization to buy out of order I if I were you when you call me and I ask what you should do it I Would rent something else move out of that rental moved to a cheaper rental that'd be fine\nAh for a short period of time that while you clean up your debt your debt free you build your emergency phoned up three to six months of expenses then you have a good down payment and you can do all of that in a few years if you're careful and watch what you're doing and then make your purchased\nBut when you buy a house and you're broke you're asking for trouble I mean a Murphy will move in your spare bedroom bringing his three cousins broke desperate and stupid owning a home when you're broke and be a financial curse\nRather than a blessing\nSteven as in Virginia Beach Hi Stephen how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI just wanted to know what would be a martyr to deal with right now I have a higher and my name and I know you can only put five thousand five hundred into a year yesterday hypothetically\nAt me and my wife only had ... mouth that amount of money five thousand five hundred to go toward the exact thing\nWhether it be smarter to put all of it into my rock IRA is or should I open up the road from my in my wife's name and then flip the five thousand five hundred and put two thousand seven hundred and fifty in each of them and watch her grow that way\nWhat's your household income household income is fifty thousand okay Mm\nSo Fifteen Percent of that going in baby steps for into retirement is more like\nA ten thousand no it would be more like Seventy five hundred okay um [noise]\nOkay so you wouldn't fully fund to but you could put some it it doesn't matter uh which one you do mathematically let's say you chose the exact same mutual fund\nAnd you put three thousand in more than three thousand and another okay one and not one Roth IRA and your name one Roth IRA and her name or are you put six thousand in the same mutual fund it's going to grow exactly the same so it doesn't matter\nUh he'll I even have like a thousand dollars I can I could open up one have five hundred in my name and five hundred her but you have the exact\nExactly it doesn't it doesn't have you any mathematical advantage whatsoever the only advantage is just a relational\nIn that if she feels like that you know you're fully funding yours and she's not got anything for retirement which is not true because if you ever got divorced or died or anything else she's gonna get half that money even if it is and your name\nOkay okay so it's not true but sometimes people just you know like she just wants some and her name that's okay so you can do half and half if you want you need to get to the point you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement that's baby step for\nAnd that would be after you were out of debt and after you had your emergency fund them ... which may be why\nYou don't have the money right now\nThat's why we put baby step for after getting out of that and after having emergency if I tell folks temporarily not to save for retirement until you clear your debts that way you have the money to put Fifteen Percent away\nAnd a Fifteen Percent is more than one Roth IRA for you guys but conceptually if you just even if you did Seventy five hundred thirty seven or fifty bucks each\nAh that'd be fine or if you did fifty five hundred and two thousand and the other name that's fine if they're in the same mutual fund you're going to get the exact same results whether you split it or not doesn't change a thing James is with us in\nFort Smith Arkansas Hi James how are you\nGood thank you for taking my call sure what's up my wife and I are planning to fire hall next year and have a little trouble deciding or or agreeing on the house would not want to get a outline and towards getting a fixer upper\nThere'll be a cheaper house with lower mortgage payment mhm and that gave me the opportunity to learn learn how to do those holler Harris myself mhm and she wants to get moving ready house\nMhm okay and it'd be your first home\nThey are second all we've had a house for a while ago and then we moved in rent printing well over a\nYear now you know the other home that you had was at a fixer upper it was not able to live and ready okay and um so what is her fear\nIt's just more of we have to cook it you know and it kind of a hassle amounted to house mhm I didn't want anything major just you know just some minor cosmetic type stuff\nBut I couldn't you do it for you moved in\nA financial aid I'll think we'd be able to pay for rent and a mortgage\nNo I'm saying oh yeah okay I see what you're saying that you use a fixer upper would take a few months may be and you wouldn't have time to do I got you\nI'm a part time real estate agent so if I live in a house for two years and then turn around and sell it\nI can tell it tax free\nShowed anyway about I'm like oh you can show tax free anyway you know to be a real estate I saw how sex very personal residents will be limited to your facts for growth on that anyway for anybody [noise]\nI don't think there's a I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to this is just a question of what you guys want to endure it is your home we are homeless topsy turvy because it's being renovated all the time and yet we have some valid point on her you're not going to make as much money on it to your point so it's a valid argument [noise]\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches are being recorded every\nAh probably ... or we would go to my wife is she still living would would continue to receive a lesser amount that's probably because I can take I can take it as no survivor and probably get more\nYeah but are you healthy yes\nI Would take it as no survivor give more by Fifteen year level term insurance\nTo cover your wife have something happen to be here it's a better deal going to take all the money or you can get you know\nOkay I currently have a four hundred thousand dollar term policy show\nOkay yeah then that she's probably All right without the survivor benefit because that's going to replace your forty thousand dollars that you wouldn't have the she wouldn't have if your dad okay that that that are invested on ... percent will be forty grand so that that's pretty good you're\nIn good shape\nAnd you can probably do it this way um I Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\nYou're you're in a way above average shape I'm In good shape is is is way above normal 'cause normal just sucks okay you got it way better than most people but I'm living on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life for the next forty years is going to get old\nAnd you don't really have any income coming other than that because your investments aren't big enough to create it and so I Would you know how you can do it you can do it but I think you need to have in the back of your head you may be going back to work at some point\nI'm considered that I thought about it for the health insurance and um [noise] um and I've heard of these mega share programs do you\nRemember when I was not driving this for me for what's driving it for me is you don't have much money\nRight and you got the pension but I understand you know think about what what are\nYou know forty thousand dollars is going to buy in forty years when you are Ninety\nNothing yeah nothing\nThat's the problem with a guy out here so it doesn't have a good long term prognosis of you guys just being able to live and we can figure out how you could live in other words if you had a million dollars a mutual fund this becomes like a no brainer\nInstead you're not like a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand maybe even a scrape everything together EPA's failed around properties and you know the farms got value but it's not producing any money so what might what I'm thinking is an ... and again you can do whatever you want to I'm just talking it through with the okay\nI'm not saying you're you're you're you're wrong or you're bad or something but that's my concern of what I'm hearing is and so I probably would think about what we always called an encore career and say what could you do that would be really fun\nThat you could make fifty grand or a hundred grand doing for the next five or six seven years\nAnd you enjoy doing it start a business you'd have fun doing it and make some bank and bank all of it and health insurance as part of the deal I don't care if you're working for somebody else you start a business but just to show them what you're doing out and make you smile anymore so you need to get out of there\n[laughter] you picked up on that her yeah and so you know but I but I mean when you're you're young you have a lot of uh a lot of\nService to humanity left inside of you that you could get paid for ideas concepts things you could do I don't know what it is but it's something that just I mean I I'm just a little bit older than you I'm fifty seven and do not plan on work\nAnd it's not 'cause I Need money I don't make any money I got money coming in layers but I'm working because I have a blast gotta find something like that\nAnd then you can work in hunt and fish and worked in hunt and fish and farm and you know but but\nYou know I'd like to see your bank another five or six hundred grand and the next eight years and have fun doing it that's what I'm saying that's a that's the only challenge I've got is I think there's God's got something inside of you there is something you can do more than hunting and fishing that\nNot the best people are bad it's not you've earned the right to do that and you should get out of the place you're getting outta but what's your encore career you take a bow and you come back out on the stage for the encore that's what the encore career as a lot of people in like a lot of money on that Richard\nSo and and it's not that money's everything but I I just want you to have a little more pad between you and Murphy then this scenario gives me here\nAnd I think there's some magic left inside of you that we all need still that's what I'm saying\nAnd it might be you take a year and you do nothing behind fishing for him and then usually at the end of that year I'm going to go do X and that's okay but but Ninety for for the next forty years you're going to get tired of fishing [laughter]\nYou know bottom fishing [laughter] so find something makes you smile when you do that's all I'm saying so uh I'm gonna send you a copy of a book that I think you'll enjoy\nCalled start to starting a fresh chapter I don't think you'll enjoy this thank you for calling in to talk\nTo your show [laughter] this is that Iran to show\n[noise]\n\n\n[laughter]\nA common theme around

actually uses the capture code is a kind of we gee board\nWhere show right down with the word is and instead of entering it in show refreshed the page to get a new word and she'll keep refreshing\nTo hear over and over again until all the words render into some sentence\nWhy do they do the caption just to make sure you're a real person\nExactly so they know you're not a hot as it were\nWell and then it happens with technology you know I'm I'm also fascinated I don't know if you looked at ... electronic voice phenomena\nWhere the whole chapter in a book about ... percent perfect\nBecause it seems to me that since we've gone to the digital age from the analog age they're getting more and more these recordings\nYes indeed and I think that what you have is you have the ability now to\nUse digital radio to stand the frequencies more quickly\nA fellow by the name of Frank ... in the nineties figured out that if you hack a digital FM radio you can literally break it in such a way so that is that scans the frequency is it doesn't stop at a station when the signal comes and clear it just continually sweeps\nAnd they can that that's that continuous sweeping has ... ... if you do that voices and other sounds sort of a rise out of that noise\nAnd again people will write these words down that they will\nCapturing these very quick sparse moments as its scans the frequencies and see if they can have some or attempt to have some kind of communication with with a imagine as the spirit world\nHe came up with one of his cold springs box which is trying to do exactly that isn't it that's\nRight Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful very creative um devices that he made and he they became more and more complex so eventually he started to think that maybe in fact it wasn't spirits at all but that it was he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nPeter as you were putting together strange frequencies did you come across anything strange yourself\nWell I did some experiments and there were a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly odd but I think what was important was that I was able to sort of get into that heads space where I felt that I was doing something that had been\nBeing done for centuries I mean I'm I'm would like to make the argument that even somebody like John de who was using his scene stones to try to communicate with the angels and ... and as a result created what magicians call the ... language\nThat that used to have a scene stone is the same as using radio to communicate with the spirit world that if this is something that human beings have been attempting to deal with some media mystic the vice some material device\nWhere we take some pain and we read purpose that we use it in a way that it wasn't originally intended and in fact the magician or the medium becomes a kind of spiritual hacker where we're really trying to interact with our technologies and\nMagician or the medium becomes a kind of spiritual hacker where we're really tried to interact with our technologies and our material world in a way that some would say really is that what we're supposed to be going with it and yet as we know what's really the hackers\nThat have work early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers we probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our home [laughter]\nThat's true Peter ... with us his latest book is called strange frequencies you start the book with Jewish mythology and legend surrounding the Golan tell us about that\n[noise] yeah I mean I like to think that the goal of them is really the first piece of technology right where we try to build something and in ... with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend of the goal them as it's called particularly the goal of Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds\nA goal and to help the Jewish people who feel um we're being attacked or there's a poll rum and they're trying to defend themselves\nAnd eventually the goal and become as\nIt goes you know it it it it it\nThere's chaos as soon as the rabbi can no longer control it and either has to destroy it already has to put it to sleep\nIt one of the stories that goal and gross so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder and a race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbles into dot sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories but if you look at the actual\nJewish ... missed this as a mystical writings about the call them the goal of them is in some ways a a means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their spiritual\n... it's it's almost like a pass to show that they are prepared for greater mystical magical knowledge\nBut the goal and self ... was understood by the rabbis to be just kind of a dumb machine\nHere's a wonderful tell my story where a rabbi ... go to the head rabbi and they show him the goal and the he says to them well what can I Do kind of speak and they say well no it can't speak and he says well then what good is it it's just a\nIt's just the toy [laughter]\nWhich is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures right right so\nWe can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that then we're just pretended to the throne as it were\nHere what about the Sherman says well you know in native ah American tradition and other types of was a direct cultures the showman also seemed to be the person connected to the other side\n[noise] that's right and the Sherman would also use utilize sound and\nLight off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to introduce the states have consciousness in their people and I think that what the ... and what the stage magician does in many ways this is very connected and it also\nCan access it connects the technology to the history of spiritualism and the staging of spiritualism which spirit cabinets and the different ways in which people were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet\nBut they were using technologies to be able to create the state\nOf consciousness in the audience and so I don't think that it's necessarily well we we don't go to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to be in chat we want to invest in that state of mind\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advanced I think there's something that we have long\nBeen excited about it I mean even watching a film about spirits in the movie theater is almost like a ... sure experience isn't it\nThomas Edison the great inventor was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build his own machine I don't think he was ever able to do it was you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have\nVery interesting thing here where we have people who are considered scientists to rationalize and it's not that they were the monkey and because they want it to just be cynical skeptical because they really want that there to be the truth this is true of Houdini\nHoudini really want it to him he really wanted to find a medium who could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his ear departed mother but he couldn't find on all he found where Charlotte but his but he believed that it could be possible\nAnd I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where\nLet's just for a moment pretend even if it's just the pretend moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves and ...\nThose are new Houdini by the way you do write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking tone up your right yes that's right ... going to be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy but as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job\nThat's right if he had today's equipment do you think he might be able to do something\n[laughter] maybe but I think that he would also find which unfortunately I sometimes found is that people were using these things but if you set of\nUh you move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraption think is most quickly try to hide the fact that maybe he really was it is magical as you thought\nWere going to be back in a moment to talk more with Peter a beeper goal his book strange frequencies we've got a link to his publisher Random House to make it easy for you to get the book you if you're into this in some magnificent story the subtitle is the extraordinary story of the technological quest\nTo the super natural stick with us we're going to take calls with Peter next hour well even take your stories you're proven almost stories and just your general questions more to talk with him about though about strange frequencies high technology in its ability to maybe communicate with the other side\nPeter of all these incredible inventors and engineers and sea cruise were jumping attempting to get some kind of evidence about the existence of the other side what do you think drove them why would they so obsessed with trying to get these answers I\nThink what Dr fat quest is what drives a very human quest to take control of our own spiritual\nMaterial ... I mean if it I think it's actually a very American Spirit right I mean\nThat some scholars a sociologist one in particular max vapor used to talk about you know Protestantism in the spirit of capitalism that something about the Protestant American Spirit is something whereby we want to\nProve our righteousness we want to prove that we are loved by God by by being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right and\nI think that that extends even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we are in charge of our own salvation where we want to be right\nIn front of our experience with the divine\nIs is again something that's very human I think particularly American off and and so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say\nYou know what I'm gonna do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with spirit or with God or divine or whatever\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something that pre existing eye opening it up and re purpose in it and so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people have practice magic for millennium right\nJust another example of magic of a of a cult practice where we are trying\nTo insert ourselves between right right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to have this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool like\nCould we put you Peter in that category\nMyself yeah wow I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that um I tend to ah believe though that\nWe have to be careful about how much we try to rest that you know from it we have to post put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer them maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\nYeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it I mean it is\nYou know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this or why some people are like this goes you know back to the whole idea that we once used to think that a that a profit was somebody who had special information for us\nAnd now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so you know it's a for a long time we've been wrestling with a visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce are that we called visionary art or spiritual art are often considered outsider artists why is that why are the people who are working\nWith these teams considered to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular are you know mainstream artistic community and I think it's we live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience\nAnd what's interesting about technology is that it and this is really key here to see if I can explain this\nSomebody takes her radio\nAnd they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio and I'm going to resign or a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world but the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to east Saudi Arabia and have another effect take place\nThe science behind that that even made this radio or something that you could find the store with said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't it yet\nAnd yet we can take the things this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that is underneath the scientific method and scientific understanding of the world it's\nIt's underneath it and divorced and turned it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can think about technologies in ways that if the science connected to that might actually be in opposition to\nWell if you didn't own a radio or have a computer where you could listen online and somebody came up to you and said Peter I hear voices of this guy at night\nTalking about ghosts and spirit snow these strange things he's helped their he's out there and you of course who never had a radio you've never went on line like that to listen you're probably seeing what's this guy talking about he's insane or but my voices out there and it's being heard by millions\nOr if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all\nWe need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to is the right time to receiver\nWell it's fascinating that you say that because when spiritual is a was becoming\nYou too is the right time to receiver\nWell it's fascinating that you say that because when spiritual is a was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started developed ... telegraph technology\nAnd people called medium spiritual mediums spiritual telegraph [laughter] they really believe that there was this link between this\nNew version and technology and how you're right it was a special and new kind of receiver and transmit her and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iraq his really augmented in shape things were spirituality in technology tell me why\nWell I mean that TV itself has kind of a ... very strange and scary yeah\nIf the some of the the there's a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four called the clue television company and they actually they this is how they advertised on TV this is what they said the dreams of witches have come true all my God\nSo they they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird but to increase\nIts sense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether right [noise]\nUm and so the the fact that you know week that we used to call those the after effects on a TV you know in the when we were used to watch you ate Jeff in VHS stations with an antenna we used to call those ghosts right so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically\nIs is filled to the brim right with these supernatural on a cult metaphors and I think that that's really important I think even when we talk about technology even if we're not believers and even if we're just using it we still use these this language to try to make sense of it\nAnd I remember those days to not that this has anything to do with our discussion tonight but a ... radios televisions were built into very heavy furniture remember those\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely yep\nMy dad had an old silk go radio and this thing must have been about four feet tall\nAnd you know where was it was in case in this beautiful piece of wouldn't for mature and had silicone written across it uh you know it was it was a piece of art in the same we have TVs in the in the stereos others started coming out with\nThe Chinese are meant to be central pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like pulp guys comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nAre you a hundred percent convinced Peter that the other side exists\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I you know I live in a very limited all place what I what I like more than anything and what I liked about is about technology is that I really believe that these ambiguous\nStates are in chanting states it when somebody tries to convince me something is a hundred percent true\nI tend to be a lot more skeptical than somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nGet into your time machine and tell me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regards to trying to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well let's talk more about um\nDoes it stop tax ... or a message ... by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration project yellow light noise and the ad

the time but just the fact that correlation of Houdini Detroit and I just want to say that I Believe\nThat's that's a that's a great story rich thanks for that Houdini was in the Detroit River when he was in town before he died was he not\nProfessor yeah I think I think that was one of his one of his uh scrapes\nYeah you really want they dumped the ... river I think he was in a straight jacket upside down\nYeah he love doing that and sometimes he was in a box Houdini would uh he would uh modify his escapes to whatever uh you know kind of businesses that wanted to support them so ah you know if the police supported him he to skate from\nOne of their jail cells or a there was one tiny escape from a like big fish they built a big fish 'cause there was a fish company that was sponsoring him in their town so he would uh he would it\nKind of ingenuity fleas he would make up some way to escape from something that tied in to his advertisers\nTony Curtis died in a twenty two and he was eighty five years old but I thought he did a great job in that movie you remember it\nYes yeah I think all of the movies have been actually pretty good yeah ah I don't they don't stick with the actual\nHow did how did he make that Allison disappear in the ... in London how did he do that\nWell can you want me to tell yeah\nYeah you know the truth [laughter] I mean what did he how did they have the thing covered or or what first of all\n[noise] ah no I Can't tell I'm not gonna tell 'em\nCome on smile I\nMight tell you in private there's a book you can buy a ... by a guy who who\nHill and let me ask you this if I'm right would you tell me yes\nAnd if I if you are right oh I'll tell you do have to tell you on air\nYeah well me I'm just going to ask you if you question okay that's did he have any apparatus that raises the elephant from underground you know\nYou did not okay I'm going to assume that the elephant was always there yes well okay we'll do a little more homework yeah yeah they do know what\nComes up with the tricks I mean was this Houdini does that make him a genius for being able to come up with this or did he have somebody on staff like you who would say here's this trick\nAnd let's do this and we can make this map how did they do this easy same Wisconsin ... feel too I assume ... people on staff like you right\nExactly exactly I'm\nJames Collins when the guy that Houdini the built all inform but Houdini would say I want to do this and then he would put it in the ball and\nWhen the guy that Houdini the bill to all of them for them but Houdini would say I want to do this and then he would put it in the ball in their court and then they would have to come up with how you would\nDo so I assume in the human genome they walk in Alison out everybody sees this thing lumbering ... and then they're shrouded in or close to ... or something and then the trick began it's absolutely amazing wasn't the queen there at the time\n[noise] uh well he\nProbably the same ...\n[laughter] you know in Europe but I don't think she was at their okay I I don't know for sure\nNext on it I don't think she was there I think he performed for them in Europe\nOh let's go to the first time caller Ralph in Indianapolis I'm Ralph go ahead\nYes I'm here already taken away things\nUh I knew are here for a while and it was last five years of his life\nGot a letter from him just before he died ... odd seeing bishop pike on a ledge when he was trying to go over to comb Ron in Israel and that's where they found them question for you or what what year did Arthur forward bring back the code to Mrs Houdini\nThis was in Nineteen twenty nine okay with a three part code or the code was the middle section first word was Rosa meller rows and then he had a code for the nine or words that spelled out believe\nAnd then she had Dr words in French which means I pulled the curtain back like this and that's what she told him so he was a shirt that his code I'd gotten through\nNot didn't he she later denied that later on a after she loses her friends she loses all her money a man a called Edward fate comes into her life and says he's her manager but they live together\nHe fell in love again yeah so he didn't like that that's why you wanted to come back\nRight she meet women the same kind of way that doesn't mean there's a lot of things going on here but he's like Twenty years younger than her\nPromise to her that she can make a movie and she'll make a million dollars okay go ahead\n[noise] uh what year than they cheat deny that the code was correct well the first time she never denies the code was correct or she says she was\nShe never denies that the code was correct but she first about a year and a half after um she they're given the Houdini messages\nShe having lunch with some ladies in Miami and she's she said she was hesitant about a\nHoudini coming back because why didn't he favor from the depression so she was she thought that Houdini would somehow favor from this math\nAnd oppression that what's happening or that somehow he was going to come back and not breakfast with her every morning or something I don't know what she was thinking but she wasn't happy about the fact that\nUh Arthur Ford was on tour somewhere so she had no way to contact him and so she was you know showing this pleasure for that than Edward St comes in later promises or a million dollars and then they go on and about eight years later\nThey make a movie called a a religious racket chairs\nYeah he made a ... a a couple of movies at least Disney\nWell Houdini made four or five movies\nYeah but they also I Hope they do they do well\nOr they get fine but he was he was the star of of every movie\nWas like an actor or were they more like documentaries\nThey he was an actor and he always had like a really really good looking coast are\nHis real name Eric Weiss yes he was he was a pretty good looking guy too I\nKind of a sudden muffin guy he was only in everything kind of a smooth smooth talker could really give a a ... compliments really well but he wasn't the greatest actor but he used it to promote his escape so we had a bunch of escapes and have all the movies\nReal name Eric white some\n... gifts and knocks Eric turned into Harry and then who dating he got from who Don and he added and I called in Houdini and er so to this day they call them Harry Houdini but I don't think he ever\nSwitch his name and he was born in Europe and he wasn't born here and he was\nHe was born in Hungary\nYeah he was born in Hungary Budapest and he wasn't even actually a U.S citizen if you're thinking that\nWasn't there but you shouldn't even Blackstone did he come after hearing\nA blacks almost after here yeah\nOkay 'cause he was pretty good too was and he\nHe was great he was great or there was him and his son also there was a junior\nHas has a techno who's who's the artist who are David Blaine is humid you shouldn't do\n[noise] well he's a very good magician he is a missed the fire a Houdini began calling himself a missed the fire uh he kind of drop the magician thing okay and so people are starting to go that way it's part of the mystery our you know\nWhen people go see a magician do they want the trick to fail or succeed what do you say\nWell I think they all want it to succeed I think you'd be a strange individual if you'd like to see the guy fall on his face\nNot some people who want to see that\nYeah maybe maybe uh I don't ah\nI see I Want I Want to see the the trick professor and then trying to figure out what happened how we did it\nRight that's me when I when I first went to Disney Land when I was a kid I went through the hunted mansion 'cause I I had to know I went through their eleven times because I had to know figure out how they did all those illusions\nAre their female educations\n[noise] ah yeah Dorsey Dietrich this is a matter of fact Dorothy Dietrich or will be doing a Houdini Sam tomorrow where a in I think she's in Pennsylvania\nThat would be yes did they get media coverage these days\nAre Scranton, Pennsylvania and the ... museum now I'll tell you one thing about David Copperfield you're asking about David David has one of the best Houdini collections in the world\nWhile there's a great one to the magic castle in Hollywood, California as well but stay with us professor we're gonna come back in\nJust a second or two and take a call ...\nWe've got a great feeling story sort of or in the house one of\nThose botanical that is so absolutely so amazing David your guy that has overcome severe issue\nOr whether light the light bulb went on and I started to research down down and say ... yeah it's a wonderful thing that is bringing me back and it's almost eight years now\nHow did you did you take the liquid did you take the cat\nI was going through capsules like or I couldn't get enough it made me feel so much better\nSoon after you began taking the

James Madison is\nIs looking at something different he's not looking at whether you came from Great Britain or not correct he's not talking about people who are coming in trying to drop off to like be able to take stuff or or you know or bring the whole family in born in the colonies or were you born in Great Britain correct and they answered that two ways\nIf you were born here you don't need naturalization however\nYou also have to be born here to be president and that's what they were worried about they were worried about these English coming in ... ... try this out for size they were worried about the English coming in\nAnd just saying hey I'm I'm I'm American I'm living here and I'm American\nSo I can vote because they knew that if all these English people came in they would change the country that's why they didn't want an a a a foreigner as president as well you had to be born here so they were trying to protect it at that time\nFrom the English coming in and screwing up the country with a vote which is what we're\nStill dealing with now\nI think I agree with that although he's saying if you were born here you are\nYou do have correct because it was a ... it was a different time and a different problem yeah and I say like as much as I Love games that and I love the founders I ... it's almost less important what they thought about this particular issue because it was an amendment to the constitution right we are talking about the fourteenth amendment yeah they do\nAnd that's why you have to separate James Madison 'cause that's not constitutional he didn't put that in the constitution was that was put in under Lincoln and and so now go to that because that's a different argument as well\nUm so so this is now a Edward Bates is president Lincoln's attorney general ... so we're in a pretty this is again a few years right before they do the fourteenth amendment\nOr the eight incorporate the language and is a this is a from the articles of National Review properly understood of codified ... attorney general based contemporary understanding this is what he says\nI'm quite clear in the opinion that children born in the United states of alien parents who have never been naturalized are native born citizen of the United states and of course do not require the formality of naturalization to entitled them to the rights and privileges of such citizenship isn't there more\nThat is the end of that quote I thought there was something else too about or maybe it was in James\nMadison that they had come in the proper way or something I I thought I heard that earlier today but the the the\nAbraham Lincoln thing is just the same remember so way on a constitutional thing because there wasn't the fourteenth amendment yet I Know I Know he's writing it this is this is the beginning of it so the first one is\nHow do we know who is citizen is because it's almost all well it is at that point all immigrants except those who had come over and the Mayflower a or had their relatives come over before and so it's very small number it was mainly immigrants\nSo how do you know who is an American well were you born here\nThat was it that was the question of who's an American at that time because it was mainly\nA you know people from England and they were worried about the English coming in so you're born here you're a citizen you can serve you can vote starting to get a pretty serious German influx too yes serious German and they were freaked by that the the second thing is uh with with\nLincoln he's trying to solve it different problem he's trying to solve at that point the Democrat literally the Democratic party this is their first attempt before poll taxes\nAnd you know moving the polling place and all of the crap that they did the first thing was oh well you know you're not okay you might be you might be a citizen but\nYour kids to your kids weren't slaves so your kids aren't citizens he's they're trying to say stop it stop it\nWe're talking about the slaves slaves are free their citizens and so are there children that you have to look at the thirteenth fourteenth amendment for what it was talking about and what it was trying to do it was trying to say to the Democrats\nStop it these are human\nDo it was trying to say to the Democrats stop it\nThese are human beings and they are citizens that'd be fascinated here and these two sides topics out because they're both coming from the conservative perspective it's not like you know Chris Cuomo versus somebody you trust or at least they're both sides of the argument I think a really interesting I don't\nBecause I think you're right the but sometimes that is because that is definitely what they were intending right was slavery however sometimes you ... that is the also there's they're on an unintended but intended consequences where you would you would absorb a larger group to make sure one group is is there is no way the intent\nIs that if you come here from Mexico central and South America and you have a baby and everybody who does that is now is that it's there there's a way that there are\nRussian tours now that take you Chinese students take you to Miami the Russian noodle Miami you stay here for a few weeks you have the baby here your your your child as American citizenship same thing in Hawaii with the Asians\nAre it big in Hawaii but probably also big in California that's not what they were talking about\nThis out at all different problem yeah the the constitution the first ten in the bill of rights those are universal those are gigantic so when somebody says bill of rights well is it in the first ten\nBecause the first ten our global\nPretty much with the exception of new ideas\nAre pretty much the the the rest of them are a reef stating of the first one where they had to get very specific and say no dummy women women are part of all men are created equal women can vote same thing with blacks\nIn the thirteenth fourteenth amendment\nMhm it there there were specific where the\nWhere the amendments are very ... the first ten\nWhat is it made sense for them to think that in Dallas texas United States of America at Parkland Hospital Seventy five percent of the babies born there are born to illegals and now they're all citizens you know that doesn't make sense to anybody\nDoesn't I definitely don't think it'd be good at your right not a good idea constitution ... this this this is the\nBest phrase and I just I Can't understand how people don't understand that the constitution was not meant to be a suicide pact\nThat's positive or not but that's also a very dangerous free so I guess I feel like that's the same argument people use with the second amendment\nOh well they would they look I mean that the time they only had these little weapons that were not at all\nSure they wanted freedom of guns I mean these guys are too big into the brutal and this is not meant to be a suicide power when I'm Talking about suicide pack I mean on the principles\nOn the principles it's not meant to be a suicide pack if we follow these principles you won't have a constitution you won't have America anymore you just won't because what he is doing it for a hundred\nYears and we still have America are not doing it differently now there was not the have the baby tourism back in Nineteen hundred it certainly being exploited at some level right I mean but that does not mean huge than them like let's just say we ... ally argument is an argument to amend the constitution\nRight yeah let's just say if it was their intent was at the beginning let's just say it was\nThat we wanted it but what aliens to just come in and have been dropped babies over here and then they're going to be anchor babies and they're going to get citizenship would just say that with their intent I don't think it was but let's just say it was if\nThat was true and and back then people weren't exploding and now people are you telling member shot that you should not the U.S said we\nNow think problem if you want to change guns don't make some slippery arguments just amended Eighteenth amendment twenty First Amendment and we said you know what we're going to ban all alcohol\nWe did it bad idea twenty First Amendment forget the Eighteenth amendment we need a drink [laughter]\n[laughter] right yeah and that's the way you're supposed to do it yeah and they don't want to do it that way because it's hard it's hard and they know that it's impossible to make the argument because when you do something that big you actually have to think about it\nAnd you know out of hand magic is doing our\nPower to an angry left wing mob and\nCalm I don't get much worse I'm Wendy Rogers Republican for Congress running against tunnel

[laughter] two dollars and you got nothing so we have donated to dollars to the lottery fund ooh that's gone\nAnd I still got to figure out where that money goes I've had listeners Jerry request I got to get the director whoever of the Arizona Lottery to just forgot the pie because there's a pie on line that shows the money goes here here here and here but where's that money really it's a big\n... big racket I mean it's billions and billions of dollars a nationally or in that state run legalized gambling they the the gangs in Iraq it's\nA long time figured out the numbers\nGame which was the lottery and neighborhood lottery of City Missouri\nAnd they made tons of money off of it the legal but yeah it definitely legal or folks would want to hear from you eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one um let's get back to this mark burn a bitch attorney general mark burn a bridge interview if you missed it he talked about suing he's personally suing\nTom ... for libel I guess right for saying you're and so he's a hard case very hard case but he's also as the attorney general\nSuing the Arizona board of regents over what he calls a unconstitutional tuition rate increases because the constitution in Arizona requires\nCollege education at our state three state colleges to be as free as possible\nFree as possible and it says contention that the board of regents is is not doing that\nAnd one of the one of the aspects of that we've talked about this is that the the innate you and the university where most familiar with spends millions of dollars acquiring additional land and and buildings around this perimeter\nAnd so\nYou know the question comes up with what effect does that have on the tuition and could you lower tuition if you weren't buying all of these buildings\nAnd the university is quick to say well that's a different part of money ... ... that's not tuition that's other money well still tax money and and I am sure that the attorney general part of his argument would be\nMaybe you don't need all of the facilities that you are spending money on\nAnd you could use that to lower tuition I think that's what he's saying so what he mentioned in my ears perked up during that interview and if you missed it or what the attorney general said was they're using these foundations are the three ... Arizona universities they use foundations to purchase things\nUh like land and buildings and stuff and he says it say transparency issue because you don't have the same transparency requirements with the hum of the foundations\nAnd I thought right away I said well me and Jerry talked about this uh uh maybe six weeks ago two months ago and we talked about in Flagstaff northern Arizona university a there was a foundation or some group that was purchasing and then any you is going to buy it through a long term loan\nA big chunk of land seven I Believe it's seven point nine million dollars for an old building on a very busy street Milton avenue only to knock it down and that's how they did it so my ear I was like wow he's he's he's right on here and they they did the same thing with the old grand niece closet restaurant\nTry to influence elections in Montana or Illinois\nI ... I don't know of any and similarly the minimum wage increase group\nOr whatever they're called ... they the ones that are urging people to vote no on for a teen\nThey're primarily funded way over half of all their funding came from a group in New York City and the rest of the major funding came from a union Mac mhm so\n... why do all these outside influences try to influence Arizona and then in more more particularly Flagstaff what who yeah I don't they take care of their own state\nAnd the Flagstaff connection is interesting and I wasn't going to mention that there is I have to email this I'm Norwegian film crew back I Am who wants to come in and film the show friday um regarding for Eighteen\nI haven't done it yet I I guess I don't know if this is of interest in Norway I guess they want to it's a it's a yeah they're Washington corresponded ones come out and and and and I guess maybe we'll do it but it goes to your point that's the only reason I mentioned that um that\n... yeah the interest\nIn these races go beyond the borders especially when it's something like a wage issue and in Flagstaff it's the wage issue it would be the highest wage in the nation it'd be higher than uh Seattle York things like that so it has a great importance but I don't think people are outside\nSpending I don't think there's Arizona spending money in Montana not to the toms dire level now you got to understand that the the rumor is that he has\nPolitical ambitions everybody knows his name now yeah the only word whether you were you like them or you don't it's working so he's spending all this money\nHe's a multi billionaire so they say are you spending all this money in multiple states on multiple issues he went on or was it CNN this past weekend and I think he called Trump you know bad things and then Trump called him the arranged on Twitter battle back and forth is billionaire versus billionaires spy versus spy\nAnd I'm so everybody knows and Trump helps feed into that because he's also getting his name out there so it's working and I would expect you'll see him running for president as my guess\nGeoff if you had one that billion dollar lottery\nYou could be president [laughter]\nYeah yeah you need a few billion ... billion ...
