communication involving the great American magician escape\nArtist Harry Houdini Houdini and his wife best were fears the bunkers of psyche ability mediums and spiritualism movement in fact Houdini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and there are fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving for unexpected punches was abdomen by McGill University student backstage at the princes theater in Montreal Canadian connection there\nOn his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of\nAfter death communication if he were able to get a message to his beloved wide best he would do so\nThan more than two years after his death his wife best attended the sands conducted by medium psychic Arthur for during which for allegedly channeled the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to\nBy Harry and bass\nInitially best stated publicly and assigned and witness testimony that she believed Terry Haddon fact communicated to her from the grave\nLater however she recanted and stated publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the chaos despite this best continue to hold highly publicized San says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nI had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in\nI just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA door oil was a prominent spiritually so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an a vow to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fine in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as and they had a friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fan just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of a\nDiscord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise]\nWhat do you call it the automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\nAnd Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing um and Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact\nAnd that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI was he sort of out or in public didn't need any out her ...\nYeah yes yes I started to talk overview um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow no part of this debunking of that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience is how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photo psychic act\nOr on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coded method\nThat that Harry in best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody methods\nI think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of ten words\nAnd the tenth word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one through can and number can can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly to the date\nOn a coin so that's how the trick would normally work\nBe taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly to the date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry in best first met\nEighteen Ninety four that's when they got married\nWould do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket ... All right what is the last two digits on the coastline and they these were rich\nAnd pray answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sent tens like quickly Harry I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural miss to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins the best held in her hand was a let's\nSay Eighteen eighty age and because she would say she's communicating doing verbal using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eight wording in the\nRise you could code emitted so so he knew that one of the numbers was age right and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right mix size right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing and pretend that they have been doing that and that's what we're used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look be quick and as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical\nDot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry I Know\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this code because after the message was delivered to pass and she said that it works somebody quickly said hey this was all in a book is all already published in a book this is no big\nDeal well I thought I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within the book but they wouldn't say the name of the book out of the people were saying it's on page the other that died and they wouldn't have a name that is driving me crazy and then I finally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look\nIn the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county\nAnd for all of twenty five cents they would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out and eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just follow that may not say there's a link inside there they'll show you scan of this book and so that book does talk about those ten were\nAnd how it's used to form numbers but not out a form we're\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book\nAnd um it see I hear a bullet points about this that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coded word rose about that the secret message wouldn't code word but leave and the actual\nSecret ten ... message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask you this is he also was a famous magician and he's a close personal friend Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book\nEveryone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important for you to point out that this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini\nA and therefore it may have been possible for so much to know about that because\nNow we get into the say on and and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this is actually true but allegedly he told them that I'm a skeptic I I I'm into bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way\nI can get a message to bass I Will try and then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur forward how did he hounded for get in touch with bass\nWell I'll touch on that in just a minute but I just want to point out that I think that this worked because the bass and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments\nChecking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in\nNineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise] one of its clients is getting a reading and\nHarry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of hurricane Harry's mother intrude into the session and in this on putting the words forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that's gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have and she says\nIt's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or spirit was surviving gas and so is this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this any more they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford\nWas well aware of Houdini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and\nHer vitamins and enzymes who plays the nutrients cooked out of most commercial dark moods\nHe said I cannot up all night scratching his shutting is minimal and it is such a pleasure to have my calm relaxed non shedding puppy back and I have to think of for that\nDon't let your dog itch scratch stink or shed like crazy come to dynamite pro\nEight five night for two weeks one thousand eight five nine four to eight went down the I N o v I T E\nWho's Ninety seven point one the big talk more stimulating talk\n[noise]\nThomas resentful my guess is the author of leaving the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment didn't work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com Thomas Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens\n[noise] um\nAre there for it shows up and he Arthur Ford\nUsually works with the spirit named Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show or very theatrical show where Harry would work with Beth the same way they worked\nWhen they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her up well he was very poetic with very at times very touching and romantic and ah there were statements like throw open the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this pen\nKey words on the table and then they coated them and after it was decoded the message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that that is a nickname\nThat Harry used for her with Roosevelt and this came about through popular song right around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside\nHer wedding ring and so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her and\nThat anyone noted did anyone knows it or the Ford no that Roosevelt was the pen name for best there was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends um\nSo I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on his kind of set up\nSomeone said that uh there was a big romance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he had he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah\nI just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt with the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other ...\nAnd and again he just he he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher just just didn't show the word believe they used the secret coating message that we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look can be quick in and these all\nWindy coated spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe\nYes yes and um\nShe declared the success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on that uh this is a lot of\nNonsense that wasn't true and and so that's that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary I Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence\nGiven to me by Arthur forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only her but three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press another one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that had happened\nI think so in effect of the newspaper articles that I was reading you could\nClearly see here in support for a good while and then around ... fourteen months after this there is a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now denounce that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever that this was a genuine\nContact so it's it's quite shocking um\nThere was any evidence whatsoever that this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with a um a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph or graphic rather than your graphics and tell me about this reporter ... is it read ... I Can't pronounce the name but I don't remember\nOne name but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited\nArthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in the closet but they're hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange well the person that shows up is not really author Ford it's someone that's been paid to in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says off I paid\nMrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because bass heard about as well as the reporter wrote this up and\nSo bass responded\nIn a letter 'em to that same paper where she just completely denies it there she's been a party of fraud in any way\nIf Arthur Ford said that they were in cahoots he's a liar I mean she's\nVery clear in this letter goes on and on and I'd never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted on a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nThere and this was written to Walter windshield the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the social\nGo to guy you know and um but this kind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the New York evening graphic but it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters the\nLetter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity you know I'm just telling you I was no party to any fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he can fast\nAnd then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time so Arthur Ford\nDidn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point that's Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened in one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends\nThey don't buy this you know they don't believe in their communication you know and so and I think that this faster\nShe was tired of being ridiculed by her friends being labeled and not um and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going\nTo go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like if\nAnyone says they get in touch with me after my death to know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise] um so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sand and twenty nine was she re camping and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen months\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award reward ten thousand dollar prize to any one to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if she really was in cahoots with Arthur Ford he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple

body will try and get themselves to walk every day the ... when that happened to him you know the our ways uh\nStarted to you know obviously you know we'll be non treatments came in and actually work each day that you identify with people who are suffering in your ... you lose the insect once or twice a humble pie actually stage of life\nRight I mean he displayed ... you'd have to call it of heroism or in the face of this uh this disease I mean he basically dragged he's he he had a hunch is Iran's but he would drag himself from miles\nYeah every day he had this regimen that um you know he had bars installed out in front of the Roosevelt mansion and he would\nCash in these races and he would use crutches and he eventually incredible but yet you know twelve pounds of steel on each leg in either\nThat's usually the initial incredible but it it you know\nPounds of steel on each leg and he was dragging his off if it's the ... parallel bars where he's exercising these arms up and then from the parallel bars closest route ... in front of a A R\nAnd Ben Ames turning around and dragging himself back you know quote unquote walking trying to fix stops and you don't believe it talked about iron clad well I mean that that was that was a was really something else a ...\n... want to come back that that part and then of course he ended up in Warm Springs Georgia was the warm waters with some of his wage and when my children and other people with other selections and actually impact as white to identify with people in need and suffered\nSo it really changes what for sure\nAnd then there's the fast track or to the White House I'm just sort of ... we we we've got about five five minutes before we head into the breaking the bottom of the hour but let's just give me a set of a sudden they'll sketch of of his journey to the White House or does it start with Governor of New York or is it under secretary of the navy\nInstruct for the White House started as a liberal Wilson and turtle rental house actually who Woodrow Wilson was his idol colonel house was Woodrow Wilson's won't you know what if the ... if he was a it was it was a hostile and plants and um they\nWere followed it's all in love with this communist ideal and um you know of course they didn't know anything about it but it was just really great than\nIt was through at 'em from house and I'm\nI'm a few hours connection with the ... system secretary of the navy and from their intended to use the Roosevelt million and that the political connections in New York to run for governor and then once governor I'm you know it was a it was a jump to the White House\nOne and a half into\nFrom out of the time when a ... some of the things that I Want it to\n'em over want it to do but you know he was\nLike it kinda didn't cooperate very well with with some of those were his ideas and now we don't have to jump right to a jump right to the White House and\nYou know start at the he originally ran on cash pots and everything and we realize that the the oldest working you completely flip and when you know with a socialist end of it and uh you know was amazingly ... even come like punching the suffering so\nRight well we'll get into the the new deal in the depression and and and so forth and and the fact that it will do this after the break but I just wanted to mention the idea that someone in a in a confined to a wheelchair warn that had a such a debilitating disease polio\nOr for that person to to rise to the White House at a time when as you point out in who murdered NPR at a time when a physical handicap like this was also also equated with sort of ... of mind and how\nWould that would I guess the complicity of the media it's sort of greed you know to not talk about it he never would have been president\nYou know it's amazing the parallels he made a very cooperative very sympathetic maybe you don't just like today well uh [laughter] it's like today without whether I like to give them some\nShort [laughter] yeah yeah absolutely halo suffering as he gets a free pass to\nBe a between these two guys will have to talk about when you get back but uh it's it's it's a history repeating repeating itself with the Russians and the White House and you know just all\nKinds of things it's incredible uh what's happening again and long known catches it you know\nI think something else but how is your parents or that no one\nSort of notice store or said hey wait a minute\nOur president does in a in a wheelchair or he can barely walk is he equipped you know this is thinking back then you know obviously we know better now but the idea that back you know Seventy eighty years ago um ... no one would take notice of that\nWell they they they pick their cameras shops well and actually I\nWould hope people for five years I got off the opposite you know this was the guy who said\nHe would he can really think on four or five thought processes that one is that what you really really really soft do when he would do is he like with the help of some one on one arm he will leave their arm and the help of the ... or something at the upper ... he would appear to be walking\nTo pick a couple of steps so they could I guess you know behind the podium use a little bit different than the shops and you know they they did it remarkably well so they they are to ward off the fact that ah in case anything good leak out\nEat painting insurance shopping to go public and claimed that you know I'm a ... so it was shown in for X amount of hours\nSo I mean the propaganda and all those oils Walsh anything back down you know it's just that\nThe media was smaller and easier to control that we didn't have other things that you know cell phones and cameras on the phone and you know they could get why they did that work\nFor him when he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which is seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't like the kind of cheated down a little bit\n[laughter] yeah absolutely the um\n... like\nThis is complicated I I'm ... that's\nThe point the lemon had changed the date in which the president was going to be one in from march until January so you didn't go go into effect until October of Nineteen thirty three which meant that Roosevelt had to wait to take off for or ex so this mystery\nThing all the hundred days and they still judge presidents where I live here

talk pastor Tim masters just into with Ninety seven point was the big talker\n[noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast amateur Sarah coming do you live from coast to Toronto, Canada affiliate in depth radio news talk ten ten\nSteve you be my guest who murdered FDR you know when people without these lists you know the greatest presidents and so forth FDR's often on those lists uh you know right up there with with Lincoln and Washington\nAnd Kennedy of course I'm ... FDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him and\nUh he certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is is in a mired in it you know horrible devastating depression like fifty percent unemployment and the bank system had failed and it's just sort of paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad ah you know the president preceding Hoover had a roaring accounting me going and of course remember remember the roaring twenties well there you go you know I'm you know things were starting to\nWe were starving children who are able to afford luxuries in the country but Hoover got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise your taxes and put some regulations on and you're that fast\nAnd ah you know so here comes FDR in ... a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering\nSo he has this has low vision of legislation a in a you know in order to help these people and also he thought and he did he did a great deal of hell for a lot of people we put people at work and it was on the government or the government paycheck\nAnd um this was the experiment from the communist communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp and Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information or was coming through\nHis friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and the New York city\nOr and so this is was their idea of how to help the workers in the working class\nAnd it was a flood of legislation or were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FDR regulated it at that point everything from farms to banking securities act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put every once in a working on the government do so we can have the\nCradle to grave wonderful society that Stalin and the Soviets had fooled us into thinking existed new ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing where we're going to escape the uh the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all this new wonderful\nPeaks and valleys of capitalism I think you meant the I think he's the communism so that people got imitating I'm Sorry about that I don't know where he's\nAt fault and valleys in ... of of of capitalism you know so right\nYou mean if I might you because you you are you you print the list of legislative uh\nUm\nActions that were enacted a in in who murdered FDR let me just read here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy acted beer wine revenue act\nOf creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief fact agricultural adjustment act emergency far mortgage jak tendency valley authority act securities act aggregation of gold payment clause homeowners look lone act\nGlass Steagall banking act natural industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act and the farm credit act um\nAnd he I mean he did this\nReally without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically ran it through I wasn't going to everybody that Richard I'm\nYou did that I well I'm happy to\nWithout much cooperation from the Congress didn't\n[laughter] he just basically ran that through I wasn't going to bore everybody with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I was I think\nI'm happy for them with it here [laughter] so I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was re out of almost like the communist manifesto that they had the kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it ... it certainly was the same basic control he\nWas can just like Stalin style and just purged all of his enemies you know if you've got no way of style and you know you ended up dead his first two wives his doctor who told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either disagree with America challenge and politically\nAnd that kind of Stalin did it FDR did it by what Patton the Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worry you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know a weary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought\nOkay so well all of this was going on in Europe is great war is brewing you know he's seen lots of Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it\nSo if this was a great a second new deal must be better so\nUh and they start to put a you know implement the second new deal and they start to realize that\nSubstantial portions of it were unconstitutional so the um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if you get it passed and that was I mean he was really really fiddling with things I mean a tremendous amount and\nI Know in the history books history books say a lot of things are I Know the history books paid him as this wonderful magical genie\nOf economic success he wasn't there was an economic failure people were uh they were surviving and that was about it that was about all they were doing and the you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services\nWe were ... you know we're we're we're still going to get the new deal for until his death I mean that was it was a it was a cat us it was a top because atrophy\nHow do you use the training with the enemy act or to gain more power lend lease dismissed planes you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\nWell [laughter] again when he did was he was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the St Louis is the same thing with the with the lend lease program\nHe was moving you know munitions in goods and services to the to the to defeat the axis powers and he was giving him to the to our allies you know free France including eventually this the Soviet Union\nSo that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time so there is a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started or he had to do that because it started to realize the new deal is not working\nSo there was no there was a lot going on economically in in our country\nAnd then there came to a point where he knew that we had to get into this war and the spies indeed and\nYou know we have spies who I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries have them we have spies to our spies in Germany were starting to tell us\nThey're finishing your heavy water experiments and with the pizza rockets to carry the nuclear weapons to all for instance the globe we'd be speaking German right now\nI mean they were on the brain so we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in

Nathan he is leaving coast to coast am to go to ferrier school\nOr not for your school ferrier school what is that you ask well so did I actually Nathan a it turns out like his granddaddy back in Kentucky is a horse lover a horse enthusiast and Nathan is going to I'm a ferry your school to learn how to care for horses who've\nA sort of like giving a ... to the er echoing set and and had a shoe horses which I think it's just a totally cool vocation kind of a throwback a I in fact I thought that job that kind of gone the out of fashion sort of like ... at the bowling alley which was a great after school job for kids back in the day\nAnd he'll just says well I don't care I Want it to do it so\nStalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little little hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging at his style on the table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a the conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran\nI think in a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and again for forty three correct they have an even at this point they have their eye and sort of carving up the post war world\nA instill at this point you know I I think she was Roosevelt still looks pretty robots or you know he you know by by standards in Nineteen forty he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was in when I'm relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three\nUm but I Want to back up with a minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were [laughter] what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards\nBecause deathbed confessions come out diaries or published a you know ... ... documents are declassified and then you can really go back and really and that's what I like to do um some people right to make friends I write to solve murders a call me crazy\nSo you can really go back in pieced together the snippets of of what was going on so\nI'm the decay inspiring with the Nazis firing\nA was a large aspiring American history thirty three members\nAnd that they were over here to assassinate and sabotage anything as they get their hands on um operation Pistorius' or was another Nazi aspiring eight members or they were created after Pearl Harbor\nOr they attacked Chilean targets and has a state and they were all caught and I leave each one of them except for one seven of them got the electric chair one got Thirty years in prison because he flipped on the other ones\nDid they ever get close to Roosevelt\nOh yeah absolutely they did but Stalin was closer Stalin had infiltrated so much Roosevelt Roosevelt's I'm White House it was it was incredible so this is it this is what I was saying about\nThe parallels to modern day and people think oh this was Seventy some odd years every five years or whatever what have you oh this you know this was all history is not all his reasons repeating itself okay so here we have in the White House again\nI'm Roosevelt was\nBasically screwing everything in the White House and here we have another up another president who's accused of all of these things prior to being in the White House and uh the the Russians had completely infiltrated the communist completely and frustrated of FDR's White House\nAnd we'll talk about that I'm sure it on the road and here we go again here's the Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating his White House so\nHe'll give me an example of give me an example in in Roosevelt White House of some of the communist and they had he's here\nWho are the first communist that overhead as there was a Monday house which was um a Woodrow Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth it came that were involved in um FDR's White House I couldn't list them\nAs far as um the communists and so forth they came that were involved in um FDR's White House\nI couldn't list them all uh there there were there were hundreds of at least Fifteen high ranking officials and half the White House winnowing communist starting with Harry Dexter\nWhy all the way through the elder his\nAnd they were in all kinds of different uh and also Harry Hopkins which turned out later he was fingered in Nineteen Ninety\nYou know talk about Harry Hopkins at a at length later so they don't get bored and go away it's more common [laughter] um\nThe or the White House at the White House had been infiltrated in the following places that I could find the agricultural adjustment administration the attorney general's office the department of state the national labor relations board\nThe labor advisory board\nOr the war productions board the price of administration the U.S Treasury Department U.S Treasury department was infiltrated by the communists was incredible and the public welfare committee so I I won't bore you on with the laundry list but it's in my book of all of the people who were\nYou know who are in that list or who are high ranking officials in those are in that list of of people so I mean he was just\nCommunists were all around them Harry Hopkins actually it was the HHS secretary of state he was one of the architects of the new deal it was one of FDR's closest friends in confidence and he was one of the top officials who sent to you know obviously every every I couldn't travel very well\nBecause of his affliction and you know the races in the wheelchair and so forth so we had to have someone fly over to talk to Stalin and so forth and uh that person was Harry Hopkins\nUm who's Harry Hopkins actually was a friends of Eleanor Roosevelt 'em through the ah CPU essay the Communist Party United States which is still in existence by the way I don't know if I mentioned that or not\nAnd how they Hopkins in down and get on\nFamously he was actually ... Harry Hopkins as\nTime went by he was also architect below my lease program to help the Soviets out So Harry Hopkins famously got along with Joseph Stalin because Stalin was warming waters in America will be for all of this happen okay I'll get to that in a minute\nOr he was Harry happens afterwards fire afterwards was fingered by a KGB the factor and I'm going to butcher this name\n'em all they grew up ... and there's a name here I just simply couldn't even begin to pronounce they both identified 'em they were both KGB the factors they both identified Harry Hopkins is the mysterious agent Nineteen who is contacting a Soviet Union\nAbout uh the the than on a project which of course we all know is a nuclear weaponry so here we have I mean there are informants inspires all around the FDR so so the point where he goes to the Toronto\nConference you know I mean I feel a style and knows more about Roosevelt than Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt meeting at these conferences it was just it was incredible how how penetrated the Americans were er at the hands of er and then I see is weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill him\nStalin right information right he had\nPlans in the post war world of taking America was have communist anyway he had plans of taking over America and making them a full communist country with him as a ruler so he was a little diluted in his own in his own right but how this all happened was\nPrior to this of course this was a new ideology communism while this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does this and that\nAnd you know we don't have to go to work in every word is provided for well Stalin had sent invitations to\n'em or directors in Hollywood a union leaders are college professors he knew the target and they would were sent invitations all expenses paid to go over to Russia to see how this this work\nAnd they went to a city in the city's names is\nA thing on it it is are listed in my book in the they were to observe how\nRussia did things and how everyone was care for how this worked in how terrific it was and look at what we've done and you need to do this to your country has your you know look at you look at your depression that's going on and so forth he really sees the opportunities town was not a stupid guy\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how and they tried to recruit anyway you had loudly\nSo it was a fictitious found that didn't exist there was made a cardboard basically\nSo they can village a Potemkin village and there you go um\nHe sends all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country meeting our country and to this wonderful new ideology they didn't know anything about evil umpires you know in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings and sprinkling by Stalin style as the puppet master\nHe uh he's this guy what he managed to accomplish in his wife was incredible he was one of the six original members of the votes of the revolution and he ended up there just to make fun of style and\nHe was nothing more than a he used to keep\nThe party journals and use the column comrade with Conrad index card used to call them ... used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless when the party\nOne by one he knocked off everyone in the party to take control\nI mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was standing stop I'm I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote that in his a quote from London's will come redstone is to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after Stalin's death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\nDial pound to fifty on your mobile phone and say the key word free bottle again

post world are so much of the\nPost war world is a result and then in the ensuing Cold War and and all of\nThat really is a result of FDR's frail condition he's greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference\nAnd you also in forty four when when that post war world was really carved\nUp and style and obviously you know took advantage he seized upon Roosevelt sprout condition or and and um\nFDR really didn't know what happened he was so out of it but\nI mean you you look at those pictures of FDR at the the ultimate conference and obviously he is he he looks like death warmed over but seven months before at the Tehran Conference he looks as as fit as a federal I mean ... what is going on with what happened in those seven months\nWell up until this point we've been talking about the bond that we haven't talked much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with him um FDR's being slowly poison from within the White House and I have to be very careful here not to give this book away but\nIt was a type of poison we're used to thinking of America is the leading edge on things and knowing all these things and what they were poisoning with with something that was\nPlentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet but\nThe rest of the world certainly did Europe certainly did some of those countries in Europe or Fifteen hundred years old maybe older so in certain situations they hit a jump on us and you know I don't think grandpa Walton would've known anything about poisoning or the after effects of this poisoning especially because they didn't know it was poisonous at the time\nSo FDR as being slowly poison from inside the White House every time he goes away too Warm Springs Georgia\nTo sow his ailing legs\nAnd go on a retreat so he can mentally and physically rejuvenate himself he starts to get stronger every time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or so I\nI did a little digging into this because it was just so what started me on this whole thing of FDR I thought it was a little suspicious and a little too convenient that in\nThe tiny Marcia Eighteen days\nA Roosevelt Hitler and Mussolini had all died conveniently it'd be on the door I thought that was a little convenient\nSo this is what people ask me it would just start looking into this for and this and that I also thought I was interviewing the FDR just died of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's bunker I thought that was a little to get a little bit convenient so\nAnd when I started to dig in and I saw that the the odd deterioration of this president during this time period\nAnd said you know wait a minute I I really got to look into this I didn't believe it in high school when we were taught about it back then they actually taught history you know I mean\n[laughter] it but in the book you point out how his his doctors\nI guess Dr uh mcentire admiral a navy admiral mcentire his personal physician and is is cardiologist Dr Howard brew in\nThey were they had no idea what was going on with him they were doing X rays and take doing all of these tests they were really clueless\nWell and this is where you know this is where the rubber finally starting to meet the road for me they really work for what they were thinking the American public just thought oh he ... himself out for us and you know he was the advance of polio and this and that and the other thing in\nThe symptoms of his doctors were absolutely baffled he had a bunch of doctors Emma Ross McIntyre who's the White House physician who was also the vice admiral and in a certain sort of in general and then they\nUm you know he was FDR's physician from thirty to forty five until he died a Dr Howard ruin was a man during a navy a course of years\nPhysician from thirty to forty five until he died\nA Dr Howard brewing was a commander in the navy a course FDR's a navy guy who's going to have maybe doctors or he was chief of cardiology hit the fat as though I mean these are heavy hitters they have no idea what's wrong with this guy\nNo idea [noise] so what they do is they take him to the doctor of the day and the reason why they're so baffled as because FDR is getting sick after\nMeal times this is my first hand something was wrong in his blood pressure would bounce he would go normal and then it would go it would go warring out of control three ten over one\nNinety five or something and it would be up there and then it would come back and they were trying very hard to every ... wasn't responding his body wasn't responding to anything that they were giving him\nSo we know when they when they\nGot to this point they should look at you know Nineteen forty four is rolling around this guy's going to run for president again again [laughter] and we've got to get to the bottom with how's it going on here so they send them to the doctor of the day\nDr frankly founder of the lead clinic in Boston and he's a surgeon and he is the guy\nIn America at the time so he examines FDR in March in Nineteen forty four\nAnd um when he comes out was is a ... a glaring statement which is now available online you can look it up at the History Channel basically saying that this was a dead man walking\nAnd do what he the laundry list of symptoms that he reveals that FDR has does not align with the advance of polio\nThey advance they align with the advance of poisoning\nFDR as being slowly poison styling Stalin guide them I can tell you that I'm\nStyling wants FDR out of the picture or at least mentally incapacitated at the altar confidence because he wants to rule the world after yard he wanted to set up the for policemen of the world\nUm the United states Great Britain and China and the Soviet Union so they could all police there quarter of the world FDR didn't want to share the world with uncertain Stalin didn't want to share of the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world he was a megalomaniac\nWith what he didn't Soviet Union of course we didn't know that that wasn't wasn't you know reveal to us until years later\nWho was it they died that was part of the negotiations team in the U.S at ... ...\nOn the way back from the all time or one of Roosevelt aid died conveniently also on the brain ignorance\nBut there are people dropping dead around FDR of rain any resumes all over the place that no one writes about again no one writes about those are his name was ... Watson and he was a high ranking naval officer he was on the way like I Believe in that surround conference dies on the ship of a cerebral hemorrhage\nIt gets back he being FDR he gets back\nA short time later I'm FDR's personal secretary\nAlso named McIntyre into relation to the doctor Ross McIntyre he dies of his cerebral hemorrhage\nThe drug of the day is morphing rat poison\nIn its powerless tasteless odorless and its circulating over the place as a matter of fact style and got murdered or the rat poison or for him from ... from the internal is governor\nThat came out later as well so there's a lot going on war friend is not what got FDR would have been to sudden it would have thrown up too many red flags okay style wouldn't want it to deal with Harry Truman you want it to deal

newspapers the explosive re meant a Saudi\nGovernment appointed newspaper editor has is to ensure that nothing remotely resembling honest journalism makes it into the papers so when the Saudi ruling

handsome living which according to Mr Bradlee here has always been his top priority\n\nTo show he had this undeserved status in the west that our caller is talking about because of the publicity surrounding his firing as editor of the Saudi daily all what town back in two thousand three\nHe was dismissed from the Saudi daily newspaper because he allowed a columnist\nTo criticize an Islamist thinker considered to be the founding father of ...\n... overnight to show he became known as a liberal progressive in the Saudi kingdom and outside and that's another reason why the left in this

have to wonder for us and that's the first time and fifty years wave started going to church and\nThey said well we get one time the kids for a low and he's always had that problem in their heart\nWhere I'm Still felt that way for people that are born with disabilities\nAnd let them tell them\nThat are in pain or they're tortured by their parents at crush on him and he doesn't understand why God somehow can't stepped in\nAnd they are protecting them and I don't know what to say that have um we have a very large extended family and we don't have anybody that [laughter] kind of thing and I I don't know what to say to him\nSo so you don't have any ah any children with disabilities and your family at all yeah just something that\nTell her I don't know that sounds so and that's never happened in his extended family on his side [noise] I don't I don't understand except you have very large heart\nIndeed I I I think that is a that is normal to believe that and wrestle with that that\nPart of life and go well where are you got an hour where where are you with\nThe children and and to try and kind of\nYou know put that in a place that's comfortable even with your face is difficult so first and foremost I think it's completely normal and a healthy place to come from\nUm however there's a lot more to it than just will help and bad things happen and how bad things happen to children the reason why people tend to go to children is the assumption that children are innocent because they're so young tech to clean the scheme of things not the case um\nA lot of people don't think about this but you know if a child had the strikes\nIf you didn't bring it it's food it would crush your head\nUm the child doesn't have that strike so a wrestling with whether children are are innocent by biblical standards or not is a is not necessarily worthy of this discussion but is an academic one nonetheless I Will say that uh\nUh that this question deserves a little more focus so if you if you have a moment I'm gonna ask you Jeannie that hang tight as we take a really quick break\nAnd I want explained a little bit of a the dynamics of what goes on because everyone comes and says hey how come you don't do it this way God or why wouldn't this weight work wouldn't that be much better and we'll look at those options and I'll show you why they are better at all\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nMan man\nBut Jesus Christ show will return to be hard of a show called\nCow [noise]\n\nOf course not of course not so what she looks at is the quality well why does this happen at all and and why would you know why we got allow this it has to be allowed in the process of things because in order to eliminate that I'm very boy that possibility would be to have to take away\nThe consequences of anything that people did wrong\nAnd you have to allow consequences in life 'cause that that helps build character it's like um if you think about all the wonderful things in life that you know ability courage all these things\nDo you need those don't exist without adversity do they uh you know a fireman or a firefighter cannot be a hero without a fire or some sort of adversity same with a law enforcement or anything like that so the balance of adversity\nAnd faith in strength and ability and all these things love versus a indifference or even hate that these things only exist in this world in this way because this is not the best world Jeannie it's the best way to the best world which is heaven\nAnd the reason why I say to the best ways because you have to go through this process\nOr to understand\nAnd therefore once you're in heaven there won't be that there won't be any a disability in heaven there won't be in tears in heaven there won't be any of that but you're there has to be those things as long as people a\nMess with the genetic line by doing what they want when they want\nA and a once again I Want to clarify this because some people try and push this on to the parents and if you remember in scripture um if someone came to me and said uh you know this man's blind why is he blind is it something is it a sin he did or send that his parents did and I said ... neither have nothing to do with that um\nBut the line that genetic wine does have impurities in it that people are placed there that were never supposed to be there in the garden it's not the way it was designed and so these things take place and I know that\nThat it affects people and affects people like your husband um but he has to see that in in order to eradicate all of that I'd have to eradicate everyone's free will and in doing that then what do you have\nThen you have an entire planet um that is disabled or spiritually and more morally because you you wouldn't have any option to do things differently I I'd have to program you\nAnd it's it's like saying you know ... you can keep your child safe if you lock them in a closet to [noise] but then what does he become\nSo I'm not going to lock you all in closets and make all the decisions for you what I'm going to do is I'm going to stand over here and I'm going to show you every single day by knocking on the door of your heart that I Love you and then I Want to come in and if you allow me to come in\nAnd you seek my will any read my scriptures and spend time with my people and and pray to my father and these types of things than you will start to learn that the system's okay\nBut meanwhile you know I'm sure your husband's speeds on occasion or does things that are against the law even little little breaking little rules here and there because he thinks it's okay but that that can affect people\nYou know and that can that throws off the system too and and that's in small way but in a large way there are people that the effect it\nDifferently and they you know will cause other things because of greed or because they think they're more important or they feel they're entitled or whatever it is and all that plays a part in there somewhere\nI Know you know uh I I Would hope that maybe maybe your husband might get the opportunity to call some time so we could uh you know that this out together but I'm\nReally the option on the flip side is much worse than people think it is that what you have to take away is so great um that I don't think people really I'm really understand what's taking place\n\nCharles walk into the Jesus Christ show or and she is Charles uh I have a\nCousin who um confirmed atheist\nMhm and uh you gotta love that yeah affirmed atheist

explain or about a journal revelation\nCelestial revelation romance I don't think I'd have to go to John okay well\nBut you are right you are right on the money with that and and Romans won a is an excellent place to start but I Will tell you this um uh on this program we focus on through as you know and we focus on a answering questions 'cause that's an important part of of understanding and having faced\nA is is knowing what you can now\nThe interesting thing is that no the the quality of the question and what's being asked is important as well because you know like a a child when you go to correct the child you say you know hey a little Johnny you got to stop doing this and he says but to me was doing it\nAnd that diversionary tactic to get you to focus on to me and you're going to wait I'm Talking to you I'm here you're dealing with somebody talking to them about God\nAnd that diversionary tactic to get you to focus on to me and you're going to wait I'm Talking to you I'm\nHere you're dealing with somebody talking to them about God and they're saying what about people that don't know about God and they're not one of those you see the only person that can ask that question has heard of me you can't ask the question in less you already know about God\nSo it's like pushing it off on someone else ... there should be accountable for themselves\nSee what I'm saying that they're going oh but you you're going you need to know God they say but what about the people that don't\nAnd it's it's it's an academic way of pushing off what they should be realizing themselves so that's the first part I Want you to understand because it's kind of diversionary nature um but secondly I'm God says that no one\nIt's not about ignorance is game is not about ignorance it's about acceptance or rejection\nSo God's not playing with people's lives and like their dice and saying okay well you know this person is going to get a better better opportunity that person know scripture says that no one\nUh gets better or worse opportunity as a matter of fact it says the second coming ... happen to everybody has heard the gospel everybody has the fare option\nTo receive or to reject now Romans one is you as you started out with was a perfect perfect place to go because it talks about the difference of general versus specific or special revelation the differences is that it says in in Romans one that there are those that can just come out of their mud hut\nYou know knowing nothing and see the glory and know the authority of God\nJust like you can learn something from a painting you learn something about the artist or what have you people get caught in the in the confidence in the bowels of the name of Jesus and they think okay what's the power and then they know how or is not in the confidence in the bowels the powers in the authority\nJust like the old movies where they should stop in the name of the law it wasn't the L. A. W. had power it's the power and authority given by that jurisdiction a in a in the a justice\nOf the United states gave them power in ... so that could be seen outside of the courts now\nShe needs to

ask you sit back and sip a cup of coffee and let me share some words with you that will be encouraging enlightening\nAnd quite possibly even challenging to your life\nWe begin a series a few weeks ago\nOn the aspect of living a life of faith what does that actually mean what's it mean to walk the walk faced as it is something that we physically do is more a serial is it more spiritual or is it a reality\nOf something that you and I can live well as we've talked over the last few weeks it is a reality is something that we actually can live\nToday I Want to take it a little bit further into that series or as we continue a learning how to live a life of faith and and or want to talk to you on a subject to the title face believes even when we're not permitted to see\nThere is a passages scripture and due to run them each chapter twenty nine versus twenty nine is just probably one of my favorite passages and all of scripture and it it reads like this the secret things belong to the lord our God\nBut the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever that we may follow all the words of the lord\nNow what the word of God is telling us here is a couple of different things number one is the secret things belonged to golf I mean that's pretty simple black and white God is not going to reveal everything\nWell you know I I I Believe that the lord is gracious ... this is my two cents worth folks\nI Believe the lord has gracious in hiding the future from us now I Know that many of you listening to my voice today that probably say lord I'd love to sneak preview we might even say one more just give me a glance let me know how it's all\nToday that probably say lord I'd love a sneak preview we might even say well lord just give me a glance let me know how it's all going to turn out\nWith the fact is folks I I I Believe that that might be a sincere request but I think it would be sincere only if we knew it was going to turn out okay\nWhat if it was going to turn out bad what at the end of your life didn't turn out quite the way you were hoping it would you still want to know\nWhat's the the ... the scripture says the secret things belong to the lord but there's another aspect here folks the Bible says the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever\nOkay so let me reiterate we must accept\nThat we are not meant to know all things and the longer that we live the more we realize that God really is very good and very gracious in keeping the future from us you see I Believe it is God's mercy that veils our eyes\nBut there's another piece in this passage that there's always intrigued me the secret things long to God but the things revealed belong to us and to our children\nBut there is a reason given here why are the secret things belonging to God why are the things that God won't reveal to us yet there are many things that God does reveal to us well the scripture concludes by saying that we may follow all the words\nThat holds the future as a a chapter forty six versus nine through thin listen to what it says here remember the things I've done in the past I Alone and God\nI Am God there is nothing like me and only I can tell the future before it happens and listen what it says here and I was a chapter forty six and ... and he said every thing that I Will\nAnd everything that I plan will come to pass\nLet me share this folks the key to victory that we need in your life and in my life is to base our life on the secure certain promises of God\nThere's not a single person I Know that has unshakable faith the folks I tell you what I have another shakeup will God and that's where I base my life\nWhere do you base yours\nAre you basing your life on another shakeup will God if not don't you think it's time that you did\nSecond Timothy chapter one versus seven and eight and ... twelve says these words for God is not giving you a spirit of fear\nNor timidity but one of power and love and up self discipline so never be ashamed to tell others about the lord and don't be ashamed of me either even though I'm In prison for God\nWhat the strength God gives you remember we talked about that that Paul was talking about in in second Corinthians chapter twelve that he said he had all these struggles and all these difficulties yet God taught him that when he was a week\nThat in Christ he was still strong so pause right near the Timothy said with the strength that God gives you be ready to suffer for the lord\nFor the good news ... and ... and then he goes on to say that's why I'm sitting here in prison I'm suffering for the lord I'm In the here in prison and I'm living forgot I'm doing all God told me to do and I'm Still here in prison\nBut look at Paul says he said but I'm not ashamed of it for I Know the one in whom I trust and I am sure that he is able to guard what I haven't trusted them until the day of his return\nLet me let me make a couple of statements here a real quick God gives us\nFaith and then we develop that faith and that's what enables to\nHelp us live a face filled life to keep us from worry from frustration from anxiety\nWhat we're literally doing is we're trusting God is able to keep us in his care he's able to protect us in his care he's able to guide us in his care\nTo make it a second statement now faith enables us to live a life free from worry let me say it again phase enables us to live a life free from worry but let me say this I'm not talking about concern\nBe free from worry does not mean I'm Free from concern\nThere there's a great difference between being anxious about something and being concerned about something you see that have a concern or a burden that you take to God and prayer is one thing\nBut to be totally anxious or worrying about the outcome of something that's totally something else\nYou can have a burden you can have a concern that you take the God in prayer that's fine but when you begin to worry and ...\nYou can have a burden you can have a concern that you take the God in prayer that's fine but\nWhen you begin to worry and fret about the outcome of that situation that's totally another situation altogether I tell people all the time worry is like a rocking chair it gives you something to do but does it get you anywhere\nYou know the Bible has some three thousand promises\nThat are directly there to keep us from worrying about things the Bible talks about the the the term fear or not or or do not be afraid or don't fear\nAnd I've had people over the years say that it's in the Bible three hundred and sixty five times well I I've done some counting and I don't know that I can find three hundred and sixty five times I actually find a couple of hundred more than that\nThat it talks about but the the gestures there that there's nothing to worry about and the truth is this ladies and gentlemen at the moment you worry\nThat means you don't trust the moment you're wearing means you're not trusting and the moment you're trusting means you're not wearing if I'm trusting gone for the outcome why do I need to worry about it\nBut if I'm worrying about it why do I tell people I'm trusting God you see the moment you trust you stop worrying but at the moment you worry you stop trusting and you know the Bible tells us in Romans chapter Fort timbers twenty three what ever is not a faith\nIs sin\nNow I Know some of you listening to my voice are still asking that same question how can you live in an uncertain world and still live a life of certainty in Christ folks helped me a ... let me say this let me say this okay we we don't\nHave to know the way all we have to do is walk in the way he is the way he is the truth he is the life and when we walk in him you see he knows where we're going he knows where ever been and it knows where we're at\nHe knows\nWhere we are and my knowing that ladies and gentleman we can face an unknown future\nBecause our confidence is in a well known God we have faith in him Paul writes in second tendency to give comfort and confidence to a young man by the name of Timothy look what he says here in second tendency chapter one verse seven you said Timothy God has not given you the spirit of fear\nHe is not made you timid\nBut he is giving you power and love and self discipline he has given your power the fact that you can do all things through cries to get your strength we find that in Libya's chapter four verse Thirteen he is given you he has given you a lot of the\nBible says and first John chapter four verse Eighteen perfect love cast out fear\nFor where there is fear there is torment\nIf you're living a life of torment and uncertainty you're not rested or secured in the love of God\nSee he said I give you power I give you love and then he said these words I give you a sound mind\nThat means you're literally in control of your thoughts in first Corinthians chapter five versed in the Bible says we are to cast down imagination and every thought that exalted itself above the knowledge of God you and I are to keep that\nOkay so let's go back her second current Timothy chapter one per seven God is not giving you a spirit of fear or timidity but of power love and self discipline\nWell let's go down to second Timothy chapter for K. we started at at chapter one second Timothy let's go to the fourth chapter and see how Paul concludes his conversation with Timothy\nHe says this starting with versus five and chapter for he said Timothy keep a clear mind in every situation\nDo not be afraid even if you have to suffer for the lord\nAnd then he goes on to say and no matter what these situations he said work at telling everyone the good news and fully carry out the ministry that God has given you\nYou see what Paul is doing is he's sending Timothy you don't have anything to be afraid of you don't have anything to be ashamed up you don't have to be a have a uncertainty in your life\nNow now let me go on here and drop into the the uh six verse or seven first of second chapter for Paul is writing the Timothy an inverse is five and six and he's encouraging Timothy he's selling Timothy don't be bothered by all of this stuff\nAnd look what's happened to Paul Paul knows that he is about to give his life literally give this life for the lord and he writes here look at this time of my death is near\nThe time of my death is near Paul knows that he is going to die for the Lord Jesus Christ and look what it says here he he talks about living a life of faith\nAnd he is going to outline it for is real quick he said you want to know how to live a life of faith he gives it in the next sentence he said Timothy the top of my life of my death is near but here's how I ... you said I fought a good fight\nThat's the reason I finished the race and what gave me the ability he said I kept the faith I remained faithful\nHe said I thought a good fight and because of that I finished the race ladies and gentleman this Christian walk it is a fight\nIt is a journey that will be filled with struggled at times difficulty at all yeah it'll be smooth sailing at times but God has never promised you a life of smooth sailing\nThere's so much electricity I mean you could literally feel it was awesome walking through the parking lot to to get to the tour of Fela very nuclear power plant I there's high tension power lines I could literally here and feel the electricity there's so much electricity coming off of this thing [noise]\n\nWe generate more electricity for the last twenty sixth consecutive years and then you know the power plant in the U.S and we took great pride in being part of Arizona a and being the largest is just a fun thing for us up\nAnyway so I walked to the parking lot I get up to the security checkpoint mediate PS person and I want to tell you I'm In this post nine eleven world security is a huge thing you know here you have a nuclear\nPower plant and they've got a you know materials in there that let's be honest bad actors would like to get their hands on right now but I can tell you security was super tight\nSo first of all if you're a worker there are they at hand prints a hand scanner things like that are you all wear a badge I had to have ID with my uh with a badge on it I was escorted with the armed security into the facility a big steel gates et cetera et cetera ... these are highly trained folks by the way the security people\nA former Marines are a form of military or\nOn and on highly trained individuals with with a ours and and and so forth and so on so anyway I get in there it's a small group there's like five of us on this tour\nAnd we had up to the uh\nArea where we are going to suit up to go into the containment building and the first thing I noticed and I have pictures up and talk with Jeff dot com there's a table with all the gear we have to put on\nAnd there's a ton of gear you have to put on booties you have to put on multiple layers uh pants a head gear just multiple things and then they give me this device it's called\nIt's the thing that detects radiation and tracks the radiation and your exposure I I Believe it's called the radiation December I could be wrong with that but we had a briefing and the folks are super professional they told us all about what you expect and what they're looking for as\nFar as opposed to any for over\nA while to get the point five we look around and reading you know again none of our um so\nWe don't anticipate that you look at it a little you're going to be probably about ... ...\n... you know the item hold on for years so I'm hoping is that a lot of the whole you know all of\nOur phone\nJust plant lay it out of his or her out of your brother um got thrill environment so that's real faith ... priority radiological through right up there [noise] um so we ask that you ... is our ground I'm\nAll right so I'm all suited up right and I got to tell you I'm getting hot and this isn't an air conditioned basically office were not inside the containment building yet\nAnd you get a little nervous because you know you ... I had to sign a radiation work permits or to go in to go to the next stage anyway so you know you get a little nervous you thinking oh what am I getting myself into study where they walk down a hallway we're heading towards the containment building\nAnother layer security you have to go through and a lots of people do workers going in there to do their job that I Can't tell you how many people were carrots intense\nSo next we get near the containment building\nPicture like a bank vault big steel door a pretty thick steel door you have to go through a another area they brief you and then you go through this big steel door into the containment building\nAnd you're going to need to hold on like she said to those handrail because there's cat walks everywhere so they walk us up\nWe're over the reactor\nWe're looking down now there's workers' down there\nWith gear like ours maybe even more intense they're they're they're working out the says they change out the fuel a that's why we're in there at this point and we're looking down below where they're working where this core is where the reactor is and and all the rides where they put the fuel\nNow they're going on and on and and you know we ... we had a great guy by the way are telling us how this all works but you know I'm sitting there sweating and you know we're up high on the little cat walk or looking down a but\nHere's what they explained to us and and I'll bring back in a de chief nuclear officer ... meant to explain kind of what they're doing and what are what this process is and how the uranium works we take\nA low enriched uranium and uh we put it in into the core ... we replaced few every Eighteen months so it's not bad when you only have to stop and go up every Eighteen months [laughter]\nUh so uh editor my car exactly [laughter] mine to hug going down the hill I get better gas mileage our own myth or as I Would go back and finish so [noise] but [noise]\nWe put a new fuel in every Eighteen months and then we start the unit up\nUm in what we do is we cause vision of the Iranian Adams and their cousins heat and ah it heats water\nThat water heats additional water which causes steam we send it down down the pipes and turn a turban a turban has a generator on the end of it generates electricity and then we raise up to five hundred thousand votes and send it to ... people across the software\nSo anyway I'm On the catwalk they're explaining all of this while I'm up there but you know what I'm I'm sweating now you're not supposed to touch your face you faces exposed and ... and of course as soon as you put all his gear on your your your nose itches or something but you can't touch your face so we're on this cat ... walk there explaining all this I'm just like zoning out I'm looking at this\nUh you know I'm looking down at the reactor and these guys are working down there\nI'm looking at all these types and wires it's just an engineering marvel and I'm trying to think about who the heck even thought of this stuff\nAnd so they're trying to explain they're doing a good job but we were just all like sweating and just it's beyond our comprehension to see how this thing works so anyway we spent some time inside the the containment area looking at the reactor normally this would be where you'd look down\nWhere the rods are or where the water is and there's usually a blue glow and they control the amount of a heat up by lowering and raising those rods\nAnd that creates the steam and turns\nWhere the water is and there's usually a blue glow and they control the amount of a heat up by lowering and raising those rods and that creates a steam and turns the turbine we'll get back to that here and just a second\nBut after we're outside so we walked back through that big steel door\nWe had out of the containment building\nAnd then this is interesting now you have to um now I don't want to use the word ... robe no it wasn't that you have to take off before you exit that radiation area you have to take off all the gear that we spent a bunch of time putting on earlier and there's a bunch of garbage cans lined up and you basically go through a whole process\nOf removing a first you remove your boots and you throw 'em in with your fingertips into the garbage cans they apparently take this and they destroy it all they don't you read is that they destroyed awesome company does it\nSo you\nGo through this line and each time there's a pad and it has like feed on I think like an airport and you have to kinda hopscotch to the next section and then take off more layers and ultimately you get to the front of my ... and we didn't we didn't stripped down to make it or anything they weren't hose indiscriminate down now you get back to your original clothes\nAnd you get it all off and then you get to the front end there's there was a girl there and you step over the line basically and she scan\nShe uses a Geiger counter to check your hands and your feet mixtures in any uh any ... radiation radioactive particles I don't I don't know if she did but I'm looking at this meter and the thing spike and it's going up to like popping up like a hundred and I'm like ... you know this isn't good\nI'm going to be in some kind of you know radiation quarantine and she's like she laughs at me she's like no this is you get more radiation exposure in Flagstaff at that high altitude so\nI was cleared we moved on but it's not over then you have another\nSecurity check a there is a machine that's like it's like a mold over humid\nYou know what I'm saying and you have to stand in it ... and it detects if there's any radiation you then you flip around it ... the the other side of you then before you can exit that area you leave that machine there's another machine that looks like a kind of like you know metal detector\nAnd you're sitting there for like ten seconds and it's detecting if there's any radiation you turn around and says it again and it any way cleared me and then finally\nWe go back to our our radiation specialist who did an awesome job and we had them are radiation December that that that device that detects your exposure and they check it so another ... there and um my red zero zero exposure within um within the containment building\nSo it all wet well it was absolutely amazing we continue to tour and the whole point of this is to generate electricity so they took us into the generating room\nThis is where the steam goes in big long pipe basically and it turns the wheel that creates the electricity I don't know how to do it but that's that's how they you know turn the wheel to create the electricity this thing is like the size of my house\nAnd he's explaining to me I'm Still not sure how the electricity is created from the radiation from the steam from the other room that we're just stand up to this point so so he kinda explains it to me\nThat All right you\nCan see from our hair\n\n\nThere is that Republicans twenty five percent and independence thirty two percent is there a blue wave in Coconino county is a blue should nominate [noise]\nYou're listening to the best to

a financial generally jak here when I\nFrom northern Arizona for a financial dot com website\n... and ... feet again and you brought along a member of today right\nThat's right that's right I Need to introduce Stuart Lee Daniels Stewart\nJust rich\nYes I'm Stuart with you know what I'm used to deceive you're glad to\nBe here I previously around the last election cycle actually during the primary represent every one of the house of representatives of the great experience and\nAll around northern Arizona and you might have seen my billboards and yard signs etc all throughout the northern Arizona region and a very active in the community and to look gorgeous to make a positive difference and helping folks out\nIn the region store joined us from is because he does have quite a financial background and you know I've had stored number of years ago as a vice president of the chamber of commerce you know and then there's a slice of chamber right and you know the thing is you know Stewart you really have a beautiful face or radio\nSo I should do to help out your guy either yo is that the big dig out of it is fair\nEnough but no real super excited at war or financial just do it on a team and you know he's going to be ...\nFair enough [laughter] but\nNo we were super excited at ... financial just doing it on our team and you know he's going to be servicing in working with the people in the northern Arizona so we have an office here in Flagstaff downtown Flagstaff as well as we have an office in Sedona that services or the tri city area which\nIs you know the ... what camp Verde area a plug down so far right low growth out there in in great opportunity to help even more book\nWell I'm Glad to have you in CDL as well Stewart and I know it's it's going to be hurting cats today with stuff that you that well the where\nWe just got an honorary today [laughter] they were here you're the roads between two story [laughter] we got a buddy of coffee you know that's why we're ready to Capitol\nI got my work cut out for me that you know one of the things we're going to focus on today that we were chatting about a little bit off line\nIs financial wellness and how much having a healthy mind and body really goes hand in hand with having healthy finances that you know what most of us know what to expect when we go in for a check up on our physical health\nBut we don't know what to expect for a financial checkup so that's where I'd like to begin today in ... how do we get started with that\nWell you know me being a doctor on radio so I think I guess I can talk about financial help\n[laughter] so\nI've always talked to people about a financial checkup\nIs extremely important and you know you have to have just like you would go get your you know oil changed on every three thousand miles and it's funny in our industry is that the you know there's a saying in our industry that guys take better care of their vehicle than take care of their health you know\nAnd in women live longer because they take better care of their health and so that's kind of the important aspect of what we're doing here and one of the things we found was that\nLike you're supposed to do a physical every year with a doctor in and get a check up and so for doing that on your finances extremely important as well because you know a lot of times you don't realize there's a problem and you know you're too far down the road\nAnd you know if there's any kind of corrections or strategy change that has to happen we want to be able to implement and make those changes as soon as necessary\nWe're talking today with ... owner and founder of our financial group and see where it may Daniel here as well he's part of the team that for a financial and I'm generally hack alongside it gives the retirement ... Howard for a financial group\nIs that when you get in your car and you start driving\nAnd the first stop you would say would be you know like going if you're on ice forty you'll be going towards Williams so first off would be Williams then it'd be so women then you'd be Kingman\nSo theoretically when you're looking at this you're not getting to check your tires and things like that until you get to a gas station right and if you need gas that's what you're doing\nBut what happens is if there's a problem in between that distance you're absolutely unaware of four fifty sixty ... even a hundred miles versus what happens in retirement planning\nIs that a lot of times people say you don't you know check a couple of years or you know most of the most of what we've seen is that people have come in and they said you know I had a financial planning done ten years ago mhm and I go and then what and they go up we\nWere ... years ago and I think we're on track I I don't know I I go how can you be so sure or are you sure and most people I sit down with they really don't limit their own track or not they just goes you know life is happening\nAnd we have an advisor that's kind of managing our accounts and I think we should be good when most people don't realize is when I first started in this industry back in the early nineties\nThe rate of return or projections that were being used were significantly higher\nThan what we consider using today and I was speaking to another financial advisor in our community\nRealize that they're using a pretty robust rate of return in projections on their portfolio so you know it always looks like you're going to make so much more money and then you create your spending plan around how much money you think you're going to have\nAnd then turn your good to have a significant shortfall because it didn't perform up to that level\nAnd so part of this also is we won't talk about risk management\nYou know if you look back you know this year will use this year as an example I I don't want to go very dated on the timing but if you just look back this year we've had significant volatility in the market\nAnd the recent months uh we've had quite a bit and I think people don't realize if the markets are up or down because you know and sometimes they turn on the TV and it says\nYou know the S. and P. hits new highs are Dow Jones industrial average has hit new high\nAnd they think that they're making all this money but then they don't realize that suit after that the Dow Jones industrial as going data of five hundred points or something like that you don't\nOr maybe several thousand points to like him that case so those are the kinds of things that\nOn data of five hundred points or something like that you know or maybe several thousand points in ... in that case\nSo those are the kinds of things that you know when we create a plan that's what we're addressing we're really addressing the safety component of your plan so here's the thing if you're going to Los Angeles and here\nAnd the road map you know your Google Drive or whatever you you have any more what do you call them nowadays\nBut over the navigation system navigation ... GPS to write you know I I still go back and think about you know like I was thinking about the Rand McNally road atlas writes most of us travel ban it in the day before all this stuff came out you know we have to we actually had to lay it out and make a plan\nAnd really understand that you know if you drove respectable speed limit and you know considering traffic and so forth that you would get to your destination\nIn a certain period of time and that's where people are really losing the focus is that you know too much electronic says in the way too much garbage is going in their heads from watching TV and so forth\nAnd everybody's chasing returns what I mean by that is that you know people are looking to make as much money as possible but they don't realize what the downside stroke up that would be right\nAnd if you just kind of go back and look at\nWhat happened to two thousand seven two thousand vein short here in Tucson at that time I was younger than you saw your big cities even worse\nOr absolutely seeing if folks there were a hundred percent tied into real estate because at the time you know the real estate market was booming in the early two thousand men and things were great into a woman and people lost half of\nTheir their value overnight they couldn't give it away correct right and we just saw people who were unprepared and and they didn't have they didn't realize that things aren't going to keep going the same way whether it's up or down and so not panic and that's the whole holistic approach\nBut it also provides opportunities as well you know how to\nWrite so you know I mean you know when we look at the market so we're seeing you know we have big upswing in the market\nAnd then you see big down swinging the market right and then\nWe see panic and we see we do you get to see all kinds of emotions right you know greed fear panic all that stuff right anger and you know we ... we find is that when people don't have a\nPlan the emotions get the best of\nRight and and bad things you know we we all go through difficulty throughout her day right that doesn't mean it's going to ruin our day\nAnd then that's the whole thing when we have a plan to move forward whatever it might be as we're going on vacation going on a trip whatever it is now we have a plan to move forward and that and that's how we approach or the financial plans as well and how important that is because without that plan that's when the panic that thing that\nWe've had a bull market for probably a decade at this point right and\nIt's been well you know like I mean if you look at the ten years the markets based up but you know the volatility that's have come into play has been pretty significant in two thousand eleven you know if you're just at home and one for giggles if you look at the Dow chart in two thousand eleven\nAnd you go back and look at two thousand seven two thousand eight charge\nIt was an exact mimic the markets and the charts for exactly mimicking that instead of going down\nWhat happened was the federal government stepped in and then they get infused much money in the market right and that's what kind of ... the mark it up and it's gone up since the end you know in the long term we see the markets will go up by the fact is that\nIf there's a major market correction\nAnd you know you're retired and you're living off this money\nAnd you're taking out say a thousand a couple of thousand maybe three and a three thousand dollars a month out of that account\nAnd your portfolio overnight just got chopped in half because the markets went down and be or just you know thinking it's a short term volatility and usually you know in in oh seven or eight when the market corrected that\nWas it all happened within six months and that was considered a short term volatility but he was a major market correction and if you know anyone that's retired um and they're retired you know seven away\nAnd if you're thinking about retirement and you're not really thinking about rescue should have a conversation with one of these folks that were affected by this and you probably know them and\nWhat happened there was if they were taking money out out of their investment accounts or the IRA count as it's chopped in half because markets went down\nAnd they took him seven years to get back to where they were but if you're drawing against it\nYou will never recovered that money and there's a great chance that you will run out of money a lot sooner and blunt nice speaking I be this wrecking ball we always talked about pendulum you know when the market's going one way it's beautiful you know everybody's smiling and laughing then too and\nSwing vent pendulum swings the other way [laughter] it's a wrecking ball you know to do a portfolio and you know like Stewart was a part of the of mortgage company and you know what was your toddler more mortgage banker or else the mortgage banker first magazine a financial and yeah\nThe company went out of business right behind it and that happened to to a lot of folks I mean companies that were highly leveraged didn't up again plan a for for a long term or the issues and and that's what happened with them\nAnd you know and the thing is that most people have to have a significant um analysis that you'd have the analysis done to understand what kind of risk they can actually afford to take right and you know we we do run into a lot of people say well you\nKnow I have bombs from my portfolio that safe\nI don't know how to answer this question but I always say you don't want to call people that own the LA county bonds reds [laughter] would last more they went bankrupt right or whatever your choice right and you know I mean you can go down the line and you know they're in depending on what kind of bombs you're buying\nBut you know I mean there's still a significant risk associated with it the other thing we also look at uh when we talked about the risk portion of it is that uh the fed has been talking about they're going to raise the interest rate\nAnd what happens in bonds that most people don't think about they think most people are taught wrong but they are taught that stock market and bond market work against each other meaning that the stocks are up the bonds are going to be down and bonds are up the stocks are going to be down well that is not true\nWhat effects the bond market is the interest rate in the interest rate is going up the bonds are going to go down in value and it you know if the interest rate goes down the bombs go up in ... values if you just mentally see a seesaw\nAnd if you put bombs on one side and you put the interest rate on the other side and if one thing goes up the other one's going to go down so you just keep that in mind so you know we always talk about creating safe strategies in retirement so if you're listening to the show and I actually have a gift for you\nThe risk against the safety the idea nudey would be the safe component that is correct but a lot of times what the advisors are doing is that they have their clients' money in the market and they sold client a annuity variable annuity just to generate additional revenues for their for their company\nAnd it's a it's a revenue approach it wasn't a holistic approach to planning\nAnd so that's one side of it right so let's talk about the the kind of a new disease that we feel good about and we like and those are called fixed annuities\nRight no fixed annuity is not going to make you rich if you think you're buying a fixed annuity because you're going to end up with a double your money five years it ain't happening\nRight now I'm looking at a guaranteed right of return and how right that is right in the idea behind that was really is to you know\nThe annuities the fixed annuities are designed not to make you rich but it's actually design from keeping you from becoming poor right and so within a fixed annuity a family they have one called indexed\nSo it's got fixed indexed annuity and the fix component\nMeans that your principal is not going to go down and index so everybody's heard about index funds would index funds to his mimic the stock market and the U.S and be five hundred the Dow Jones industrial average or you could have been asked that you get a Russell one thousand two thousand three thousand I mean she should have gone right right\nThere's a whole list of things you could index and so forth so these annuities actually have where you are right of return on your fixture nudity is linked\nTo the performance of an index and you're not going to make as much money as the index and you'll never make as much money as the index but what happens is that when indices go down\nYour money doesn't go down so if you take say I'm just using it as an example\nThat a hundred thousand dollars in let's say you make five thousand dollars in interest on that now that hundred and five thousand dollars with the fixed annuity becomes part of your principal meaning it's locked in it doesn't ever go backwards stock market goes down fifty percent guess what you get a big fat zero for returns and\nStill at the one oh five now still want to fight right in the markets come up that one of five will go up to whatever the next you know growth numbers and unlock itself but you know the thing is\nThat you give

nine to\nWait you to stick eighty two fifty five it's Ninety eight stacks talk\nAnd they tell me a little bit I batch risk management how do we now if we have the right amount of risk\nSo for starters you know what we talk about his rule one hundred so some people have heard it and you know we talked about this on the show in the past\nBut if you took one hundred and if you subtract your age from that\nSo assuming that let's say somebody sixty years of age right so you subtract sixty from one hundred answers forty and what that means is a forty percent\nOf your\nInvestment portfolios should be associated with risk and sixty percent your money should be somewhere safe\nAnd you know we talked earlier that you know people have the false sense of security when they own bonds or you know even they own variable annuities that have income riders and things of that nature\nAnd those things I consider those false sense of security because we're looking for is what is your real dollar\nWar not an income writer but real dollar and send this case where we talked about is if you were to take sixty percent of your uh investment or you know sixty percent of your account value\nAnd that should be somewhere safe and you know you could put that in CDs money market accounts but what do they pay today do you know now that is well almost nothing nothing right it almost ... so what happens there is if it even if you have one percent does matter but the thing is that you're going broke\nVery safely and you don't realize that you go broke right because your money's not keeping up with inflation\nSo you need your money working to or at least keeps up with inflation that means you're staying even Stephen but we're we're focusing on is actually growing it a little bit more than that so that you always have the growth factors associated with it especially as your expenses\nGo up you actually do better than in places where I could because as your expenses go up your health caustic cetera\nIf most people don't realize but their pension you know people were thinking that far ahead but they you know oh they're so worried about retiring and having enough money when they retire they don't realize\nThat the cost of living adjustments like you were you when you were working and you got to two percent pay increase or for three or four whatever or some of the some of you listening gold mine for hasn't given me a raise in five years you know because I mean there are some people that just a you know aren't structured that way but most most times when people are working\nTheir cost of living adjustment or as a as their income goes up every single year\nBut what happens in this case is that most pensions\nDo not have it cost of living adjustments so today you know the milk like we talked about in the past were laughing about um you were on the show but we had talked about you are when I first started driving you know gas prices were like eighty nine cents a gallon and\nI remember that you do write of flew under a hundred dollar hundred dollar right and so by the time I actually graduated high school\nOr the prices have actually gone up over like dollar Thirteen or so and you're you know what I mean today if you look at it it's you know whatever the price I Love to have those kind of gas prices right [laughter] yeah that'd be fun [laughter] but that was inflation right and\nToday I just just ordinary were just talking to a client of ours\nAnd they ended up buying a new vehicle and I asked him I said would you pay for the vehicle and and they told me the number and I do realize that your parents first house\nWill cost less than what you pay for your vehicle today and they're like that is so true you know that is so true and so you know we're looking for understanding how the inflation is going to impact\nMost addicts just want to get high they don't want treatment for use tough drug laws to put them in treatment and keep them there they

season of this old house and today is the final day of production we're right here and actually in the garage that it's a lot nicer than that sounds surrounded by the cameras and the thought us to bring you the story of a very ...\nThe final day of production but right here actually in the garage is a lot nicer than that sounds surrounded by the cameras and the sauce to bring the story of a very ... just completed\nBy the spectacular team at this old house now if you're not familiar with this area it's a very unique place with a lot of history Jamestown Rhode Island is a coastal town and says just across the Narragansett Bay\nFrom Newport which is home to many many famous mansions\nBut if it didn't happen to be named Vanderbilt or asked her do you may have decided to build a more modest cottage right here in Jamestown and many of these houses date from the late Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds when summer visitors\nBuilt them to enjoy the ocean breeze isn't the Sandy beaches but today many of those dwellings remain on insulated\nAnd since they were originally bill just for the summer season there was really no need for installation back then\nAnd that's what brings us to this old house which was rebuilt\nTo increase energy efficiency but keep the old charm now to kick things off I'm joined by this old house any contractor Richard drifting we walk and Richard thanks so much So Richard when we say that the goal was to make this home energy efficient we're talking like insanely energy efficient here because\nThe plan was to make this a net zero house over those are not familiar with ... zeroes how to explain that\nThere's a bunch of components to one is to make it insulated really well to make it incredibly tight and so we did that with our thirty walls in our forty ceilings and and we made it\nTight tight tight and then on top of it we we did another thing called aero barrier to make sure that we we controlled infiltration unbelievably I'll get back to the minute right so you got to make a place where the tight\nThen you've got to be able to make some electricity so we put Eighteen solar panels on this brilliantly designed garage which just is behind the building away so nobody sees it it's the perfect dangle\nAll this talk of home remodeling has you thinking about your next project\nYou can call in your home improvement question now to one eighty money pit presented by home advisor dot com\nWell this project involve both remodeling of a one hundred year old building in the building a brand new addition bringing those two together was the job or next guests Jeff swinger welcome just thank you\nNow you do a lot of building the Narragansett area and then we have a lot of summer houses here that we're probably never intended to be your own residences and and here we are putting heating systems in them and air conditioning and\nAnd insulation and trying to make it all work in this case you had even a tougher job because you had to make this net zero so that it basically\nIt's actually made all the energy that it needed now to do that you need to rely on a lot of systems with one of which was insulation still talk to me about the insulation that made it possible here\nYou know as you said this was a summer cottage are designed a you know in the Nineteen twenties or so where you had some structural framing members that worldly geared to support you know the roof load itself right a now today's standards with the insulation in the energy codes\nWe've got to make room for insulation or they might say that it's not even a so we had to do a combination of insulated from the inside with super high a fish and stuff like clothes so a spray foam right then we also had to insulate on the exterior of the building\nSo we added to the outside just as much as we added to the inside because we didn't have all room on the inside right\nNow they advantage to the adding to the outside is that you create that thermal barrier\nAround the the framing members which are much more conduct the transfer he also\nSo that was a critical part of this project now to the inside that finished I just walked through the house earlier just amazing carpentry in this job you guys that are really terrific uh works here with all the detail and the trims insurance and stuff to talk about huh\nWell uh I give credit to the architect on powers who are really just thought about\nEvery space in the house and took advantage of\nHis expertise in the design world and and really created a master pull\nA depiction of of water cottage built in you know cozy atmosphere would be in a you know all we did was follow his lead in a and execute a but I I give credit to him he he took advantage of every single corner in the house\nLos Altos are good partnership and unusual for you to have the architect is the home or your children's weapons designer\nYeah well it was it was really a little bit intimidating to start with that because um I you know held to a little bit of a higher standard as up to it it really turned out to be a really mutual relationship you know we collaborated on a lot of things Don wasn't a so\nYou know our meals are already you know right we were able to exchange ideas and um they were right down the road so it eliminated a third party in the middle so it really ... really did work out well\nAnd but as you say communication really is she now the exterior of this home had a lot of work done landscape you hit a landscape architect helping with that\nReally did work out well but as you say communication really is key now the exterior of this home had a lot of work done in the landscape you hit a landscape architect helping with that but ah you had to organize that part of the construction as well what was the challenge\nWhile the challenge was a it was a short period of time where we had to make a lot of things happen and we had three different porches which uh\nYou know cascaded down into the hard state and then we had a really extensive landscape plan you know it caught me by a little bit by surprise but when they started bringing the trees and the plants and I was amazed at how many plant things we ended up having\nAnd then they the landscape architect Tom Ryan did just a wonderful job at segment in different areas around the yard which are all\nMeaningful and well planned in a you know it it it came together\nWe can't wait to see it rollout chefs winter the builder on this project thanks so much for stopping by the money that was my pleasure you can follow along with all the progress here in Jamestown online at this old house dot com or on Twitter and Facebook has checked tier wage Jamestown\nWelder team at this old house didn't get all the work done

company I loved that you describe yourself\nAnd your audition tape as the quote balance of perfect deficiency in quality said this guy's got confidence [laughter] figured that was a good description yeah it was a good description that you get that from the marine corps the balance of efficiency and quality yeah it was it was definitely\nSomething I'd probably picked up some good traits in the marine corps and help out was\nWhat kinds of experience did you gather working here on this project\nI get thrown into a lot of different projects that I haven't ever touched before like doing a western red cedar Ruth I write in her I've never weaved orange cat before that I was a\nNew experience for me the whole uh insulation layers insulation and then uh the panels for this house rude or something that I had never touch before so there are few different or new experiences\nAnd marry you grew up in lumber yard to understand your father your grandfather were ah were in the lumber business\nYeah either and I find that right past a lumber brokers though so they're in town in that environment\nWhen you were working on your own house um what kinds of projects were you tackling

counting\nTook a made up for it to sink in [laughter] yeah I uh I actually thought that I didn't get it because the the uh contact us\nAbout a week after when they told us that we're going to tell his cage and right and then a center called me and told me that we got it in those kind of a kind of taken back by it well you\nKnow it was a good a good experience and a road that high for a couple of ... and and Mary thirty seconds or what was it like for you\nAnd and I kind of little [laughter]\nCereal yeah\nNever imagined in right Adam really what you are representing a lot of young people that are interested in the building trades and I know that you've been a great example for those inspired those that are thinking about getting into this themselves so\nThanks for your efforts I'm really

of the herd project on this these forty season of America's most popular home improvement show this old house and one of the guys who's been part of the fabric of this old house for over twenty\nIt's the forty season of America's most popular home improvement show this old house and one of the guys who's been part of the fabric of this old house for over twenty five years is general contractor Tommy soda you just keep getting younger don't you don't yeah [laughter]\nWell almost thirty five years yeah wow five thirty six years I mean yeah man it's amazing I hear and I'm Down in the first few years [laughter] what you played hard to get I ... well maybe that's it that way will turn it down because I work for my dad we would just do my dad he didn't want any part of the details anyway but now we're too busy\nTo act on TV so [noise] so I Want to talk with you first about the fact that a lot of the construction here was pre fabricated and I think when people think prefabs factory built they think well maybe it's not as good as what you could do my hand but that's not really the case here and and and I said you were to circle you meant to things that you did hear that were just fascinating to me\nThe foundation first she said oh you can make everything in the house but you can't make the foundation\nNow you guys actually got a foundation three hundred miles away and brought it here they bring\nIn ... well free cast foundation it's insulated it and it has a concrete reinforced steel reinforced studying it\nInsulated so there's no thermal breaking that in that position and the ... a free drilled for the electrician to run his wires and it's a fast efficient way to put a foundation and that's\nBasically what a booth at the same time\nWhile and the building that we're in right now this is actually the garage that it probably the nicest girl jak you've ever seen right but this was factory billed as well as well is\nThis a free kept building while you put it together everything caught on a on a CNC saw yeah so you know what's going to fit exactly right you know put the puzzle together and you've got a beautiful barn that looks like it was built on site\nNow the challenge on this property was building at the net zero which means that basically has to be so tight so well insulated and uh so perfectly heated um that essentially makes all the energy it needs to operate that involved a lot of different types of inflation or want to ask you about that because I I think it's unusual to see\nSpray foam used to different types of Springfield open and close close out and then you had sold ...\nIn which ah actually I Love that isolation I mean I think of it is it basically rock right funding to fight it molten rock and and and you it's a great insulation for sounded need for insulation and its water he says well you know if it gets wet it's going to dry out\nNow you guys use a technique called warmer blanket on the exterior walls what does that mean well\nThat's the way you take the insulation the disown\nWell that's right or you can also use rigid phone and you apply it to the exterior surface of the building so you framed the building in this case we had the old building we had to deal with the conventional wall right those was ... on the outside of the sheeting you have to put a thermal barrier\nBecause you have to worry about the thermal bridging of the structure when you when it meets that\nDifferent installations so in other words it could be some transfer of different temperature\nFrom the actual study and so you got to worry about condensation forming on the inside of the outside insulation\nIs that makes sense is that what it does enter the sandwich right so in other words you're putting something like a um it's it's ... like a house rats that you put on before you put your installation on is like a range Rangel if any any condensation should occur in between that insulation it will run down and not damaged she\nBut it's actually has to be completely storm only separated ... yeah yeah it's almost like when you're building sounded the buildings you put separate walls and never touch the same idea here which are firmly separating everything she hasn't she that insulation ... exactly right yeah that's the trick\nNow you also had to install solar right which is on this building and you also have a beautiful wouldn't

Rhode Island today\nI'm here with our friends from this old house they've invited\nMe to be a part of the final day of production here and James now\nAs a complete and really unusual house they take a one hundred euro seaside house that when it was originally built was probably never intended for anything other than summer residency they bolted on a brand new addition and they've made this entire structure so energy efficient\nIt's now known as a net zero house which means it's designed to greet the total amount of energy it needs to operate so coming up this hour we're going to get all the details on that project straight from the year which team including Kevin O'Connor Roger Cook Nora Ephron will be\nSo coming up this hour we're going to get all the details on that project straight from the Shia which team\nIncluding Kevin O'Connor Roger Cook plus norm ... will be by to talk about a very special miles so rich by very few programs because this is the forties season of this old house so let's get to it to get things off I'm very pleased to welcome a great friend of the money pit Kevin OConnor welcome Kevin\nAnd I mean that figuratively and literally because not only are you are now but you've been a friend too many homeowners now for many many years in your role as host and congratulations on the forty a season at this old house wow\nYeah season forty forty years it's something we're very proud of is you know I Can't take any credit for that I've only been doing it for the last Fifteen or the other boys are at twenty five years ahead of me on that but it's a testament to\nWhat norm Roger Richard in time he started back in Nineteen Seventy nine um that it's still going that is still popular that we're still doing beautiful buildings like this and we're taking it for a little bit of a victory lap are proud of it\nAbsolutely so tell me about this area of Jamestown now we're kind of right across the river from Newport which is famous for mansions and cliff walks is this where you moved if your name wasn't Vanderbilt [laughter]\nI'm not sure it's an island or I Am right in there again it sounds so\nTo the west of us at the mainland of Rhode Island and then to the east of us as you say is the peninsula of Newport we're all the mansions are all the sailing\nOr it's a smaller island community back in the day people had to take the ferry to go to school from ... to the mainland that we are now connected by bridges but it's always been sort of you know one step removed from the hubbub of Newport\nKind of a draft these small inefficient summer home to watch probably one of the most efficient homes in the areas and it's been expanded a lot so you need to figure out how to make space for all that in the landscape so tell me about that process I think a lot of our listeners maybe have never worked with a landscape architect mhm [noise]\nWell we uh we took a look at the lot and on a lot this guy is usually you try to use every square inch is a lot is usable Spain raised with the people that are here\nAnd ah so we\nWe took a look at the layout of the new house and try to relate spaces outside inside so there is a a kitchen backdoor entrance where they come and go most of the time that trash comes in and out we place to grill near the back door a there\nIs the barn a that they're in and out of and they do projects it's a it's a family of of of ah constructors right that's ... S C I definitely bills yeah\nSo we created a working yard off that garage in off the kitchen with a a with an old flat open space a little area of of paving little vegetable garden and there's a sliding door between the garage in this open space so it's kind of the overflow workspace\nSo and so it's kind of like I'm bringing the indoors out in the outdoors in addition airy space where just very comfortable moving from one zones and the next ... exactly that's where the design comes in in his ... from the design\nHow you've got to actually play in the physical elements actually perform what that intent is yes yes so\nWe gave them both are in an area of heart surfers in an area of grass a design defense of this come back we're all of this space put up a hedge between the house\nAnd the working yard which takes out some of the view of the mess that might be there in the back yard right out of the out of the kitchen windows ... uh and then there's also the circulation space in the back into the back back yard\nA which is a larger grassy area for their two young boys to get out and do what young boys do\nNo if folks are listening to this thinking you know what process show I\nGo through if I Want to improve my backyard space what kind of chips would you give them to kind of get them started well I Wish you mentioned before about relating the inside of the outside as vitally important okay so you can have a great space out saying that you can't get to it\nIt doesn't do a lot of good right [laughter] and and you want to go inside and look out all the windows you know because you're going to live in a in this New England\nWe live inside quite a lot of the time but a lot of views out the windows are just as important as the views of the house or the news in the open space and then to zone those different areas as they relate\nTo the house and then as they relate to the outside property lines we don't really think of the outside in the room splitting sensitive ... exactly the rooms and and the smaller the house the more useful those rooms are more important they are right\nIf you got a five acre lot you have a house in there it's usually in line and you know everything kinda bleeds out when you have a small house like this those outside edges become more to find\nAnd they become more inner grew into the living in the house\nSo all really important things to do keep in mind if you're you know if you just completed the summer and you're thinking about now is where I'm gonna start planning for next year you got about six or eight months now the ... windows you thinking about those faces\nYou're thinking about now is where I'm gonna start planning for next year you got about six or eight months now to start staring at those windows you thinking about those faces that and you know really living through your head\nNot maybe making the paper model of it I always just because people sometimes can't imagine the space shuttle sets up but now it's time to do that and that's great information's graduations and a well\nDone project here Tom Ryan landscape architect on this project thank you so much for stopping by the money had great thank you and you'll find this old house and asked us on the house on your local PBS stations plus more details and behind the scenes photos\nVisit this little house dot com or follow at this little house on Twitter and Facebook and hashtags ... wage Jamestown\nWell as you heard there are many many things about this home that are special and that includes the lawn there's actually a very unique type of earth called micro clover here with us to talk about that is this old house landscaping contractor Roger Cook\nAnd pat Hogan ... co walking guys welcome so\nThis is a house where the environment is really at the forefront and you've chosen a type of Turks here that is extremely sustainable and pretty much defines a environmental sensibility for for a landscaping let's talk about you call it micro clover what is\nThe micro clover is just what it is it's a covert but it's not like the Dutch clover right minimally flowering non colonizing clover okay that we've mixed in with a call to ask you mix\nAnd it's very trout tolerant the clover takes the atmosphere nitrogen converted into nitrogen grasp can use so you don't need to fertilize it\nRoger when it comes to fertilizing and getting the the one chemicals just write that something trips a lot of people up right\nWhere we spend a lot of time on our lawns trying to get 'em just right and usually it's in the past it's always been a bluegrass lawn right bluegrass lawn flew out of water and a lot of the evening and then you go to spray the weeds and bugs and everything else so this type\nOf ... you see a lot commercially is it unusual to put it in a residence\nWell we just started growing this in the past few years in right so it's something that's going on we see is the future is going to keep going ...\nHow does it stand up in terms of like wear and tear I mean this house has has two kids are growing up in it you know the top of that it's tough for that at the idea house a couple of weeks ago here for this old house so that quite a bit of traffic and cross that lawn and no I was back there last week with the professor from Penn State that is a research on this\nStuff look gorgeous he was a very happy to see so when you put\nDown a side Roger as opposed to you know growing one from scratch once the prep involved\nOr that I think it's the same as we've always been doing right we take what soil is here and we rotor Tiller scare by and losing it all All right so that the roots that are coming in can get down into a tank of themselves or get whatever moisture Zia then we find greed will ... will put in some lime if it needs it and then the seat is on [noise]\nNow we're in the midst of a parental rainstorm right now [laughter] I had to eat off his\nShoe irrigation today but does it take the same amount of water or less or more than with traditional long we'd get\nAnother one of the beautiful things about it it does not use a lot on the water and ... yeah we have to get in fact we have to educate people who are not\nWatering so much that's right yeah at the idea house I've already had to contact the irrigation contractor and say shut the water off enough [noise] so how can you add\nThis to an existing warning or do you always have to start construction was on a I think with the micro clover you can over seated into it but I Would say you wouldn't want to do it into a bluegrass lawn because that's not really a drought tolerant mental or more than a century right correct and that's just not gonna they're not going to get along right\nThose two types right yeah we've put it in with the tall fast you that's more drought tolerant\nAbout this is a harsh environment because it's right here on the coast I guess it's inappropriate products for a seaside community\nUh yes it is your last salts and all that it's actually more of salt resist been bluegrass is qualified I Love about\nThis old house I mean you know you learn things that you just wouldn't imagine really exist I mean the fact that there's this very specialized type of side that has all these benefits to it\nIs is so cool I'm In a while you guys\nThey'll always sort of pushing the envelope and coming up with this stuff

usefulness including what would have been probably the original wiring for one hundred your home type cold not into\nThe with us to talk about the safety of all that old wiring and what needs to be done with it as a lecture Russian Dan Giles welcome bent our you we're good thanks for stopping by the money that this is a interesting area lots of lots of history right here\nLots of old homes and would you agree that number two is probably the first ... than as these buildings\nYeah for sure that was the first modern type of wiring that could be afforded by your average person it wasn't as steel pipe installation or something that was highly labor intensive to install so it was pretty widely used in the early Nineteen hundreds as one of the first real residential methods of wiring\nNow interesting for those that are unfamiliar with not been too We're actually talking about real knobs and real to cheer when it was run through beans so you drill hole they look like a ceramic tube through it\nTo sort of inflate the wire from the wood and then when it went perils of the themes that would be strung on these ceramic knobs and it was essentially an air cooled system so air had to circulate around it\nBut then we decided we were going to eat these homes and insulation and what happens\nWell it eats up the other thing I think that happens to a lot and he's older homes as you know in the homes originally built designed they weren't designed for things like vacuum cleaners dishwashers air conditioners all these modern appliances that we have today\nAnd all those things these days are grounded a lot of the time so\nWhat you get is people kind of tagging new wiring on to the old system in unsafe way right\nAnd using it incorrectly a and again those systems were never intended to carry those kind of loads coupled with horror installation techniques of newer wiring and the and the increased loads of the homes it just creates some dangerous situations but the original installation the way that it was intended to be used was actually not a bad one writer who's fairly safe\nIt was it was the environment changed around it now for this house here in Jamestown did you find any existing nominate two that were still active\nOh yeah there were definitely most of the house had some now than to than it there were a lot of things tapped off of that knob and to just like I just said people trying to get something that they didn't have and make it work with the existing system [noise]\nUm so it was definitely a relatively dangerous situation in this house you know the things that definitely needed to be taken back to zero and start over\nTheir real education I understand that you spent quite a bit of time working with The Apprentice is for the season marriage missing and Kevin Barker how they do\nAll those guys are great I've actually known Kevin for quite a while he worked for another contract or that I subcontract too so Kevin I'm pretty familiar with he's a great guy could carpenter definitely learning a lot and and kind of progressing towards that skilled trades men type of\nPosition and Mary was just awesome you know really I only got to work with her a few times but she definitely had a great attitude willing to work hard wanted to learn loves what she does so those types of people are always fun to be around\nSo they were brought on this show basically as an example of what we eat in this country which in ... young people that are learning skilled trades do you think they were good ... for that mission\nOh for sure yeah you know they both love what they do they both loved to learn about what they do so that's a great start you know you can teach a lot of things but you can't teach work ethic our passion so those
