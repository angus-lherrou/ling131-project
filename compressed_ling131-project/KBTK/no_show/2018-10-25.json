I'm just not sure where to go [laughter]\nOkay and um so uh what do you make\nRight now I Am not working I recently moved back with family\nSo you're separated [laughter] okay and family is in Los Angeles yeah okay and um do you have children\nNow\nSo I'm I'm guessing based on that separation that the divorce was going ahead or not say it will be\nOkay right well whether you agree on filing for bankruptcy or not is irrelevant um he decides what he's going to do and you decide what you're going to do if you're not married\nAnd even if you are married technically because you don't file bankruptcy as a married couple um in other words when I filed I could have filed insurance not filed except that she had sons on the paper scissors you got to file too but um and we had to follow on all the different corporations mellow season that we had at the time that was Thirty years ago\nUm show a in this case he could file and you not file\nThat's possible whose whose name is the student loan in\nMine okay so that doesn't affect him anymore that's your eastern one either way whose name of the credit cards in\nBaltimore evenly are all or you're both on all of them were both on all of them\nWere he to file and you not to file you would be left last man standing and get to pay them\nOkay okay that's how that would work whose name was the car in Baltimore who's got the car\nThey're two different cars and we're both on them and he has one and I hear\nOh it's so twenty five is cars and where the breakdown of the twenty five break it out for me\nFifteen in ten ... okay\nThe rule on a an asset that has um\nThat has a lien against it is this you cannot get rid of the debt and keep the asset\nOkay so you could you could or he could file bankruptcy and you can clear off the credit card debt student loan debt is not bankrupt double it's not going away you got your student longer that's done okay the cars then you cannot keep the car unless you keep the debt\nYou can ... from the debt okay you're following me but that's the only way you keep the car and so sometimes people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh\nOkay you're following me but that's the only way you keep the car and so sometimes people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh I can just get rid of debt and that in the ... the debt off and they give me the car free and clear no that's not how it works is why they lean on the car\nOkay so they either get the car and wipe off whatever difference there is or was a I'm\nA ... or in the event of a bankruptcy you resign for the whole debt and you keep the guard so which of the cars is yours the Fifteen of the ten\nFifteen okay and what does that car worse do you have an idea\nI'd say about ten\nOkay All right and so you've got the ten thousand dollars in student loan debt you're going to get that either way no matter what happens here the Fifteen thousand dollars in credit card debt you understand if he files and you don't you've got that\nAnd then you got the other car now in the event of a divorce what I Would demand is that if he's going to keep a car that he refinancing and get your name off of it\nOr if he's filing bankruptcy um I guess he turns it in in the bankruptcy or gives it to you to sell or whatever the car the he's driving is it worth at least what's vote on it\nSay about that\nOkay so you could just sell that car and break even but I'm a you know if you can work that out in this deal so this is a mess is what it is and you already knew that okay yeah so the scenarios are\nThat um you know what will you be making what kind of an income do you think you'll land into\nUm veterinarian and so I Would say about Thirteen an hour and working fulltime\nAre you a D. V. M no\nOh no I'm attack your attack okay All right and so I'm\nIn that's in the Los Angeles area or you're going to somewhere else okay All right so you're going to land on that and then you're going to clean up your student loan debt and the credit card debt and the card that if he walks on all of it\nYup okay now if he chooses not to file and fight through it than the two of you got to work through this together and you're going to be what does he make\n[noise] ah last year he made about a twenty five\nOkay it coming out of the military\nIs telling his share in the military [laughter]\nYeah no no security clearance you understand that he understands and I'm sure you file bankruptcy or security clearance has gone\nSo his chances are moving up in the military are are are harmed pretty dramatically if he falls or bankruptcy but he didn't make any money should be in and he just came home of a deployment and he's lost his mind and I was like oh my goodness\nYeah [laughter] ... I'm so sorry I didn't care\nYou know he's just trying to start over and it's not going to be as easy for him as he wants it to be how old is he\nKinda haven't yeah okay\nWell um I I think you sit down with your pastor and if you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney to understand the things I'm Talking about that's fine um\nI I think if he files and you don't you've got to force him\nA to sell the car that is in his name and probably we're going to sell your ... to ... I'm In and get you get you a five thousand dollar loan for the difference and then you work your way out of the credit card debt the little bit of a car loan driving a beat her and the student loan debt is going to take you a little while with your income\nBut you can do that it doesn't mean you have to file just because he files mathematically or legally\nOkay this is just making sense to you here or there so I'm Sorry your face and all this mess listen if you get in the middle of and you're going to the question you call me back I'll help you okay thank you thank\nYou Chris is with us in Minneapolis Hi Chris how are you\nGood Dave how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nWith a question about life insurance or I'm not very uh ... uh I spoke with your guys Vander and uh\nYou know they had them kinda borderline whether or not I'd get a term life insurance [laughter] I've got a wife to kids at home and I'm the premium it'd be pretty expensive uh [noise] if I Do get approved so I guess my question is two parts [noise] and do I still go for it even if it's you know three\nFour hundred dollar a month premium um three or four hundred a month for how much coverage\nFor a ten times my my pay a million\nFor a million dollars okay ... what is your medical problem\nAh [laughter] basically ... to\n... you know that I get ya okay are you are you overweight\nYeah okay that'll give me too [laughter] yeah\nOkay yeah that they can help you more with the diabetes if you get the white down which also by the way up to the doctor already told you that you knew that right\nOh yeah I'm working on a good\nGood for you so hard struggle um\nSo what I might do is make sure my family's lot left with nothing and buy a smaller policy\nUntil we can do those two things and let let's get the weight off and get the diabetes more under control at that point and see if we can get a better rate two years from now or something\nHere and um you start to see the ... the actual economic value of taking care of yourself in those situations in addition to just oh I get to live longer hello you know so [laughter] you already knew these things right right um yeah\nUh but but I I mean what if you took half\nAnd at least you know she's are or how much do you own your home\nOf two eighty what does she does she work outside the home now she works out she was you know\nYou know so if you had like five hundred and that would pay off the house and put a couple of hundred in the pocket if something happened to you that's better than a half million it's not the proper amount but at least you could afford that [noise]\n\n\n\nYou're struggling with money relationships career you name it you're stuck and you don't know what to do\nI mean you know I ... and I've talked to him people will talk to him people dumped on him we love him all that but I Can't make him want to stop drinking he has to decide that right\nAnd it's really painful to watch people you love do stupid stuff to kill themselves you know I mean money wise or anything else so the only thing that I've had any success doing\nIs to possible approaches one is ask yourself if there's anyone that they look up to\nOn the subject of business or money it does he have a brother that he thinks is brilliant or do they have a friend or a pastor that they think is they trust their judgment and then try to get that person who does have credibility with them to speak into their life\nThat's a possibility the other possibility that probably will be more likely is for you not to say a word about their habits or their financial situation but every time you're around them tell your\nStory mhm mom we were short haired mom we were freaked out mom we were fighting about money all the time we were so overwhelmed I couldn't breathe\nManchester is getting tight and you know what we did was we got on this budget and we cut up our credit cards and we're not there yet and man I feel so much better and I'm On the way and no one can argue with you about your story and your feelings\nRight but don't Wagner finger at her and say no you need to do this to instead of just just keep talking about what's happened in your life what's what happened with you ... what's your deal and eventually they're going to say something like well I Wish I could do that\nWill you know it'd be nice it'd be nice to get control when they got to do that Debbie Downer right or party thing right the martyr thing now and people do that all the time and and as soon as I Do that that's your opening jump in and go I think you can\nI really think because I felt the same way I didn't think I could do it but I think you really can't I think you can have\nIt when it was found dead if they do at\nThe union so you're already you already jumped on the front lawn you got slammed down\nAs you start saying that and that conversation she gonna shut you down you know\nThey are and all you got to do just talk about what if you did for you are or not\nFor her job and get about\nEnabling like with your alcoholics friend obviously you wouldn't know allow for and drink\nAnd John Barr knowing what I get married without giving money to drink\nRight and my parents they're basically eating out ten dash ... times a day for ... my dad just retired and they only have one income that are living on two incomes you know\nAnd and so when we made that they don't live in our and our state and so we go visit them and my dad he wants to take us out to the fancy dinner to show that he loved that and we love handles so much but I just want to scream absolutely not not participating in that I don't want to train our relationship\nWell it just said that you know what we're learning in our story as we're learning that we can't do that and so it makes us very uncomfortable to do that with you so let's find another way to celebrate our time at home because we don't want to go out to eat it won't be fun for us\nBut don't go that you only take us out to eat or to broke that stupid\nIf you want to say that that's what you're thinking and I'm thinking yeah right I agree with you but if you say that kind of stuff so you got to direct it all back to you back to you back to you back to you talk about how you feel about this not about how you feel about them or their behaviors but\nYou're just back and talk about you used to feel the way and you turn it loose you used to feel and now I feel good I used to be freaked out now I'm not in you know of course it only to be the truth by the way and you know tell the truth and\nYou know but I used to I I felt that way too personally I mean I went broke Shannon I went ... we've got killed each other I Know how it feels to fight\nAbout money and um we'll fight about money anymore and have it in years\nUh and so how do you how do you fix that what do you do and you're just share your story talk about your story and they will start chasing you eventually to get that and go if if they ever reach out and say well we should look into that hey I can show you how if you want me to tell you what we're doing\nBut don't ever turning go deep one step deeper and go because you're stupid\nBecause you're doing this wrong you go out to eat all the time you got to stop that don't turn into the instructor\nBecause the instructor or you're you're not in a position to be the instructor all you can do is lead them if you want to go to ... my my pay for it 'cause it changed my life not because you're so stupid you need it\nYou see the difference and you just keep directing it back through you through your story that your only shot and just talk about what it's done for you not what it'll do for them and then pay for it pay for it\nFor them to go through and I'm\nSorry mom someday when you're rich you can pay for the rest of the kids to go through or something if you want the right now under this is my gift 'cause when it's done for me and you know might not work for you but it's worked for me you know I just kind of keep playing it off and making them chase it a little bits of begging them to be smart\nHope that helps you open phones a AAA eight to five\nFive

I've never heard of that\nAt George when I saw that and I saw that in my Bible I nearly fell off of my chair I spent three years in Syria biblical studies\nI Know the scriptures and when I saw that I'm telling you right now I couldn't reconcile that I just couldn't believe what I was seeing and there it is and\nI'm telling you right now I couldn't reconcile that I just couldn't believe what I was seeing and there it is and again don't take my word for it if if you're out there listening I get a hold of a King James Bible or punch it up on line and you'll see for yourself\nYou if you go and look at your own Bible a hundred and fifty seven year old one yeah we'll we'll let's say the wolves\nAbsolutely and I've taken pictures of it and it's there that is ... ... ... it is bizarre George it's I have no actually the only explanation and I still don't understand that I have it in the in the new book the only\nThing that I can take over this\nPerhaps this is linked to CERN which is the Large Hadron collider and\nThe ... was French boy yes\nThe work they're doing I Believe they're opening up portals she dimensional doorways\nI mean I I remember as a kid the lion lays down with the lamb\nYes then if you can get Tom on TV or somebody to watch out for you and show you on screen what I'm saying and you'll see for yourself and it's shocking it's really shocking to see it because anybody\nWho has heard that scripture you know it by heart it's one of the most popular scripture than the entire Bible and now it says ...\nCan you find in anywhere where it says the lion least down with the lamb or is it just is it the wolf all over the place\nIt is the wall fit every Bible now however\nA friend of mine uh he has a YouTube channel ah ah his name is Chris and I thank you very much for finding this for me he actually found him and his YouTube channel is become one that could see\nHe actually found something for me out like older encyclopedia biblical encyclopedia and he found the passage with the lion and the ... that is the only place\nThat you will see it as something and it will be in my new book stranger than fiction\n[noise] and that's it everything else George says low wolf\nI Wonder if it's going to change if he does it look at it every day for example if one day it's going to change to the wolf some\nOh it wouldn't surprise me one bit and furthermore the Lord's Prayer is now change\nHappened last okay but the Lord's Prayer is our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name I Can't comment there will be done on earth as it doesn't happen give us this they're rather forgive us for trust passes\nAs we forgive those who trust pouch against us and leaders not into temptation the risk from evil for the ... that came into power and the glory forever more right you've heard that a million\nDollars of Kobe it's changed now so now with our father which are an Adam and I never heard it like that yep how that came to come I Will be done in or\nIn or near where we have in earth now you live in or the is there some\nThing that changes the things\nYes and I do believe without really knowing the answer and even if I saw it in front of my face I don't know I wouldn't know what I was looking at\nA but I Do believe that it is CERN and these the wave quantum computers that are working in concert and I think that it's earned that opens up the portal and see the way computers\nSomehow some way whether it is some way as crazy as all the sounds I assure you it's true that they have this ability to go back whether it's going back in time and changing this\nI don't know but I can assure you of this for anyone out there who would say oh well\nThis is just the Bible's that are you know they make these changes coming off the printing presses and all that I'm Sorry I'm Talking about a hundred and fifty seven year old Bible that has changes in at a Bible that's been in my possession for years\nThat has changes in it now so that can't be resolved we be in human understanding we can't resolve that and another thing that I find very interesting\nIs that the Lord's Prayer I have it on paper and a frame on my wall that was changed to what I just told you are but yeah\nI have the Lord's Prayer carved in a stone in my home and that is not changed and it has not been changed so it's interesting to note that what ever this technology is\nApparently it cannot make changes on something that is in stone\nWar of some type of metallic substance or something like that another bizarre thing George or do you have any Roman numeral clocks in your home or do you have a watch with Roman numerals\nYeah I think I Do I think I have a couple of watches what that\nOkay well I Want you to look at this a Roman numeral Nichols turned upside down\n... what is what has happened to them\nThat this effect has now turned them opposite so they're upside down now so where you would see a in the five o'clock position you know that would look like a of V.\nThat's now turned upside down to where it looks like in a weird\nAnd again for anyone who thinks that this is crazy talk just look at your watch isn't your clocks and and and another ... and I've taken photographs of this as well and people from all over the world are noticing this\nAnd other interesting thing\nI have some watches with Roman numerals that have been affected and changed yet I have a clock a Roman numeral clock on my wall in my living room that have like metal hands for the Roman numerals and that has not been changed\n... you know we're going to have our ins to pull back on our website as we get some new software and I'll be able to pull people instantly bill and I would love to pull people on the lion lease down with lamb and see how many people say that they agree that's what it was\nAnd then compare it to the statistics are yeah I've been in so overwhelming people would say that it then it was a little lion lays down with the lamb\nNo question about it I mean the wolf is ridiculous it doesn't fit there's no way when you say that it just it makes no sense\nGeorge when you look at it it just looks so odd it's not right now let me ask you this ... D E hey you're familiar with the da\n... administration\nWell it's interesting that you say that because it was known as the drug enforcement agency that's why they were ... agents and now it is the drug Enforcement Administration\nWow why ... see I've always thought of it is that we're gonna come back with more built in a moment coast to coast am your phone calls with Bill being big foot and the Mandela back\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it sinks or not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet\nWouldn't it be great if there was a seats that had to look I'm a beautiful antique so you could display it in your living space as an heirloom while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino iron works shakes and rhino safe dot com\nAmerican Made an antique styled our seats are part art part furniture and all security\nAnd if you like the classic look of our rhino hire more safe we also feature beautiful matching tool chess and furniture with hundreds of thousands of satisfied customers and a huge network\nAcross the U.S we've built our reputation on having the best bill best looking and most convenience sake what's great service and warranties and you can get online financing so go what's the best\nAnd get style convenience security and true peace of mind with rhino safe dot com today not sure I Know save dot com rhino safe dot com\nPastor men into when Sunday mornings at eight Ninety seven boy was the big dogs are more stimulating talk their retirement road map show with ... for a weekend at\nNight and looking back in college none of us will gain being as we talk about big food the Mandela Effect in your ... says well bill with this fall under the Mandela sect category of the actor jak collapse\nPeople thought he had died he's dead now but during his day when he was very much alive everybody thought he was dead everybody you talk to his would that be part of the Mandela sacked\nI tell you that George I would\nVenture to say yes I mean it's not just jak Polanski uh the Reverend Billy Graham\nAh Nelson Mandela that's how that's you know what the name came from Jim Neighbors and various other um stars like this or politicians or that or or you know people that are Reverend um [noise]\nSomehow we all had it wrong and thought these people had a dry years ago and you know a lot of those folks that died in more recent years here and are there are people swear\nThat they remember funerals for Billy Graham and televised specials and things of that nature and it's mind boggling\nAnd and [noise] really interesting that\nI could say is that the devil\nIs a master of confusion and division so we're there is confusion there is division because if I say to you well George I think it used to say this or whatever and you're going to no no no it's always said that now we have confusion\nAnd division is going to come in and I really believe that\nThe source of this is demonic in nature and this is Jay can't pick this in my opinion is part of the strong delusion and the great perception that has come on the earth I've had to pay\n... Bible scholars on other shows about this topic and they swear\nThat none of the scriptures have been changed it always said the wall fan all these other things that I'm an agent for the devil for saying this and it it's mind boggling George and anybody that knows me and you know me well enough\nGod is first in my life I Am an agent for God I go all over this country helping people to be free from demonic garbage but yet\nThere were people are in debates against they on things like this that just said no way you know you're twisting the scriptures around and nothing could be further from the truth what\nDid they say the devils greatest trick is making people convinced that he doesn't exist\nYes absolutely and it's a tell you this is where we really have to [noise] and and I am poor people out there here what I'm saying are now is the time\nTo really get closer to God and ask God for discernment to know what is right and what is wrong with his true it is not who is true who is not\nBecause we are in an age of deception and it is only by the power of God and the guidance of God and the protection of God that we're going to get through the things that are here and the things that are coming\nIt's actually kinda scary that so many people the great majority believes\nIn one thing and then there it is clearly in black and white something else and we swear up and down that they can be\nYeah it's incredible it's mind boggling it truly is and more people are free to believe what they want it's not my job to try and put somebody's arm into believing something but it is my job by the power of God as a matter of God to speak truth\nAnd when something like this comes along I Can't remain silent on it because I feel I have an obligation to people that tell the truth and as disturbing as this is I'm Sorry it's the truth that people need to get ready and prepare for this\nAnd as disturbing as it is I'm Sorry it's the truth and people need to get ready and prepared for this\nLet's start with the bones drove truck driving in Indiana they're going to start an age oh go ahead\nGeorge me good thank you this myth\nThat stuff is free ... ... ... you know\nLike I remember it is still the land myself too so I I don't know it's kind of ...\nBut ah as far as that goes I think that's a fact of the actual like cereal world not just like the floats there's a couple of famous movie Lawrence of her life change from what I've heard some song lines\nAnd like scripture and stuff like that but like there's a ... there's a tree over close to my house there the other like the family or any of the people who live there ever been there and all of a sudden there's this fact\nKidding [laughter] that's funny\nOh as part of the cars are so I just wanted a pop up there are\nAlready thinking would that be part of a Mandela Effect where everybody doesn't even recognize the tree and it's their\nGeorge there are people that are reporting stuff like that that they're seeing a you know things that were never there before that are there they are seeing\nI'll give you another example for breeze you know that that the air freshener for breeze yes how would you spell that\nI'm a I'm just guessing but it's I Would have said after E.

George Jim\nThe first board that we have a we have an understanding that because we have history of it we have documents that talk about it is a board it's Eighteen eighty six known as the which board now we know this board existed and was made by a company called the ws read toy company\nAnd George the cool thing about this is it's really interesting history\nThe people who manufactures this board\nSent a letter along with the board to president Grover Cleveland force for for his wedding gift and this I Know and we know this because they took the opportunity to send that vaccine letter over to the Boston Globe who got published I mean there are masters of PR yeah now what do you think president Cleveland did\nWell I Would guess she checked the board\n[laughter] well listen as we said the letter comes to him and it says honored sir we take the liberty city by expressed today an article of her own manufacture which is attracting a great deal of attention called the which board\nPresident Cleveland kindly wrote back and said I knowledge with thanks the which board which he sent me as a wedding present I accept it as an evidence of kind ceiling and friendship and can a moderate fourth ingenuity but hardly think that I shall neatly test its powers to disclose the path and forecast the\nFuture when he did take it or knew he was he took it he took it I Would leave censored back\nWell there's no there's no history of that now we don't know where that board is but let's just tell you what happened fast forward a few years fast forward for years and they are now Eighteen Ninety and a group of businessmen and one businesswoman got together and came up with their own board version of it and they got it named\nAnd they want to talk about this woman here her name as miss Helen Peters not for the\nAnd they consider her a gift tax psychic and she sat at the board and the message came through and it said they asked what should we call you wish we call this tool is for this device it's spelled\nOut we job they they decided let's go we just so\n... so they needed to get it patented so in Eighteen Ninety they went to the U.S\nPatent and trademark office allies are bon the attorney for this group went along with miss Helen Peters they sat down at the board because they had to prove\nTo the patent officers that this tool works everybody kept saying no I'm not going to do this no I'm not going to register is not this uh this is ridiculous finally the head guy came out and said okay you don't know me I don't know you if that thing there can spell out my name\nIs George what do you think happened it's all the others and sure enough in the ... came alive\nNo didn't spend a lot of his name with somebody on the plane ship where he probably would've accused him of doing something or did it work by itself\nYou know you got to have a plan Shen after that yeah you\nHave to so it started out they didn't know him and it was that you know that's how the story goes so\nThis woman miss Helen Peters not worth the ah is really critical of crucial to the naming of the board and also to get a patent said and a lot of people didn't know about her till about six years ago when Robert merge the chairman of the board of the talking about ... dug up an old archives\nOh about her till about six years ago when Robert merge the chairman of the board of the talking about ... dug up an old archives\nStories and letters about her and so it's it we were honoring her just last month and as the uh Denver, Colorado and gave her beautiful gravestone with everybody everybody's and that was hard at are buried in her plot their names are on it\nUm she was just on her she was just lost to history but we resurrected her and her family was so grateful and thankful and and now she's got to be well no and she's going to go on the heritage a group of people who do tours in his grave yard is called the Fairmont\nCemetery in Denver, Colorado and she's going to be remembered and recognized for her contribution to this device forever\nHow do you explain to somebody called on the show a couple of years ago and talked about how\nTo get rid of all we gee

Do he said well if you talk to me I can leave my\nBody and I can come visit you tell one night me and my girlfriend her baby my brother and sister and after they went so that we decided to try it and it was really calm quiet night it was warm and the windows open the front or a phone you know it was early eighties we really nothing to be afraid of mhm\n[noise] and we're trying to talk to him next thing we know\nWe heard aware noise and the front door the screen door open and\nYou talk to him next thing we know we heard a weird noise in the front door the screen door open\nAnd there was one way and open so we jumped up and when the when the doors are locked and just started shutting all the windows because we're like oh my gosh somebody tried to come in\nWell the next day he called me cause for good behavior he was allowed to make calls so he called me and he says why just shut the door on me so what are you talking about he gives you tried to talk to me last night I came home and shut and all around me I said I get ready to read\nYou look at things Angie grudge\nUn gee that's a I I Love when she shared it and what I've learned about the border over the years is\nThat you don't you can talk to people's higher sales you can talk to people that are still alive you can talk to animals that are alive or deceased so it's an it's what it is it's really you're you're communicating with their consciousness you communicate with that part of the cells that exist like the higher self that exist beyond their corporate ... existence or experience\nAnd so you start to have these other dimensions of a person so I don't one bit doubt that you can do that as I have done that myself\nAnd that one didn't have a real bad end to it\nYou know and I think she just\nPut yourself because it is kind of weird at first we start doing this and you go how can I talk to that person is still alive isn't a board to be used with the deceased person will no I learned that this board can become your costs make the phone I I use it as a cosmic phone like I Would have wireless phone dialing the frequency through my intentions\nThrough my thoughts through my feelings and then I can tap into

I'd like to disagree with your book which is great for you know what do you say that\nWas coming out of the board it's things that are coming out of you and you but I really can't buy that because you're talking about ...\nPeople who never met this man right we'll give you the board and the more shoulders man these people have no idea who it was really there was more jobs being coming through the board in may on\nBefore they ever got there and you know were warned not to have\nCommunication with spirit because it is that people will want and the living will they will die but did not anything I really believe that you're going to find them and you've been with the spirit and they will continue to do that\nGo ahead and journalists react to this thanks Jean\nYeah thank you Jane I'm so listen when I'm Talking about abilities\nWe all have a six sensibility we have ability to be intuitive and path to gut feelings your heart feeling we'll talk about your guy or you had you had sneaking suspicion something was right or wrong\nThat's the abilities and how that turns out and humans life we often have will have dreams of prophecy will have I'm sort of like something just doesn't feel right here or gosh I've known the person for years\nIt's do things I'm Talking about when I was born people use the board on this level of using the word you're able to bring out your own six sensibilities\nSo these people using the tools were able to tap into that whether it's their idiot motor using or subconscious mind which includes\nAbilities of psychic abilities or medium chef or um even just tapping into just your your knowing this\nOr they connect with the spirit now I'll I'll just a second part of that he talked about you were told not to do this often told not to do things that will keep us in control and keep us down and so what I found is we are told you have to have an intermediary to talk to spirit you have to meet in a merry intermediary to talk\nTo God and I find that I have a direct connection to all these beans which has been nothing but loving and beautiful so with all due respect you and I disagree with you but I think we both can have an opinion because

listens to me now and\nHe heard me talking about Neil Armstrong and the movie first man which I went to see last weekend and I talked about it on Monday and I said I didn't like it it wasn't comforting because the characters of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were not particularly likeable\nSo he sent me a note telling me of a story that I probably might have remembered I vaguely remember it has the story of when a Neil Armstrong came to Cincinnati and this was a good deal I think it was a ... well after I had left Cincinnati in Ninety One\nUh apparently what a puzzle ... who is a a University of Cincinnati engineering professor I came from that area I think originally and had now at that point in time he became the spokesperson for Chrysler\nSo he came into the Cincinnati auto inspection facility and he did a little public service thing reminding people to get their cars inspected that sort of thing it's me or not the greatest story in the planet\nBut a lot of people like me and this fellow or space geeks and he ... he said this to me because I knew I was a space geek is well\nAh he arrived at the inspection facility with a couple of other reporters to do the interview with Neil Armstrong and so they did the obligatory interview\nA and then when he was all done he went over and shook everybody's hand ah and the car hadn't been finished yet so for twenty minutes they they all stood around and talked\nAbout space program but Neil Armstrong family you want to know about their family or this guy by the way had also been in Dayton and Cincinnati the fellow I'm Talking about\nAnd um he now teaches I think in a broadcasting school or in some university if I'm not mistaken anyway he said that in person Armstrong was so very friendly it was like talking with your next door neighbor over the fence he was quiet\nBut his incredible intellect was obvious\nAnd so he's told the story to his children grandchildren and so forth meeting Neil Armstrong and I I did not ever meeting you know I met Buzz Aldrin on a couple of occasions I thought he was the ...\nSort of but uh in terms of\nI'm Sorry I just didn't know what the movie portrayed him as the it portrayed him as intellectually a strong and as smart guys thinker cetera et cetera et cetera but it didn't he didn't come across as being likeable at least I didn't think he did so I was glad to have a this input\nFrom my friend Kevin in Cincinnati thank you another way of looking at are considering and there always are\nAs we talked there's always two ways of listening or learning about a an item or a

with a big ridiculous looking digital timer tapes to it\nAgain this is not something you go on the Internet it never shows you to build a bomb this way\nAll the wires and the detonator usually concealed inside the pipe I don't know goes through an X ray machine just see a big metal pipe probably is not going to make it to whoever it is you're sending unless you're sending it to their home\nYesterday was this was a sign of how advanced and serious the situation but there was a level of sophistication levels for Asian\nBecause he had vent or she by the way he or she had white uh send 'em some of these bombs to home offices and and read that in ... where there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional uh mail service which would definitely be\nThrilled to tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out and her bathrobe and are fuzzy slippers with a cigarette hanging from [laughter] get the paper in the mail every day when she gets up\nWhose home did it go to that they didn't have a screened in ... both of them have private security course or ... or service after her right\nThey get older male ... you have private security you know get your money don't like we never opened our mailbox I remember\nOne time my kids went to open the mailbox I said do not open the mailbox don't open the mailbox\nGary ... who who are those people referring to read I mean I don't know all the address again like it was just the coverage and that was one of their they were saying that this was I guess they'd be Wasserman Schultz ah they send it\nAnd now she is I mean she's not even in Congress anymore right so ah but she they sent her to the office or that it was sent back to her office they said was one that would maybe not have screening I don't I didn't I didn't fact check their claim but that was\nWhat they were attempting to ah to pass off of the fence occasion I I've never built a bomb\nNo one don't intend to in my life um but it\nWould you say it or that you would make it plastic to get past screening because we put a big metal pipe it's going to be more obvious right if you did it if you did it to get\nPast screening that's good but that shows that you have no idea what you're even do you're not even but you're you're there you have a very low IQ\nOr your uh or your ... you know a a a young kid that just thought it was funny uh I I don't even know but the shows that you do not understand why a pipe bomb is\nDestroying the answer is no a plastic PVC pipe bomb it will ... it'll still be detected because and that's why he had the in my opinion that's why you had the wires and the big ridiculous basically equivalent alarm clock tasted a stupid thing because like you you you've seen like at the airport like sometimes you're like hey maybe I can slip in the bottle of water you know like ...\nYou know like if there's no slipping this past the screening right like that ... that I think to the other to think\nThat back this up are one or you made it in in a way that was so none of them blew up right like yeah you know what I'm saying ten bombs around the country none of them explode right like so it seems to be that maybe you didn't want them to expose possibly the other part is why do you put a sticker\nWith a mean on they're getting less it's not going to explode\nIf people are gonna be able to write and I want to get into that and I also want to ask the question\nWhy do you put a sticker with a mean on their jobs\nAnd less it's not going to explore that people are gonna be able to write and I want to get into that and I also and I asked the question why would you put an alarm clock on it in the mail if you don't know when it's going up you don't know why is there a clock on this that yeah so we get to that in just a second [noise]\nTell you about simply safe I'm simply safe is the way to keep

talk\nFor the land back\nI Love this I just love this\nUh the the headline on CNN Trump a Trump I'm\nA mocks media as explosives investigated well\nWait ... you guys were blaming Trump and mocking Trump yesterday before all of the bombs were even found\nYour blaming it on him without CNN is it's really irresponsible he has gone over ... they worked a target of it and when you're in the middle of it sometimes you don't make rational decisions you know that's no excuse for soccer is not for someone who's running a news organization ... he wrote\nA there's a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of the continued attacks on the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand there was words matter that's far they have shown no comprehension of that\nThat is that I think it's a fair criticism at times and we made it um I don't like everything that he says about the media but we have no evidence no evidence at all the rhetoric or anything else fed into these bombings we have no idea\nWe have no idea who did them we have no idea what the motivation was yet I mean I think you could probably say there's a\nPolitical motive but that's a good ... political motive but that's all you could say you don't know it is such these\nBombs are so ridiculous that it was either done by somebody who is mentally inefficient or\nIt's somebody who didn't want the bombs to go off yeah the sticker the ISIS me ... right\nEither done that clearly marks that as somebody from the right\nWhy would you put that on there\nAnd why did none of them go off right I mean again you hope God I'm Glad none of them went off by the way um but it it seems to indicate someone who one of these things to be seen every single part of this that we just talked about a no leads to that\nThe rights and Donald Trump for this look I I don't we first of all you can't blame a Donald Trump for the ... unless you think he actually was responsible does anyone think that he actually sent the bombs and brought them to George Soros is\nHow well no but I think of ... [laughter] unless you think he's actually responsible irresponsible for your own actions\nWe know that but beyond that if you're gonna ... you have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election\nRight or less than two weeks at least ... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by the hatred of Donald Trump there's an obvious incentive to make America you will that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs go off\nIt's certainly possible but they are acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's fault you do not have to be Alex Jones to look at this with some skeptical lie\nYou not to say that you know\nThat that ... that it's a it's a year since we're proving anything but you have to at least keep your mind open to the idea that there are not jobs on both sides would crazy motivation in a intense time look what they did the freaking capping off people saying he was a gang rape is to stop it\nHere's here's the amazing thing do you remember the time\nRight after nine eleven for the first few years when something would be saying something would happen and we would hope\nThat it was somebody from the middle east remember that ... where we didn't want\nIt to be an American no matter which side they were on we didn't want that to happen now we just our dog piling on its them it's them whichever them if you ... you know helps your political position it's them\nWe we don't even consider anything else we don't even consider that modern oh maybe the Russians are involved maybe this is just\nA an outside influence no probably not now but we're not even considering it we have zero evidence of anything\nAnd everyone is the media is just condemning the right you have no evidence and I guarantee you if they find this guy and he is\nMentally disturbed and has no real understanding of anything that he is doing or she's left you will not hear that\nThey will change the narrative immediately to well it is kind of thing happens it happens all the time and it could happen where it where it didn't go off and it could happen where it is a right wing extremists they'll just change the narrative it won't slow them down at all what\nDid you think what what's the part of this that are that great getting your attention but well the first of all the fact that none of them have gone off yeah and\nThe list of the people involved too is pretty stereotypical I wing target I have you know this bomber\n... code name Wylie coyote [laughter] the only thing he didn't do is leave a plate of bird seed next to it and yeah I mean it's so obvious it's cartoonish to start with George Soros\nA and to include Robert De Niro and all\nOf these Maxine ... scene waters all of a typical blaze it's just too can be it's too much for ... they don't go off\nAnd it's that perfect list of the people that the right really doesn't like that\nAgain is it hard to live it is it's a cartoon list it is\nNow ... so we could do this don't don't get me wrong and I think you're probably saying this to it could be it couldn't be left or right wing or it could be a right wing ... we have no idea if it is a right wing person\nThey live in a cartoon world yeah they're ... they're ridiculous they they they're so in that that they can't make them but they don't even understand why you wouldn't use plastic for a pipe bomb that that much to CNN's chagrin when\nThey said yesterday well shows the level of sophistication\nTacit ... here none of them went off in like there's no if you can't get one of the tend to go off what level of sophistication you have a bright low and it's so cartoonish there's no level of sophistication\nI I like this can you guys helped me figure out the needle CNN is attempting to thread here\nThey write this is a from Brian filters newsletter she's most of the recipients were prominent Democrats or as a ... a Washington Post simply put it amid incendiary rhetoric targets of Trump's words become targets of bombs\nThat not the same as blaming Trump weight\nLike many people on TV on Wednesday I specifically said I wasn't blaming Trump for the crimes of a madman shut news industry executives have repeatedly warned that Trump's reckless attacks against the media are having\nWorld consequences yet none of them Maxine Waters words are having any kind of consequences or they none of those no well Boeing is aren't mobs these are not mob nutty\nMaxine Waters words are having any kind of consequences or they none of those no well bill and these aren't mobs these are not mob now these are just people gathering together\nWho are very passionate about what they believe it I don't even want you to the word ma call it the more and how dare you even say ... to ... is a problem and I was not a problem\nIf reckless that we're talking about a bombing reckless attacks against the media are having real world consequences what are the real world consequences you're talking about\nAre on the day of my farm showing up in the middle of a paragraph about the bombing and how harsh rhetoric can lead to bombings here saying you're not blaming him but you're also pointing out that these\nWords have real world consequences like I of course you're blaming him just come out of the MIT it just come out and it made it yes we think you guys are bringing\nDavid ... a op ed piece or the piece in slate I saw where they were on yeah oh it is beautiful I we gotta get David Klinger on David ... is a guy who I don't know invented the cursor or

opening of the package well there's been several open and none of them have ... data which tells me\nThere is some sort of problems so I Hope it they're not real um and I hope that the the authorities find them sooner than later I think\n... search go because they have so much now forensic evidence here I'm assuming you know we we talked about this yesterday that it was none of this is easy but I'm I'm assuming by now they probably have their eyes on somebody\nAbsolutely absolute by said yesterday you all have you know probably twenty four to Seventy two hours uh and and I stand by that they're sitting at Nord ... much of an enormous amount of evidence\nThat they've been able to capture because these things to knock that day and I think we'll see something so All right\nDr ... the last word today\nThe bottom line is we run these people to ground we released the plot how we throw the book of them but it doesn't matter what side you're on\nThe the responsibility for the normalization of violence\nAs started on the left when you have a former attorney general who worked for President Obama say when they doubt you kick them when you have Hillary Clinton say we're going to be civil off the we win the election nobody on the rise says that it's a left responsibility for the normal I finished\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell ya I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment\nThere couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and the more people are hearing about that the better off we are and I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate\nAnd so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because\nIt's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today uh I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with him when it town so you know I don't like to count on naming of post offices a procedural vote\nI don't know how well let's talk about the votes where he Donald Trump really could have you on his boat health care being one\nWell that's right so Joe mansion said no to getting rid of Obamacare and having a really high quality affordable health care options in the mountains state\nSean in West Virginia premiums have risen over a hundred and sixty percent in four years and mansion said no to fixing getting rid of Obamacare\nAnd I think that West Virginians didn't like that they also didn't like the fact that Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts that are really giving a big left to our state providing economic opportunity better jobs\nJoe mansion have to side with Chuck Schumer the leadership on every issue when it matters mansion says no and even on ...\nWhere people say oh was he ended up voting for Kavanaugh the reality is he waited he actually left the Senate a voting chamber and waited for Susan Collins cast a vote and then and only then to Joe Manchin step out because he knew if he didn't do that he was politically death\nIs so so I you know I kind of used a lot of those votes as you know election conversion your votes and that's the point is you don't vote for the tax cuts um and you know maybe not as extreme as as everyone else in his party but the reality is is that he's going to vote for Chuck Schumer to be the majority leader\nAnd I don't think Chuck Schumer can get ... votes in West Virginia which makes mansion out of touch with the people in West Virginia and it was important issues like tax cuts regulation energy those are three main fundamental issues that that affect an impact\nThe economy in West Virginia also I Know West Virginia like a lot of places have struggled with the oil opioid issues and we'd have one with the president did yesterday and what he's been doing since he became president\nWell that's one of the big issues in this race that Joanne since first vote will be for Chuck Schumer and Chuck Schumer has made no bones about the fact that he's going to head out\nThe obstruction resistance impeachment caucus and if you're part of that Schumer leadership team and Joe Manchin is and you're powering these liberals the folks that really created all the rock destroying the Kavanaugh hearings\nThen you're part of the problem so that's why people were so focused on Joe mansion first vote because the you know he's not going to be with West Virginia and he's going to be part of a team that's tearing down the president West Virginians don't want that and that's why we're gaining so much momentum in our campaign\nHow much money is the Democratic party putting into West Virginia to try and keep it otherwise how much is Schumer in company and below sea and company or are they investing in the negative ads about you\nWell they've put a fortune and I think by a well by all accounts they are going to probably be up over twenty four twenty five million dollars and this is West Virginia this is not New York California or Florida they'll probably end up spending about ... million more we're going to look at the final ...\nAnd that's what happens on you mentioned earlier you know if you get pounded for months on end of that and you can't respond it makes it difficult but now the president came back twice he's actually our side we think is going to come back again and we start to come back twelve ten eight six to for that to you know to even\nAnd that's because President Trump has made this a top priority\nWhen does early voting began in West Virginia as it started your\nEarly yeah early voting started yesterday and so we're starting to look at the numbers one thing we see is that the Republicans have a lot of energy and people know that the future of the Senate could really be at stake\nWhat this election and that there's a clear choice so uh we're feeling good about it we're not hockey but we're going out worked Joe mansion and people are gonna know on the conservative fighter will help the President Joe mansion he's a dishonest Washington liberal and he's never there when you need them\nRight we're watching the race now put this in the ... column\nIs it dishonest washing their liberal and he's never there when you need them\nAll right we're watching the race now put this in the ... column a where we once thought it was a leaning Democrat now the state of West Virginia and play attorney general Patrick Morrisey would support the president's agenda versus Joe Manchin sadly would vote for Chuck Schumer said\nAnyway it's a race at this point and uh with early voting a there is a very good shot that that could change hands that would help\nA future endeavors in the U.S Senate and we wish all the best Patrick Marcy\nHey Shaun thanks so much for anyone interested in learning about a ... you

Claire McCaskill's husband and allegations made against him a when he was married to his first wife I mean if that's the standard none of the mass for the Clintons to have this Bill Clinton to go through the same thing the judge Kavanaugh went through they praise him to the hilt\nAnd we've got the same thing here I could literally spend an hour on this program playing the incendiary violence statements of those on the left that the media routinely ignored\nAnd the hatred all ... minute by minute second by second hour after hour day after day Trump hatred twenty four seven which is now that it's a it's it's a psychotic pathology on the part of those in the news media they didn't care about that either\nI'm very clear you know I don't think the capitals standard should be applied in in the case I Believe in due process still for even Allison\nFor Spartacus work insisted on this program this Russia collusion Hillary Clinton pain for Russian lies we need to know about it\nAnd in this case people making threats of violence against the president or against any Democrat oh I'm the one that said uh investigate it was built when Brock Obama was president and I'm the one that electorate how we need to keep our presidents safe and secure\nWhen these police were shot on that ball fields and we found out it was a Bernie Sanders supporter I said I'm not blaming Bernie Sanders for what one of his supporters ... does not Bernie Sanders fault\nAnd you don't see the same recognition by anybody on the left you just wanna hyper politicize anything they can any minute of any data to bludgeon Donald Trump politically\nAnyway Danielle McLaughlin is with us as well as Jonathan Gillum welcome both of you to the program and uh how many more weeks we're going to have another little baby Danielle McLaughlin\nHow many weeks I'm Hi guys you know about that two weeks or so out of the nation out from that ah you know catch a little while thank\nYou for any truth to the room or you're going to NATO to name your baby a Gillum Hannity\n[laughter] was it you want to get a showing it given how do they\nDo have any I mean I looked at my work well revelations [laughter] I've looked at a place that the real Haiti has\nBeen coming from the left it's been ignored by most in the media has been very little coverage I forgot to mention the severed head of a president they didn't seem to outraged about that most people\nAnd now there again there's this selective moral outrage being about Russia\nOr being about sexual assault or allegations of such or about you know vitriolic rhetoric for actions I mean you have people threatening to beat up the president destroy the president bomb the White House and I didn't see the type of outrage we're now hearing from the left\nHey ... you know I think this is happening on both sides and I think there's no excuse for it you know I listen to every pet that you just played and people are hard at work or doing the same thing that we had the ... about the extent to which the president has also made threats and it talked about violence\nI ask you to watch and then ... and what you do is you give me the the predictable liberal talking point I asked you very\nVery specifically about all of the rhetoric that has led up to where we are we've now in the last month watch woman after woman after woman being run out of a restaurant by left wing mobs and the same left wing media didn't have anything to say\nAnd every one of those young rich as a matter of at the new CNN\nWouldn't let their anchors use the word mob\nWell because that's a ... for\nA point it's reality you don't win you know you don't have those those are mobs going after those people I Do I'm not going to defend it I don't think it's right is it a mom to be up to eight and final call like a month to me\nI looked at I think they're presenting talent police officers in Long Island ... when I get in the back in ... you know calling the media the enemy of the people because you and I both know that for the most part journalists from across the political spectrum I just people trying to you know\nWe all don't respect I don't see that I see a media that has been corrupted and complicit\nAdvancing conspiracy theories lies and pure hatred of all things Donald Trump what do you see Jonathan\n[noise] well I'll tell you one thing I I I Will say that I don't think it's a mob I think it is organized gangs\nAnd that's a big difference in a mob mob or people that may or may not have the same interests that gather a to do a certain thing but in this case these people have organization\nThey don't just show up somewhere a ... once these people show up again and again and again that's a very important thing that we need to look at um\n[noise] uh it is to the the way the conversation is going over the past couple of days though I I Want Sean I think everybody needs or work when things are all that rhetoric that you played at the beginning of this was very specific about violence very specific about who to target\nWhen I look at the at the response which you had and which are seeing from other people are when bronco bomber was an office\nAnd when I look at the at the response which you had and which I've seen from other people are when bronco bomber was an office um in in the case of the shooter that shot to\nUm the Mr squeeze 'em what you saw where people not blaming Bernie Sanders but what you see here and I find that is so hard is that uh these devices have been\nOut there that somebody went the distance to to put these things together to uh to carry out a plan covertly to put these things in place all at once and none of them went off and immediately the rhetoric starts in a way that is organized\nAnd now I'm not saying they have something to do with whoever puts these out there but the organization of their rhetoric is so\nTo lead a low on the political chain that it it does make one pause and ask 'em was this rhetoric prepared it's a it's a very alarming thing\nWas that I got Daniel [noise] you know I just I just want to make it really clear I'm not blaming the president today I think that there is\nBlank they light across the entire political patron and what I think regular people like me see if\nI go out and said well I deal with people who don't necessarily agree when\nI get my job and I said I I ... hot and somehow I managed to get around the world around this country to get around my city without inflaming tensions are the people around me and I just don't understand what is wrong with politicians that they cannot get their job is done with that kind of rhetoric\nJonathan the way I look at it as this is now gone on two years of vitriol hatred lies conspiracy theories on a level we've never seen before\nAnd what's worse is you know when the president says the fake news\nA lot of it has been fake news it's not even news all of his political commentary clogged up as news and it's not news at all these are not news channels these are opinion channels\nYou know I don't see much real reporting from fake news CNN or or even NBC ABC or CBS anymore they're all run by liberal

program she tells it out is and sometimes that gets under people's skin\n'em but sometimes that's what's needed and I'm Talking about Wendy Rogers to stick around because Wendy Rogers will be on the program here after this segment to talk about the uh where it's very about this migrant I'm immigrant uh this caravan that's going on in Mexico\nAnd why have we not heard\nMuch of anything out of the uh Democrats who were an office especially her opponent a congressional one Democrat who is currently there are Tom O'Halleran first term Tom why haven't we heard anything\nI mean I talk to Democrats all time and they're not happy about people saying hey we're going to force their way up the border in up to your country uh that's not how it's done\nSo I Want to get her thoughts on that and plus the how the campaign for congressional district one is going I think it's a very tight\nRight now ah but another race I'm looking at her another election this year I'm looking at heavily a is Flagstaff they are at the center of the minimum wage issue a nationwide people are watching this\nA ton of money is pouring in from all over the place or a ton of money is being spent on ads and it it's getting hard to determine what's true what's not true I mean I played that clip yesterday with Jerry neighbors with this like seventies or eighties claiming that the minimum wage work\nThat's why the economy in flights that students do good but the economy and so donors doing good I just saw numbers they're huge increases the economy in Arizona's doing good\nThe U.S economy is doing good it's like steps that influential\nThe minimum wage issue in Flagstaff that the whole country's doing good or is it that the economy overall she's doing good right now and we're lucky that this horrible minimum wage law hasn't affected us yet but what happens during the next downturn\nThat's the big question that many folks who live in a slice of fair who are looking at eventually a minimum wage uh Fifteen fifty and rapidly increasing price\nUh that many folks who live in a fly so fair who are looking at eventually a minimum wage of fifty fifty and rapidly increasing prices that's what they're dealing with that is what proposition for Eighteen is all about\nNow Laurent isn't any student who originally voted for the Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage but now she sees things through a different light\nSo I was a freshman then and I'm actually from Las Vegas Nevada so it was my first selection ever voting and coming into Flagstaff I saw that oh ... for fourteen like minimum wage is going to go up and as a freshman at living on campus\nI wasn't currently working but in the future I knew what it would be getting a job so seeing now I was like wow like I totally am going to vote for that and yeah I voted for it voted for it to pass what\nDid you okay you is your first election where you were Nineteen\nYeah fighting okay so you're Nineteen at a time your your freshman you said you're in the Newtown you're out of your home town you out of your home or your first time voting and you see this year I'm going to make I can make more because you're probably working for minimum wage it's I'm just making a lot of some you know you're you're working for minimum wage of the time\nUm I wasn't working I had been working on minimum wage back in Las Vegas and then in Flagstaff I was just it was a freshman year like I was living on campus likely to just not be doing anything but focus on my study is\nOkay but you vote on this thing and it's like hey we're gonna raise this up because five stuff is very coming from Vegas is a much higher cost of living for some folks who come in from California it's like well this is cheaper right I'm even without a state tuition but for you it was more expensive correct\nYeah and living off campus in an apartment this year and actually having a job now I've realized how expensive it is to live in Flagstaff and it's actually almost sixteen ... percent more expensive in Flagstaff than Las Vegas\nWell okay so your vote for this thing uh and and it passes and it's the Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage did you think was there any I mean I'm just trying to get into the mines that there's no inflation or you know thinking oh this was just going to cause inflation but it's I mean that wasn't going through you\nKnow I mean I was super naive like first year of college wasn't really thing about that all like my parents were so supporting everything so now that I can see that it's actually affecting not just the people in the businesses than just a living wage for me even to get ran or to buy groceries and anything I Do in Flagstaff\nOkay so fast forward um and folks and we're talking with Lauren Bradley who's the senior at NYU and like over who's a yet with the yes on for a chain fast forward well not even two years ... years\nAnd you're seeing the impact now there's a new initiative on the ballot a problem for a team what's changed I assume you're supportive and fourteen\nYes I Am okay why\nI'm supportive of it because when I came back to fly south in August I knew I had to get a job because I was paying for my apartment I was taking classes at any you and I really had to start funding for myself\nSo I started searching for a job and I already knew that the jobs are very slim in Flagstaff just because it is a small community and a lotta people stayed over summer to work\nBut my friend ... she actually could not get a job all summer and how to move back home because she couldn't afford to live in Flagstaff without a job\nSo when I came up here I started applying online and all around and I could not get a job they tell me about like three weeks to find something and that was after applying online going in with resumes and all that so\nThat's when I started to realize that people are not hiring even though they need the help because they are not going to be able to afford it [noise]\nLet me ask you this are you an oddity are huge is is this a rarity among um now you're a senior so you were here for the last election and like I said trust for two years but however there's a whole new crop of new freshman sophomore who weren't here for that process\nAre you hearing any shot or I mean is what is is your position I rare position among students\nI don't think so I think with us seniors and the older ones that we've been there for both of them I think we realized that Flagstaff is expensive to live in and to be in but I think definitely the freshman incoming I don't think they're paying attention to that because like I said when you live on campus during this double yeah so you're not paying attention to it\nBut when you get older and you start realizing\nPeople aren't going to be able to get jobs and if they do get jobs it's just not going to be the same because there is not going to be as many hours to get out anyways [noise]\nFor the show Monday through friday a

years ago where in the midst of recession this is all propaganda garbage is what it is and my big\nUnder do business unemployment rate just say the ten year low well ten years ago where in the midst of recession this is all propaganda garbage is what it is and my biggest fear is once a downturn happens which I don't want to happen but when it does happen watch\nOut watch out so I'm a huge supporter of profit for Eighteen to try to slow this thing down but anyway I promise you take some calls a Larry from Flagstaff ah Larry has some comments on some of these proposals\nI really love your show gray hair in a marriage Jerry on on his are showing formed and a\nSister great big group but uh we're talking about all the um proposals that are on the ticket and I'm what I've done is everything that the city has suggested the city council has suggested for increases and money\nFor projects I voted against every one of them I just don't want the\nUh city kind of courage city council to have control over that much money they've shown that they're not responsible and that they spend their money any way they want regardless of what we want a current in my ballot Monday\nAnd um I voted against everything that the city council wanted money for although I like some of the proposals like lone tree overpass and stuff uh just want to leave with somebody that's going to be more fiscally responsible\nYeah I I I hear your Larry and a great call appreciate that call eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven when I hear that from a lot of people they're just like I'm uh no I just I'm just tired of it\nAnd you see a where some of the money goes you know I I I talked about this thing going on in Apache County yesterday where there's the board of supervisors folks were you know having fun at restaurants and spending thousands of dollars a year and it happens and it leaves a bad taste and folks ah mouth because it's your hard earned money uh but ...\nOne of the things I and Larry thanks for that call one of the things layer is talking about was um this overpass\nAnd it's eighty million bucks a million dollars to okay successive by build bridges and then you got to buy the property I get that but\nPlus plus forty million dollars in interest on top of that white heck are we saving up long term maybe cut some other areas there's millions of dollars they could save a year in just\nOne local government mentioned that everywhere you wonder why we have a Twenty one and a half trillion dollar debt right All right this next call actually came through on our twenty four seven listener line\nEight seven Seventy news twenty four seven eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven and a little background of your has to do with the the minimum wage issue but it has to do with\nMe I actually have a flyer here that I got from ... in the mail has to do with our disabled community and the threat and challenges\nThat organizations like a shiny foundation and uh we had the president and CEO or on the program a couple of months back and get that interview at talk with Jeff dot com but they're having trouble here here's what they're saying in last Eighteen months of increase minimum wage\nAt least forty two disabled people lost their jobs and are still struggling twenty six individuals with disabilities have been forced to leave town thirty percent of providers of closed a relocated sixty eight direct care positions have been eliminated\nTo entire day programs have closed a group homes have relocated outside the city sixty six percent decline in community job placements for disabled workers you\nDon't hear that that those ads from the ah a pro Fifteen folks to you but anyway here's what the caller had to say about the wages\nOr like myself who said he all of them I mean and again it we owe chunk communities have developmental disabilities\nOut of our our\nOur community that's one of the reasons why we the people that you and your professors for for\nThem is that even talk to you know what lessons that they're like Carla realized that hey if we ... region is going to have a lock on or how can that you know things changed it to the walk at\nNight I think what what she's referring to is this was put before the council to change a long time ago\nShortly after the sixteen election and they decided to delay it as long as possible because that can boost the wages high as possible and what they did on top of that is they had fifty cents so Fifteen dollars an hour per per hour wasn't high enough they want Fifteen fifty\nBut I fear if you don't slow this down load the stats I just read to you and I appreciate that call or are going to get worse unfortunately anyway folks you\nLeave your comments anytime eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one a lot more to come or we're going to be talking with a senator or Ernst of Iowa and congresswoman Martha ... Sally when we come back [noise]\nJeff or of a show Monday through friday at three PM on them for\nThey have suffered [noise]\nFolks you've heard me talk about twilight janitorial you know that's why

cleaning it and let twilight janitorial handle all your company's cleaning give twilight janitorial a call today nine to eight\nEight five three eighty sixty four that's twilight janitorial nine to eight eight five three eighty sixty four let's not folks if you're in\nThe Flagstaff area and you're looking for a great office space look no further than Flagstaff for release dot com right now ... dot com has a one room office suite would they shared waiting room starting at one hundred and Ninety nine dollars\nThat's right you can stop working at home and have your own professional office space for as low as one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month\nA showed up uh just bring a child with you whether it's your own or not it's very difficult even determined and so this is just showing we've got a closing loopholes we have to secure our border it's not okay for you to just show up and demand will be let into the United states there's millions waiting in line to do with the legal way\nMy legislation I worked really hard on would have provided thirty eight billion dollars for border security to include the border wall five thousand agents access roads technology intelligence driven operations and the close these loopholes\nSo that our law enforcement wasn't stock that they have no option except to let them go\nSo they have to be stopped Mexico needs to do more but it's happening every single day all the ... the city of a mother mayor or a few weeks ago a has had been told that hundreds of people were going to be released\nHomeless basically into his community every single day because it was exceeding the capacity of ice and others to deal with now some of\nThem NGOs have stepped up but what they're doing is they're transporting them to to thought it'd be nice but it's still hundreds every single day this this is not tolerable it's not acceptable to reasonable people\nDemocrat independent a Republican we have to secure our border and closing loopholes\nAnd stop this uh this caravan and the and as the daily care of and it's coming\nSenator urged how how do we how do we get this fixed senator and she'd you guys get back to D.C\nRight there just um you just heard planned brilliantly laid out by Martha and I\nI noticed this has been almost a year ago Martha and I were out walking on the national mall doing I'm One of my rock marches at\nFive AM in the morning and much of our conversation while we were walking with a various other participants\nWas about our immigration system and how to secure our borders so I have seen this level of commitment ongoing for many years now with Martha not only was she a a protector of the United\nStates has a woman who served in our uniformed services and the United States Air force but that level of commitment has continued on and the United States Congress and her thoughts and ideas that are highly regarded by her colleagues and buy those of us\nIn the Senate as well she has real ideas and real plans as being someone off from a border state on how\nWe need to address that situation she has the foresight to make sure that we are thinking ahead putting plans in place and then executing those plans she takes this job very seriously which is exactly why I Need her in the United States Senate\nOr senator or congressman Michel ... is our veterans' issues both did you serve their nation and I thank you for that um you participated in round table on the issue today first what do we need to do a what's real actual\nPlan a that you can get going when you get back to D.C to take care of these folks I mean shock for so much for our nation is so much has been wrong with the system\nAbsolutely it was great man of diverse group of veterans of different ages all the way from uh just getting out of their initial service to a World War two veteran a men and women are and you know we heard from them but challenges that we're we're up because we are veterans as well\nAbout getting access to care especially for mental health issues tedious the traumatic brain injury that some of our frontline warriors have dealt with\nA one of the you know one of the women in the room our son was a Navy SEAL\nA took his own life uh she had\nThe midst of her grief she turned her greed and do a passion to be a voice\nTo fight for others so that they don't go through the pain that she's been through so we need to be a to be more responsive to our veterans and their families and their need is a big bureaucracy ah like turning an aircraft carrier around we pass the legislation like the VA mission act it's\nGoing to streamline their ability to get care in the community and vote with their feet if there's better care somewhere else and at the VA facility\nBut every single veteran needs to make sure that if they're getting and they they know that if they're getting the run around that they can come to us and we will fight for them in our oversight role in our constituent services role or if it literally takes act of Congress to do that as well\nYeah absolutely and um one thing that I heard Martha say in our veterans round table today is also something that I have shared with my constituents in Iowa and compare and contrast\nIn our her opponent um who would more likely support tower of the union workers than our actual veterans and it's our job and Martha and I know this firsthand as best friends um ... is our responsibility serving in Congress\nTo protect our best friends not to protect\nThe VA um we need the VA to step up and make sure that they are serving our veterans that is our responsibility veterans first the second\nDeaf my you know the Phoenix BA was the you know ground zero of the scandal that's actually in my opponent district she was in Congress are Fifteen months\nAsleep at the switch and the media actually broke the scandal she was totally unaware of it and she's been trying to cover her track from her radical passive wanting to shut down Luke air force base and protesting our troops and all that that you're aware of uh but you know he didn't sense than we've had votes\nIn Congress we have one particular amendment where there was simply saying that VA workers being paid by the taxpayer\nCould not use their work time to do union business they can't do that on taxpayer time and kids in cinema voted against that then when she was given a choice to support the veterans or support it you know the the bureaucratic workers she chose poorly and supported the bureaucratic workers and I think that contrast is one that people\nNeed to be aware of that I got there back I get my care to be a um like the secret shopper there I see the best in the worst of it you know the the good people that are that are nurses and doctors who are are providing for our best\nUh like the secret shopper there I see the best in the worst of it you know the the good people that are that are nurses and doctors who are are providing for our veterans there are many amazing people there there's a lot of others who can't get hired because of that process is cumbersome that I'd go on to something else so that process needs to be streamlined\nSo they get the best care that they deserve\nOur folks congressman Murtha ... going to go since senator Joni Ernst ... urged of uh Iowa\nI'm Martha let me ask you this polls are close a this was going to be a close race I had a poster on the other day and there was something like according to him about Fifteen Percent the shocked me Fifteen Percent of Republicans\nUndecided some of those folks are probably listening right now are they called me from time to time and and mentioned is that they're still undecided what do you say to them\nWell look we're we're trying to win every vote that still out there or whether it's open minded Democrat independent or a Republican but if you're a registered Republican you're a Republican for a reason\nYou believe in lower taxes and less regulation and a strong military and a secure border and that's what we are working on right now ah my opponent has worked really hard to reinvent ourselves\nA as if the moderate Republican but she's not I just ask them to please look at our path\nLook at our voting record in Congress and do you want to keep going in the direction we're going in or do you want that to stop because the path to Chuck Schumer being a charge goes through Arizona and so this is national implications so I asked me to please take a fresh look\nTurn off the TV do the research about each of us and if you if you're a Republican because of the values that we share\nThat what I've been fighting for that's what I've given my entire life to fight for our country and our state and for everyone to have an opportunity to meet their potential and to make sure that our country and safe and secure and I'm going to keep doing that in the Senate and I'd be honored to have their vote\nOr senator urged last word here you're in Arizona here ... uh ... what brought you a while you stumping wise is so important that the Republicans maintain control and the Dems do not get control of the Senate well\nOne I I Am here because that is one of the most consequential right says that we will stay here and the United states of America we are at a an impasse really in the United states that at where\nWe hold a very slim majority as Republicans and we need to maintain that majority we said a stall and done by Democrats when it comes to a President Trump's up white man it could be our judicial nominations that clip the legislation that truly what benefit\nThey citizens that the United states and they looked\nAll and block at every turn and every opportunity\nMaintaining that stayed in Republican hands as well as picking up other states across the United states is a vital vital importance as a second\nI Am here because Martha as a friend um I Will do everything in my power to help my friends and she has been a tremendous colleagues working on a number of issues um between up\nThrough the house and the Senate and of course I Want someone that will be there that will support the initiatives that to add\nThat really do make the United states the\nMost magnificent country on the face at the planet I'm we're proud of our nation we're proud of our service I'm Martha has been there on the front line she understands\nSignificant sacrifice and that's exactly the type of person that I Want to say and the United States Senate done here supporting that's right because um it is a consequential rate advocacy as a friend\nAnd a dear colleague that I Know will make the right decision for the people of Arizona and for the wonderful people at the United states of America\n... is the first ever you
