with us from Pensacola, Florida Hi Brookes welcome to the ...\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nCertain thanks for taking my call uh my wife and I were moving out to a San Diego station out there uh we have a four house here in Pensacola and um I Know you normally\nSay not to buy a house if you're in the military\nUm but uh [noise] make good money last two times I've done it and uh I Am uncomfortable having my whole network and uh [noise] in the stock market basically because we'd be looking at his house about three hundred fifty K. um you know we have three hundred and Fifteen cayenne retirement already in\nBut I Would have to take a two hundred twenty five K. and non retirement investments in order to be able to afford a house up there and also you know I don't want everything in the stock market so don't want everything in one house ... going to live their short time and I wanted to know your buddies\n[noise] [noise] um I don't have a problem with you not wanting everything in the stock market\nI Would not long distance landlord in order to accomplish my goals though so you're talking about keeping the homeless by foreign Pensacola when you moved to San Diego is that what you're telling me\nNo sir ah we have it on the market I I I don't mean to cash out of this now is on really they're gonna by how well their cell phone they pulled out of three fifty okay and uh you're not going to be able to buy anything in San Diego for three fifty\nWell not unless I catch something on retirement investments are you know at two twenty five ... you know I can afford something up there\nAnd watch the rabbit on retirement is that all you've got a two point five getting on retirement about a half million dollar house then yes or or what's your household income\nOr about one eighty okay\nThe reason we tell folks to not buy in the military in most cases is because you're not in the home long enough for it to appreciate enough\nTo sell it and make a profit and also sometimes some military markets have an oversupply of homes on the market they're hard to resell\nSo you get stuck in it and you lose money on it\nIn some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually and certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to see incredible appreciation and incredible market activity\nIn both of those mortgage you should so so you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing\nAnd you should be able to do the same in San Diego and I do agree real estate prices are up substantially um\nI'm not sure that you have to use all of that I Would probably if I were in your shoes what would I Do if I woke up in your shoes or I Would either a rent or be I Would pay cash for whatever I bought in San Diego\nAnd that would mean one of two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not gonna I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending instead of ... million five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and non retirement um or I'm I'm just going to get comfortable\nIn order to have a house like that with having no non retirement investing until I re sell this house now if you ...\nIn order to have a house like that with having no non retirement investing until I re sell this house now if you re sell this house let's say you bought it for five Seventy five or five fifty use up all your cash or non retirement cash and money from this other home\nAnd it goes up to seven hundred and when you sell it you're probably next move moving to a cheaper market\nThere's not any more expensive markets for you to move to in the military than San Diego\nThat's about the also I mean Hawaii Hawaii maybe okay by a there's a couple of other I mean there there's one or two but most of the markets would be well most markets in general not just naval markets but markets in general would be cheaper in the San Diego I think we all agree to that so if you make some money and you're there are three years\nAnd you sell out you're going to put money back in on retirement investing in by a less expensive home maybe a larger home but less expensive home the next by and the next station does that make sense yes or the so it's not really a permanent decision even if you use all your non retirement cash\nI'm with you I don't think I'd want to use it all I'd probably try to buy something\nIn the foreign hundreds instead of in the five hundreds leaving me with some cash\nIn non non retirement investing a but the point at your point you're making is from my portfolio standpoint I don't like it all being in one house and I don't like it all and I don't like so much of it being um I don't like using up all my non retirement investing from a portfolio standpoint my answer to that is is not for that long\nYou're not going to be there ten years\nAnd if you are that that makes us going to change during that ten years\nOr so but if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of real is different expense of real estate in the next next location that your station I thank you for serving your country sounds like you're doing a good analysis on it I'm just kind of joining you in the discussion Jason is with us from Tucson, Arizona Hi Jason how are you\nHow you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI I own my own business and I'm a try to figure out how not to be climbing under orange is the minimum\n... years old but what retirement should I go or oh\nOkay well you know how how do I start or retirement I guess I\nDo you ... well the first thing we teach folks to do is to get out of that and have an emergency fund before you start retirement and the reason is because if you don't have any payment you have more money\nFreed up to put into retirement and then we want you to put five Fifteen Percent of your income and a return a magician what do you make a year\nA band around a lot of average probably right about a thousand elite [noise]\nOkay so somewhere around fifty grand a year okay the affair and how old are you I'm thirty four and okay good do you have any debt no good for you are you single OK okay does your wife work outside the home\nYeah yeah she's a nurse\nWhat did she make a right about that and get all kinds All right so you got about a hundred and twenty thousand dollar household income and no data\nAnd you're thirty four years old well done well we want to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses that grandma's rainy day fund and then we would tell you to put Fifteen Percent\nYour household income into retirement and that's going to be about Eighteen thousand dollars a year in your case going into retirement and now you're asking how to fund that if if she as a nurse has a four oh three or four one K. available at our hospital or a doctor's office\nYou would put some money there especially if there's a match\nAnd then you both need to do a Ross IRA you can do five thousand five hundred each that's eleven thousand dollars of the Eighteen that we need to be putting in right there\nAnd put that in good growth stock mutual\nFunds and Jason to help you set that up and teach you how it works just because you need to learn how it works you don't do it because I said do it or someone else said do you do it because you understand it and you don't buy something you don't understand when it comes to investing\nThat I recommend good growth stocks mutual funds for your

a student loan payment and it was an awful feeling it hurting but a good feeling\nTo show how much of the six years did you move closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years a product of the last year last year the incomes doubled down right ... and so that's a relatively new figure correct them and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right there so you really have been doing this ... broke out and then the last year kicked in about the time you saw the light at the end but Donald income comes up ... yeah I mean what what was the hardest part of this for you all six and a half\nAnd a good\nAnd I think for me the hardest part was I'm starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause when you see that a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of paper\nOr to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and um so I think when we paid off our first student loan um that was just\nSuch a victory feeling for us so it was really hard at the beginning to go from letting our money kind of flow out wherever and to really nail down a budget and during the envelope system and that was hard for me to do\nNothing for me it's just as the sacrifice um you know the world we live in just the spirit of comparison and just seeing everyone around you spend money and buying mood nice things and I'm just constantly you know talking ourselves that will be later and you know when we went through the class and I know it's kind of what you always say but really\nIt's been embedded in me is just you know live like no one else so that you can look like no one else in a really close to that because there were times where we wanted to give up or they would have been easy to just you know do by what we wanted\nTo be here now to be able to talk to you and all these people and just say that we did it it's just an amazing feeling so\nNear free now those are the ... last three hundred pounds [laughter] it really does I mean as much a lot of the ... yeah that's pretty incredible ... well I Know it's a long time and a lot of sacrifices are worth it is or is it was we go back into no no\nNo no we've never had credit cards we want to cash flow um where I babysat for well at the beginning step to babysit for but we're wanting to save up to cash for for a mini van\nDriver learn that say that but during the world ...\nGood good for you guys shaky well congratulations to you have more

I Would just rather ... at least this was the mindset was that I Would rather have him there\nAnd uh we get some tax benefit from the house so I assume that the law hundred and thirty six dollars amongst that we're losing our actually getting back at the end of the year to at least break even or maybe still make some money on on the home\nFor joining us America Marisa is with us in Lafayette, Louisiana how ... how are you\nHow are you better than I deserve how can I help\nQuite and I hadn't seen I graduated a year early and I said here a lot of parents made because of the scholarship opportunity I Do not know how does it work myself while they're on the nursing school because nursing school effects eight high oriented programs\nOkay shall we say I'm Sorry ... show you how old I said anything you've told me that I'm showing now and you stayed there because of the scholarship Yes sir to nursing school\nYes sir it's a it's a I graduated here parents need to get the job opportunity\nOkay so the scholarship is partial Yes sir how much of a scholarship that you get\nAt twenty thousand every four years that it wasn't a large white\nTwenty over four years and it's a four year old program I take it a fair trial and what does it cost\nA dollar a yearly\nOkay which you have five it's actually need eight Yes sir plus you need to eat yeah there's that detail right where are you living with friends family what\nI'm living where frankly I bought a house out in the country because it's cheaper\nYou and some friends were roommates yeah okay and so you have rent\nAnd electricity or share and you have food and you need to get out and you need eight thousand dollars a year\nOkay\nSo when we add all of that up what does your rent and other stuff cost you a month\nCost me about nine hundred dollars and they are going on like and I work minimum wage and things like clean up you know how they've and things like that trying to make a little bit of extra money\nMhm okay right so let's let's kind of had that up then I get about twelve thousand dollars a year for that and I need a thousand dollars a year for ... for tuition and some other you probably some books and stuff too but we're pretty close there so twenty thousand dollars a year is what you need to earn\nIt there and minimum wage doesn't do that sounds like you need a new job\nAnd I have an opportunity to start a whole failing family name brand clothing\nBut you need a new job [noise] and I have an opportunity to start a whole failing family name brand clothing and and now I don't have the money to pay up right now\nNo you don't need to get into that you have a job you need a job you need to show you can make more you can make 'em Fifteen twenty dollars an hour babysitting and managing you can make\nGood money cleaning houses Fifteen dollars an hour or ten dollars an hour cleaning houses a walking dogs uh other stuff so I I think we need to get your doing something along those lines and the other benefit of those are not only do you make a lot more than minimum wage\nAnd by the way you make enough to work your way through with the numbers that you and I are discussing here I'm In um you are going to be working all the time though\nAnd if you but if you can get a situation like that the semi self employed where you're cleaning some houses you're doing some nanny and you're doing some whatever um and you\nUh you can control your time and you can make more money you can control when you work and how much you work now you are going to\nStruggle because you're going to work and study and got a clash and that's all you're going to do but you can make it if you do that the other thing I Would\nDo is I Would apply for a bunch of scholarships the third thing I Would do is investigate some of the hospital companies that are out there\nParticularly in your immediate area talk to the nursing school and see if there are any of them that if you agree to work for them for a couple of years after school how much of the nursing they would pick up for you\nOkay kind of an indentured servants type program if you've ever heard of those\nIt and I know there is a hospital and actually planning on working at ... ... they will forgive all life like it that way but in fact body\nWell let's see if we can get a job over there now and let them just pay for it now\nOkay rather than have to pay you back for student loans\nBecause I'm trying to keep you out of student loans with the math were you in are doing here\nSo I Want you to apply for a a hundred more scholarships you'll get turned down for most of them but if you get another five thousand it really helps the situation a lot I Want you to think about doing different things for work that make you a lot more money and you can control the time\nAnd I want you to investigate with this hospital or what they will do and talk to the nursing school about ... anything they can do to help you as well that you're working your way through but you you sound like you are\nTo me just talking to you you're you're very very mature for Seventeen years old and it sounds to me like you're a rock star\nThinking and so\nI don't think you need to play beer pong his real\nHot [laughter] I\nI think you don't mind working and and grinding and hustling grind to get your way through this and not come out of this with you know forty fifty ten thousand twenty thousand dollars a student loan that you don't need to it\nBut you're going to have to make some very distinct and very careful choices to do this and the good news is you're living expenses are very reasonable Andrew tuition is very reasonable and the third piece of good news is you've chosen a fabulous career\nIn terms of employment you will be able to get employed instantaneously\nI'm mean nursing is just there's always a shortage\nSo you're going to do very very well but I Would do talk to that go talk to the hospital administrator at the local hospital just shut up an appointment with them and just walk in there like you own the place is a kind of like you can do that\nAnd uh just tell them that they need to pay for your school and then you'll promise to work there how's that work\nAnd how can you help me get through school because I don't want a bunch of student loan debt I'm trying to not be a statistic and you know get get him impressed with you and and let him help you be a hero in your story and a him or her that hospital administrator\nWho by the white needs nurses so they're going to be very intentioned\nA very very inclined towards helping someone in your position especially someone who walks in and ask for help and walks in and says what can I Do to earn some help and so on\nAnd um you know get get some people on your side helping you accomplish this um this task splits in front of you but you're on your way you're doing really good congratulations very proud to talk to you call me back if you need help as you're fighting through this Greg is with us from Milwaukee Hi Greg how are you\n[noise] Dave thank you for taking my call how are you today better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] but I just have a question for you I'm On a way out our I've taught for oil and get your opinion on a couple of things here um my wife and I don't have any at all with the exception all\nOf our house um we do a least our cars and um [noise] we do that um I have a customer and that and a good client of mine that I reciprocate or the money that they stand with me back with them so it's kind of a win win situation\nUm for both of us share the main question that I have is we have um [noise] some investments 'em over a hundred thousand dollars with\nI'm Tim Roth IRAs and mutual funds and that type of thing or she has four one K. I. of four one K. I. shares a pension I'm Esther wow and right now we are paying above and beyond our mortgage I'm not a house by about\nTo twenty percent and and putting that toward the house with the amount of investments that we have diversified\nCompared to what we're putting into our houses is that the right formula\nWe tell folks but Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement once you're dead free except the house and have your emergency fund and above Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement and your debt free except your emergency fund then I Will put everything above that towards the house until the house is paid off\nSo I Would take your income sounds point one five\nMake sure the total of all the Roth IRAs four one\nK. close to reaching you're doing is essentially that racism that is greater than that back some of the contributions down a little bit and throw the balance of our service not up to that has to get it up to that that's where the balance of the house and um\nThen we suggest you put the mutual funds category rose wrote an income aggressive growth and international [noise]\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nYou know what I'm saying is that does that ring a bell with you yeah okay yeah you're back yeah they all use back and you got a future and it's right and it's going to be good and ah yeah moving in the condo but it's on my way to a house that I'm a pay cash for 'cause my income is going to go up and goes back\nAnd uh yeah I'm ... I'm not gonna camp anymore fifty five\nIt was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but that but you're you know you got past that stage now your back is that okay yeah it's cool thanks for dropping by saying open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia made clear how are you\nI'm good how are you\nKnow good how can I help\n[noise] um I have a question for you we're calling your data for a little less in the air now and I feel like we are on I had all retirement but we're behind on college savings tracked you can't show how old are your kids\nAnd they are twelve and ten\nOkay and how old are you guys we are forty six okay and how much is in retirement\nI'm a little over a million\nOver your head congratulations ... so what's your household income if not only that way yeah we we are I mean when you have more than a million dollars you're a millionaire yeah okay yeah you're you're right [laughter] [laughter] yeah so ... what is your household income\nA little over two hundred okay so why can you not say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and have plenty of money for college when you've got eight years before college well we're paying for private school right now as well what are you paying for brown to how much cash how much twenty thousand a year per kid or total\nTotal okay you make two fifty when looking at you like it you don't have like two hundred I mean one eighty\nOkay\nAnd if you can cash flow twenty thousand a year for private school that's that cash flow can be turned towards cash flow in college too if they choose a college that's a reasonably expensive\nYeah OK okay that's a good point and yeah All right\nSo I I you know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement you don't need it\nYou're in good shape I agree with you if you want to stop it's not the end of the world\nBut I don't think your house to stop if you'll just sit down and actually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income twenty thousand out for kids to school today\nWe're going to offset some of that with cash flow in some college but some college we want to invest and set aside and put Fifteen Percent of ... side so we're talking about thirty thousand dollars that's fifty thousand bucks going into these two things\nCollege in return I mean I'm Sorry a private school in retirement and then we got to say something to college you say ten grand a year\nPer kid another twenty grand you can do that\nA front from from now until they go to school don't have plenty of money\nI mean you just Jack up for five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control inside that five twenty nine get with one of those smart vest her prose and they'll help you do that ... day Ramsey dot com for a list them in your area\nWhere people we recommend them sit down when you help me with a five twenty nine together and pop ten grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut retirement back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you're not working our plan at this stage\n\nBecause you put Fifteen Percent into retirement until college and it was done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and then you're a baby step seven to increase retirement beyond Fifteen Percent and Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand thirty grand\nSo that that's what I'm doing the math here I think you can do it I think you just gotta sit down and not have this vague worry about it and instead of having an actual game plan will lay out and go this is important this is more important than other things that we're doing that we need to stop doing so that we can do this and that's ten grand a year per kid for college\nTo kids that's twenty grand if that's the way I mean you've got is where you are so good questions thanks for joining U.S Open phones of triple eight eight to five

the director of consumer products in markets for members fear\nAnd this conversation ought to be something we don't have to wait for a special time even though October has been\nFor the last number of years breast cancer awareness month there's a lot of new information from Memphis fear a showing that women who go for an annual breast cancer screenings generally assumed the doctors are familiar with their prior mammogram images\nInteresting returning Jones and I were talking about this off the air she makes her business to go to the same hospital all the time because she knows they have her records\nApparently this is a big problem Kristin why is it that these records are not easily transferable\nWell the learning and ...\nAnd ... yeah it's really great question and a lot of women are ... killing ... trying to make sure that they're all ... to make sure that their records are there that unfortunate challenge and health care in that but those aren't always ... ... with one another they can be on different\nRecords are there that unfortunate challenging healthcare in that hospitals aren't always freely able to communicate with one another they can be on different system\nThey may have different machines that you're images are scanned on and so it is it is a challenge for them to communicate on time especially when it comes down to breast imaging because the ... there's a large\nSo they often are dependent on women driving from center to center to actually gather their own record or they may have to do a lot of phone calls and back in with one another and use\nKorea or services so it is that is a great read yet no excuse me ...\nSo it is a real challenge for women and um which is incredibly important I think for women to understand especially as\nWe continue to be more and more on the news and as consumerism as on the rise and healthcare and we're starting to shop more for providers and trying to find the best bang for our but you know in a doctor\nIt's important that women understand that and they need to really take control of their breast health experience\nAnd make sure that they get copies of their record with and allow them to get the best care wherever they're seen\nOne of the things that I've had in my experience my first and only wife\nDied after Twenty one years of stage for breast cancer or which has a has been pointed out of many people who have cancer or caught too late\nShe had a mammogram and they didn't show any problem in about a month or two later she had a pain in her back\nAnd if you were there that checked out and found that in the three or four months and she had the mammogram the kids who became visible\nAnd then went through all kinds of things that ... you know matter of fact the movies and\nLumpectomy ... and and the man she she lost the lymph node spread it she lost an arm she had brain cancer I mean it was God awful\nAs some of it was because the information they got from one person to another was wrong or just wasn't there so let's talk about what members fear is and how to limit age this kind of a problem Christian\nAbsolutely so I'm I'm Glad you bring that up and thank you again for sharing that story you know you'll find there's probably not a single family in the country that hasn't touched by breast cancer in one way or another and I know\nYou know I I have close family members and the name of it and we all have close friends and even personal experiences where you know you get in inconclusive results on a on the liquor and perhaps because you're going to a special if you're looking for a second opinion or maybe you're just moved\nUm or we're looking for something different and uh you know a good friend of mine her doctor thought that he thought something without those prior mammograms available\nHe wasn't a source that she actually spent days driving all across town trying to get her images on at the the running all over the place because she didn't want to have to undergo another biopsy she had been hit breast cancer history and her path and um I just remember her calling us in tears and the office because\nAs she got all these records over to a doctor physically handed over and he'd gone on for the holidays so she had to worry about whether or not it hits it for the holiday and you know this happened because when it comes\nWhen it comes to breast cancer screening every woman is unique the path mammograms are so important so name fair and what part of a company based in Massachusetts our founders abreast help radiologists and we aim to empower

or not or going into the holiday season are which are probably because the economy's good will be good news for retail stores it'll be good news for people buying online now\nHowever there is some new research\nAnd has been released this week from the national Center for the middle market\nWhich provides a a retail industry for cash in Tom a stewardess here who is the executive director of National Center for the middle market I guess I Want to first find out from Utah Thomas what the National Center for the middle market is it's an intriguing name\n[noise] well do we we are a research organization Research Center at the Fisher College of business at the Ohio State university\nAh we exists to study companies that are mid sized ... uh the middle of a third of the private sector which is companies' sales between ten million a billion dollars a year big and small smaller than big\nAt that actually are uh as I said it's about a third of the economy but it's the lion's share of economic growth the biggest growth is in these companies and we're the only guys out there is a putting ... serious resources in to studying who they are or how they're doing and what they can do to do even better\nSo let's answer those questions who are they in how are they doing I guess the why they may not be you and described her as the with the dollar amounts but are they doing\nWhether that you know and what they are there at all sectors retail medical care a financial services I mean any industry you can think of\nAnd they're doing really well I mean you know revenue growth in the in the last twelve months in the middle market has been more than eight percent and and job growth has been more than\nMore than six percent I we estimate that more than that about sixty percent of all new jobs come come from mid sized companies so they're doing really well uh they're looking forward to the holiday with with with with the holiday season with a lot of enthusiasm but you know tomorrow's Halloween\nAnd the flip side of all that holiday retail is this books and ghosts and goblins in there which is the whole cybersecurity question so uh you know they're also increasingly concerned uh about cybersecurity defending their customers their business their data\nOr against a mounting mouthing cyber threats\nAll right so what's the news this year to protect people that wasn't around last year during the holiday season\nWell what's new is the concern I mean I mean the thing is that that the the attacks constantly mutate it's like the flu virus at yeah this that they're the bad guys out there are always coming up with new ways to try to try to get into your network new ways to try to get around some for five\nThousand let me ask the question in a different way than if I may miss district the problem is that big retailers have had I think you can name any of them Wal Mart target is to me to him right on the top of my head that have had real security breaches and there are a dozen more\nUh so if people go into these stores or even buy from them online\nWhich to secure which to make them feel better and maybe from a business point of view what does the business owner this business group you're talking about do to prevent\nCyber security\nWell the first thing is to get work and pay attention to it and and the good news on that is that we've seen a huge jump\nIn the level of concern by retailers and at all levels aside I mean the nice thing is the smaller retailers ... retail is a really woke up to this issue\nThe second piece of good news is that you see increasing reliance on cloud security which is to say hey\nI don't have the act I'm an expert retailer I'm not an expert cybersecurity\nHello your brother let me go to those ... let me go to Microsoft and Amazon or red hat or many of these others to get my security outsource it to these guys and that ... that's helping\nTo the task or are they able we've had problems most of the company than their own problems more so than Bob's garages\nYeah [laughter] well you know that's\nWe used to agree on the bill of rights do we anymore we either choose the constitution for we do and we have\nNot Glenn

G. Q. columnist or talking about Trump radicalizing within those\nAnd that is the fact that at one of the things that ... really launched his presidential run on and talking about Islamic rattle radicalization and this president has radicalized so many more people than I ever did I mean\nThe way he taught the way the way that is that's just it it's hot the way that don't have it in the ass allows the way as a as a non Navajos\nYou to write it had I Know I'm not going to say it but I'm a national asked quitting his class kind of had signed up hacking down as but then you know\nAnd I think we all see pushback on that you realize that it was about her to say the President's Day says radicalized more people that ISIS is irresponsible\nGay stops you noticed feeling yeah it was not just saying that to hit to to her the guest was saying it to the host yeah Browne you not to push\nBack on that is irresponsible he's not talking about her being respond yeah he's talking about CNN being irresponsible\nAnd one thing to notice in that clip she ... she says uh one of the things that the president ran it was a fighting Islamic extremism and\nNow we know that she is radicalized more people that I said there's a set applied to that so not only is it a catchy little thing that might get her in the news it's also there's a set up lying to it\nTo me obviously a plant line\nObviously she meant was on television and said just that she set it up out of ... didn't make any sense in in the context of the conversation she wanted to get to that line right and she's totally under control ... she's just passionate about it he's just having a conversation yes so here's her apology once you realize how bad that was a few minutes later\nI think I've spoken to hit at the moment that has been a very emotional and personally I think I exaggerate and I apologize for that\nBut what the point at a time have to make is that it's not a coincidence that according to the ... the number of anti Semitic attacks has jumped by nearly ... percent and the first year that Donald sounds like an office and it's no coincidence because\nEven though the main danger is homegrown right wing extremist for many studies have pointed out this ... so I can get away from monitoring before\nWe have all those who falls will keep them from committing violence okay\nRight okay that's not a sort of thing is not an apology further inflame yeah what you were saying and there's no pushback from CNN no they don't care it great for them they like it\nYeah ... because Lincoln leave that they do they believe it it's it it they are ...

course they're racist or sexist massage those thinking Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic oh and by the way Donald Trump's responsible for the horrible shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh and Donald Trump's even though the guy that shot up the synagogue is hated Donald Trump\nFor being so supportive of Israel let's not let facts\nGet in a way of a good propaganda lie in an election year well anyway Republicans now are beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the fact that repeal has to happen but also direct primary care or what I call concierge care for\nEvery American at that this is now gaining momentum and I've had conversations with numerous members of Congress in the Senate as we move forward and\nThere are a couple of plans that are percolating one would be block granting money to states so that they can become\nYou know the fifty outlets of of new innovative medicine and they'll turn over every penny because their political futures will be dependent on it which would be a good thing Gavin Newsom wants to universal free care for everyone he gets X number of dollars good luck with that but in states red states with smart governors\nOr it can be a lot different and a lot better you know we we often go to the case of health care savings accounts\nAnd that would be your only count you manage every year and set of eyes yearly checkup and your younger years you're building up money it's your money\nBut when you get older you really get sick that money that account has built up a fortune and you couple that with catastrophic care fairly inexpensive\nDepending on what you had to duck the bowl is you know you could pay as low as a hundred bucks a year and get a great catastrophic plan if you have a heart attack a cancer\nOr have a bad accident but anyway the health care cooperatives of Dr Josh ... has been a pet project on this program of ours now for years and he joined us atlas MD Wichita, Kansas he joins us with Dr Lee as grows and he's the president for doctors for patient care foundation a thank you both for being with us\nDr Robert just to remind people I I Lived in Wichita I could walk into your office pay you fifty bucks a month\nI get unlimited care twenty four seven I got a Ninety five percent reduction in all of my prescription medicine costs and my kids get\nUnlimited care for ten bucks a month is that true that\nIs ... uh every American could have ... level direct care just like you know how important people like Sean Hannity um yeah I don't think people under stand just how important this election is um we see how divisive DC as we see how much infighting they raise ... and we don't want those people managing our health care\nEvery American deserves Affordable Care and the direct care model cars\nManager for a penny a pill labs for two or three dollars unlimited visits no copay brief procedures we can fix is we can um work with employers and redesign insurance plans to decrease savings their premiums by thirty to sixty percent we can do that but we need Republicans in office\nAllowing the free market to function because if we go back towards a and Affordable Care act dial a Medicare for all\nIt would decrease our ability to really you know in his day in a way that is meaningful for patient and more importantly shot you know we're looking at a decision right now we have two completely different visions on healthcare future one is a completely government controlled socialized medicine or you're gonna inserts that government between patients and doctors\nAre I think the cabin out here you know that's how the ... that's the same government that's going to control your health care or you have another position that his health care freedom and he's with the freedom of choice between you and your physician\nAre worth your decisions are not being made public a\nPie by the government and so you know while direct primary care is is not a partisan solution it is a solution that has been graced by most Republicans that are running including or just saying this is running for governor in the state of Florida he is a race this Newt Gingrich has put this in his you know to\nDirect primary care and his platform a so this is definitely a platform that Republicans are supporting so if you want freedom this is definitely the vision for him\nI mean the thing is it's almost mind numbing to me and you you know what you're right Dr Josh I have friends of mine that are doctors and because it's not because I pay them to be honest but I could pay them I mean I I Do pay them in other ways and thanked them when they do favors for me but\nUm I I Will tell you that I can make a call at three o'clock in the morning any day and get a doctor's care\nAnd get a doctor's recommendation and didn't and you know what if every American white a white only a few Americans deserve that or they ended up going to the stock in the box places and I'm not now playing them like I'm sure they play a vital role in certain towns and communities\nBut I don't think it's ideal because I think most people pick a doctor because they like and trust that individual and know that that person knows who they are and knows their medical background that's important to\nYou man everybody should be able to choose that and I think that goes back to what Dr gross is saying about this is a referendum on freedom\nAnd we want freedom in our schools in our homes and all that kind of important decisions we make but then we we've been you're missing that level of freedom when it comes to the most important decisions in health care\nSo this really is a crucial step in history\nWhere we can say look the free market can do this better than the government's been doing it people aren't happy with health care system now and met our ten dollars a pill we we want freedom and health care we what choice do direct care model\nAllows you know every man woman and child preexisting conditions or not to get incredibly high quality care in an affordable way\nI'm Shaun how are you know it shouldn't be of course I you know in our practice we have not raised our prices from eight years we've heard sixty dollars a month for eight years for unlimited\nI'm Shaun how are you know it shouldn't be of\nCourse are ... you know in our practice we have not raised our prices for eight years we've heard sixty dollars a month for eight years for unlimited primary care services\nAre X rays are twenty five dollars are in our eyes are two hundred and twenty dollars these are all affordable so if preexisting no pre existing condition the question is can you actually for it to get the care unique by the doctor you need when you need\nA and these direct care solutions getting the government out of the middle of this relationship can actually do that so you need to embrace of the people that are running for office that support the freedom and health care\nYou know it seems that you know it's so simple and so basic and so fundamental and this is where I got frustrated with Republicans because they had promised repeal replace and they weren't ready for the moment there's no doubt about it now to the president's credit\nHe got rid of the individual mandate but that's only a first step in if every Democrat is going to go out there and say well we're gonna have we're going to have better health care options for the American people but in many cases that the very same people that gave us the failure of Obamacare\nWhen you're offering a health care cooperative model you've duplicated down how many practices across the country ...\nWe've helped over five hundred and fifty practices get locks but there's over a thousand growing every day I'm you know we had a twenty practices started last month alone that's a new practice every business day\nA man and you're having direct access at every individual twenty four seven direct access to a doctor there are no pre existing condition prejudice at all and these practices exactly have you can afford a cell phone you can afford direct patient care primary care there\nIs no insurance except you probably would want a couple the direct care with like a catastrophic plan which is fairly inexpensive\nOwners you have car insurance for the big stuff but I think you know a point that goes unmentioned is the fact that these insurance premiums are going up\nTwenty thirty percent of review and ... and I never raised her prices is\nKilling the economy it's killing jobs it's taking\nMoney trying to be noisy but are you making at fifty bucks a patient I'm I I I make a month you making any money\nWhere do you want me to it hasn't been acquired yeah yeah I mean this is\nNot that acquired by the big boxes you know we're able to keep the practices of floats or able to drive interest in primary care were able to treat people in the rural communities these practices are in inner city there are critical access hospitals are critical access communities in suburban and urban setting a and it's\nWorked out very quickly and same poor people in America people we defined as poor or lower income they can pay fifty bucks a month and they can get a hold are you twenty four seven and if they need to Z pack they're going to walk out what is the pack and pay above the Z pack\n... ... ... yeah they should be able to get a stink about it the poor and ... the more you need a mock like this they might treated a study on Oregon's Medicaid system and only twenty cents on the dollar cut to the recipient\nGoing to lead you to have a functioning car and car insurance and gas money to get to the doctor if you're poor you can texture doctor you can email you can call them you don't have to leave the house necessarily because the doctors are\nAnd how many patients you have a we have about six to seven hundred per doctor\nOkay so you know with all the way and I'm like most practices probably most of your patients like me\nI really don't want to see you unless I really need you unless I'm saying hello or you know say let's go fishing together hum this most people will drive but there's probably at least ten patients of every practice when they're calling me every day I'm assuming\nWe we have our high utilizes and our lives\nAre we are ... we have our high utilize there's a we have a few pains and they asked it never stop you know we factored that in um the part\nOf the program we have doctors coming from a three hundred and fifty doctors from forty one states descending on our land this weekend to attend the conference to learn how to set up their practices after this so now with over a thousand practices nationwide already practicing the director model\nOur looking increase that just by thirty percent with one conference alone or the interest as massive will keep growing and as long as we put policies in place the state and federal level they continue to allow these practice to\nGrow and blossom uh you'll see this moving moving all across the country are getting better access better care for their cost\nThere are some um collateral damage\nSome others who do not share a veal wild healthy

er here we are one week away from the election and one of the big races were watching obviously is the race for Arizona Governor a you have an incumbent Republican governor\nDoug Ducey who by the way will be on the program this Friday you'll hear governor Doug Ducey I and also the his his challenger Democrat\nOr David Garcia who's on the program just a couple of weeks ago\nBoth their interviews or are there are up at talk with Jeff dot com so go check it out but what I wanted to do here is I pulled apart uh they're pretty lengthy interviews and tried to get into some of the subjects in the first thing I wanted to compare them on is their stance on taxes uh first up\nHere's David Garcia and we were talking about how do you fund education and dedicated income streams and basically ... thoughts on taxes she was David Garcia\nWill ultimately I think it's important we put a dedicated revenue stream in front of Arizona and it's what we need in Arizona and to make sure the dollars going into education\nI Am committed to working with the legislature or to put one on the ballot for Arizona's I Believe they do want to vote on\nAn initiative of that sort and I'm happy to work with them on what that looks like I think what we need to do is bring together the education community the business community look at what our taxes infrastructure looks like here in Arizona and decide what makes sense for us\nYou know there are pluses and minuses to any one of those sources depending on how you want to look at it Arizona is very reliant on sales tax mhm and the challenge with that is self taxes the most volatile it's one of the reasons why we're in a kind of a feast and famine mode a lotta times here in Arizona\nI'm ... and in addition I Believe that the educators pointed toward the income tax and particularly in the top one percent because that's where wages have been growing by and large\nTo give you an example and twenty Seventeen CEOs in Arizona I got a forty seven percent raise forty seven percent in one year and uh the thought is that those folks need to pay their fair share so that they're contributing to Arizona going forward\nSo I actually did a follow up to that because anytime I hear the words are people need to pay their fair share I I like to point out that um those highest income earners in this country pay the highest amount of taxes in a dollar for dollar a figures I pointed that out to David Garcia and here's what he had to say\nActually if you take into account all taxes Arizona has the highest regressive tax structure in the country meaning that our lowest income Arizona's pay more as a percentage of their income obviously not as total is total another Senate should as a percentage of their of their income\nAnd it's because sales taxes are largely aggressive\nAnd you know the thought in Arizona is we we we have historical I used to work at the legislature and the conversations I heard was well the sales tax tourists come and they pay it people come to Arizona but the challenge without is everyday Arizonans paid every single day\nAnd um and so as a percentage Arizona has pretty progressive tax structure um in terms of our lowest income Arizona's bang highest amount as a percentage of their income\nAnd here's some comments from governor Doug do see on taxes\nI've talked a lot about lowering our income tax you know a Nevada has zero income tax tax has zero income tax\nBy opponent would like to double income tax in the state of Arizona I think that's the wrong direction and about the worst idea of possible\nBut when we do have a booming economy like we do I think to look at our income tax to look at our sales tax to look at our property tax and say is there a way to reform\nThe tax code where we're actually able to bring in more revenue for our general fund but we make our state more attractive as a place to live and do business and I do think it's possible it would be a heavy left\nBut you can only do it when your economy is growing and we haven't had the economy like this it over ten years last time this happened what jet and Apollo data did was she spent us into a whole ship bankrupted the state weight over forty percent growth in our spending what she real reform on our on our taxes\nAre budgets have been very responsible to point nine percent average drove less than that population growth in inflation and today we're sitting at a record amount in our general fund it gives us options it's good news\nSo what's governor do you think about uh how to do this how do you change the tax system in Arizona and what he what he does here and this is good because she had comments on this as well he refers back to the two thousand eighty economy and what happens under prior administrations as far as\nThe budget getting bloated\nWe haven't had the economy like this it over ten years last time this happened what Jan and Apollo data did was she spent us into a whole ship bankrupted the state weight over forty percent growth in our spending what zero reform on our on our taxes\nAre budgets have been very responsible to point nine percent average drove less than than population growth in inflation and today we're sitting at a record amount in our general fund it gives us options it's good news\nNow David Garcia also mentioned two thousand eight levels and decided to do with the pay increase the teachers keep in mind teachers got ... percent by twenty twenty pay increase last year because of the legislature and governor juicy sinus into law\nUm but he mentions in refers back we need to get back to two thousand and eight levels here's a David Garcia\nTheir goal is to get back and I I support the school to get us back to two thousand eight funding levels that does not sound like it's a lot\nOf what to go back to a decade ago but to get back to two thousand they levels we still need about eight hundred million more dollars into public education to get back to ten thousand eight levels\nBack eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one I Want to welcome back to the program Congressman Paul ghosts our Congress and go or how are you today I'm doing good yeah\nHey what okay so President Trump you and I've talked a lot congressmen about this a birthright citizenship and immigration issues President Trump has come out with something does talk about that he's talking about birthright citizenship what's your take on it\nWell or you know everybody what point back to the fourteenth amendment Jeff and this was an amendment that was constructed in in a coup sixty eight um in regards to a post civil war status of a slave\nAnd basically the final conversation piece from the Supreme Court was based on it including the decision about some Chinese immigrants\nWho have legal status to be here are not citizens but legal status\nThat their children could could become children could be a citizen but go wherever rarely did decide whether somebody here illegally um merits that\nAnd everybody can point to go back there is there are sort of fills in the United states and the state where they reside are subject to this just jurisdiction there up and most people believe that that interpret it legal jurisdiction not illegal to restriction\nHi folks Congress and go search and I guess like congressman let me ask you to so how's it work now if someone is pregnant for example and comes across the border illegally will soon and have a a kid in a in a U.S\nRight now they're citizens correct\nWell that's what being interpreted okay uneven guesses bad this is Jeff is that we're Chinese on that don't want to wait for\nA any type of these others so what they do is they plan of pregnancy becomes here or in the third trimester and half baby here and it's a bee for medical term is\nInteresting well has this been challenged congressmen goes sorry I mean has this gone to the Supreme Court as anyone pushed us up and tried to sell it is interpreted correctly\nIt was done late in the eighties nineties and go at that time we didn't have airplanes or they could fly across continents we didn't have a corporate ... upcoming legally instead of doing the right way\nAnd so this was this was a you know we've been a big proponent move extra push legislation they lose a gram Senator Graham is actually going to say it's absurd um but we have they found is to come here legally\nI'm sure I have a child her and then they become citizens or you know as a President Trump calls make or break on but that's exactly what it in a enticing to do it in high school is illegal activity and\nNo I didn't go Americans have big heart but we can't do it for the world will have to enable the world and we have to follow up good prospects in this country to be a citizen\nManaging congressman go started the anchor part of that comes from okay you have that baby here and then all of a sudden through a process and it may take some time but a lot of other family wind up coming in getting citizenship is that is that what you've seen\nA nuclear can bring your parents who have a lawbreaker that's that that's part of the column but I think a lot of people across the bottom for these kids that are ... they're not in their own volition\nUm but by done if not right or to allow the law breakers to come into this country or that we have to have this conversation and I think the president is right\nTo have this conversation and have this fighting and the Supreme Court\nWill Congress and he wants to go through executive order potentially does this wind up you you get back in there you go back in January whenever you go back does this wind up being a long protracted fight fight is this the constitutional fight what happens when you see\nIt it was an equal out all aspects of power and so you know that there will be a case that will that will be garnered and it will be challenged them can run into the white poll a Congress can take this out no we're in equal Barney a Supreme Court and the executive branch\nSo you know if it's high time that we have a rebuilt sort of this was conversational piece so um you know it will eventually end up in the Supreme Court as being a bitter and and you know we'll see whether they uphold the rule of law in regards to coming to this country the right way is a legal way\nI'm In a ...\n... are we one of the few or industrialized countries and sometimes I mean if I go to Germany or Japan or other countries out there that have changed us\nBut it was a lot of kids that are very similar to us um but um once again they're not they're not the draw the United states is\nJust like any up China you know this is a big tourism type of medical turtles [noise] you know when you have a child but ... you can go all the applications and moved to the front of the line and makes it easier access to this country\nAnd congressman goes I mean we're on the we're we're watching this caravan which I don't know maybe falling part may not be but still the idea of it\nOf thousands and thousands of folks marching up through Mexico from Central America saying hey we're going to the U.S and we want to get in ... we ... and I don't blame them for wanting to get in but they're doing it wrong and it it it's the same thing your thoughts on that\nAre about these folks coming in what happens when and if they get to the border\nThis is sort of been the fight is is that we're now where you were to be a most people will see the pictures of this caravan you know storming absolutely like gates an ... uh in Mexico\nThe issues of this caravan storming ... gave some fans in Mexico\nBut those are sort of like a law abiding people and and most people here in this country if you want to come to this poetry or with the first thing what you ought to do to follow the law ... law breaker you know the Supreme Court justice Brandeis made a comment and the government of laws\nBut if the government doesn't uphold the law scrupulously it in a invites ... invites a everyone to be a lawyer to themselves\nThat's exactly what we're engaged here\nI'm Bad behavior lawlessness and uh you know even that favors wanted an organizer for the immigration they want to do background door to go out people tune in to this country\nAnd they wanted in a uniform aspects so um I I you know I think the federalist papers give us a good background and all the time that we we visited there is a good time and a history particularly when it's going so misused\nA congressman ghosts are one way to go to the election a huge sweeping around the state I'd imagine what's your plan to your last week of campaigning\nIt is the you know or you know most district you're most of the growth could actually kept yeah most of the people you know do mail in ballots so you know we're trying to get from other people across you know ... you got it right right state wide elections\nThat people need some help so you know we want to get make sure everybody gets the without get their vote in ... um you know if you don't have your mail in ballots are after all we make sure you drop it off\nGo out and vote this is very important you can either have a socialist country a direction that we're going with the Democrats or you can go with a uh making America great again\nAll right congressman goes are always appreciate your time best of luck coming up here one week from to that you're almost there\nThey they do if they\nAre I talked to use in our folks are open up the lines here would love your comments we have a leg over coming up

I was sample my father is a small business owner and ...\nRight and they had to raise their rates and it just it's a chain reaction throughout the\nSystem absolutely I have a sample my father is a small business owner and he owns a construction company and I talked with him and I asked him what he would do if he if his pay if he was forced to pay his entry level employees forty percent more\nUh over the over the next couple of years he said that the first thing he would do if you will charge more for the talk for building the building from building a house and then so if you build an apartment building and it costs more to build the apartment building\nThe landlords don't have been charged the tenants more and that's going to end up hurting the renters more which are the people that need the minimum wage increase and so the very people that this was supposed to help it's going to hurt because it's done foolishly and it's going way outside\nOf the scale of the state and it's going to kill this a community both the nonprofit community and the small business community Hey Greg I appreciate you listening to thank you for your call and thanks for your service\nYeah no problem yeah there\nAre folks eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety someone what has been like ... flights that feeds a raise what has been the response to hay prices have gone up\nOr shut because honestly I've invited the um the folks from that group on the show for years a flight to city councilwoman ever put silver for example uh they have not come on to date it's been two years I'll hold out my hopes\nBut what are they saying I rely on you as far as price increases as far as under employment\nIs it just you're not a good business owner I you know what I'm saying they\nActually ... say all the time but if you cannot afford to pay a this increase in minimum wage then you don't deserve to have a business like God Forbid somebody has the American dream God Forbid somebody wants to expand the uh businesses into a community like if you\nIf you want to be ... if you want to open up a dance studio for example and ah you know for exercise purposes and you want to hire two or three people to a to B dance instructors or exercise instructors you have to\nThem what the at least the minimum wage and and then you have to charge people more what they're saying is if you can't afford to pay all those people the increase that you have an budgeted\nThen you don't deserve to have that and then that's going to hurt this community it's going to hurt this area and we've seen that and not just in you know the restaurant industry or hotel industry\nWhere small business in history we've seen it in the non profits and we've seen it in like our child care services there's a great radio at the chamber has up right now with ah the owner of Kane them kids I'm a ... a daycare where she's literally fearful that if this goes up she's going to have to shut their doors or what\nI Can't stand as a and it sounds like a lot of people wrote this that probably never ran a business business owners want one of their first priorities is paying their employees I I can speak of this from personal standpoint I've said this before in the show\nOr when my wife in July started our first company we went many many many months without being able to draw dime when we're shoveling money in because we had to pay our employees had to keep the lights on and spent a long time and in many folks are listening or small business owners they realized this and they struggle for many years\nAnd then maybe maybe like a ten years down the road Twenty years down the road they can take a vacation they can go to I don't know like ... yeah and I saw this fits your on Facebook at irritated me to no end that hey\nYou know ... you don't want to pay your employees more because you want to take these rich luxurious I'm paraphrasing vacations to ... this actually happened now\nYeah so the no campaign posts on her face but they share three photos about how these rich ah people these which business owners and they're specifically going after like the hotel owners\nThat are that they are making themselves rich at the expense of their employees that clean the toilets and they shared a picture of a toilet and they shared a picture of three three kids that are definitely poor leaning against a wall so\nWas looking at um like one I've met most of the business owners and the sound who is that business owner a but to where like where is that a dopey wall so we did some research what we found out was this one\nThe picture of the business owner is taken from a article from Forbes magazine for good outcome\nIf not to anybody from Flagstaff and in fact the article says that any ... a reproduction are we use of any image in it without the express written to a permission of Forbes and without the permission and without a link to the entire article is a dense their violations to\nThe picture of the three kids definitely you know we need to help them uh and if anybody can give me a plane ticket to China\nI Will gladly food to them because that's where those three kids are from they weren't for the fly from Gene Gene China ads you even find this out I I don't know I don't really crude oil is great yeah okay okay so did they removed\nBecause that's their their hugging at the heart string yeah and and they're they're sending out these fires are sent out these ads in there a look at these kids that can't afford it and and they show the and then look at this rich guy who's in Kabul and I've been a ... couple of times I mean it's it's it's been many hours\nIt's it's it's nice it's a\nIt wasn't a luxury as me although you could stay at a place that super expensive but uh anyway sidetracked but they're talking at the heart strings no there really is it working well it's working so they get caught up\nFor their lives and they and that's not the first lie it's not going to be their last line because that's all they have\nAnd so I told him out yesterday I not only commented on it but I also shared it and pull and pull them out for it by the league of their post but not before we got screen shots another post that they did was a a young business owner in town her name's Taylor moody she open up a\nA ... a a skin care or a company okay or she's the only employee there her father's a business owner as well a great guy here in town\nAre Frank Riggs is running for superintendent of public instruction for Arizona Frank welcome back to the program how you doing today\nThanks for having me on Jeff doing just fine working real hard over this final week of the campaign\nYeah you ... you got to have the the stamina to keep it going right [laughter]\nYeah I always get that you know campaigns are marathons because obviously they play out over a long period of time but when you get in the home stretch it so you know it's an all out sprint\nYeah and you're you're you're spring you running hard the reason why I said that is because you know there's there was one paper that said hey ah you know you got the experience but I look who's going to the younger person right [laughter] [laughter]\nWell I get I hearken back to Ronald Reagan it was sort of my inspiration for getting involved in the Republican Party and ultimately running for office you know running for Congress\nBut he famously said in the debate in Nineteen eighty four kids Walter Mondale that you know I won't I won't make my opponents age and inexperienced an issue in this campaign they're you know you you know the fact of the matter is my democratic opponent not not only has very very limited experience\nA couple of years of of a preschool teaching in a couple of years has a speech pathologist which which I value because I Know the importance of special education sure but the fact the net or a she has no leadership experience in education or in any other field or endeavor she's never\nBeen in a diminished radio supervisory or managerial capacity\nAnd has no preparation or qualifications frankly for that matter to leave the Arizona department of education it's seven hundred dedicated employees and get them which which ultimately account for almost forty five percent of the state budget the single largest line Idaho yeah but yeah so\nLike Frank Riggs is my guest uh brings running for superintendent of public instruction\nUm this is an important race and this is probably one of the closer races actually and I mean it was back in fourteen as well But Frank if folks aren't familiar with the you've been on the program quite a few times interviews are up and I talk with Jeff dot com folks can check that out but just to remind people I mean you you were in Congress\nAnd you abided if memory serves me right you abided by term limits you you took yourself out\nWell I did I thought that we accomplished a lot of of least what I set out to accomplish as a member of Congress when I left Congress the federal budget was balance for four consecutive years that was the first I certainly hope not the last time in our lifetimes\nBut I Believe elective office should be short term public service I I have to chuckle Jeff because one of the arguments are tax used by the other side the left\nOr is that I'm somehow a career politician occur politician who kept his term limits promise\nServed three terms six years but in the context of a long career that spanned well over Thirty years beginning at five in my military service I'm a proud army veteran the seven years that I spent law enforcement as a police officers or the twenty plus years I've had in the private sector as a businessman and CEO the ten years\nThat I had as CEO of a national education nonprofit\nSo you have ... and not the veteran my educational leadership at every level local state and federal beginning by being an elected public school district board member for five years including two years has the board president and as we've talked about before what prompted me to get involved in education was the work I did as a law enforcement officer in schools\nAre coming into contact with juvenile offenders and that risk students and realizing as Frederick Douglass said centuries ago it's much easier to build strong children then to repair broken men and then also for the ... I wanted to do something that would be more proactive and that really met going in education and again working with the most disadvantaged and vulnerable segments of the student population\nFrank I uh played a little medley before and then three o'clock hour I I've had on a governor do she's been on the show many times we'll be back on friday I had David Garcia who's running for governor in the Democratic side on as well and we got talking about taxes so I played kind of a contrast to the to governor candidates as far as taxes and a lot of it has to do with\nUm funding schools um how do we fund we did the twenty twenty percent by twenty twenty plan or the legislature did that the governor did that you support that correct\nVery strongly and part of that I supported and actively campaigned with the governor is one of the state co chairs\nFor the passage of prop one two three [noise] you know people people don't realize that they they won't acknowledge on the left Jeff that we went through something called the great recession mhm which precipitously decreased revenue to state government for all state government services including K. twelve education only knowledge that\nThey want it now governor to see and the Republican majority in the legislature was was very very little democratic support increased\nFunding for K. twelve education by two points seven billion dollars over the last four years\nThat's the largest percentage increase Thirteen points six percent the largest percentage increase of any of the ten states\nIn the country that didn't raise taxes over that four year period so I think we're doing something right under governor to teach leadership beat all we have to maintain a pursuant to the constitutional mandate a balanced budget we've been able to do that we have proven reserves\nAre growing the economy and yet the plan if you can even call it that because they they don't have any other plans but the plan\nThat David Garcia and hop in my opponent put out there of course is the invest in a tax proposal\nThe tax increase on all Arizona's because it does away with indexing for inflation\nSo it impacts all Arizona and it's a tax increase that would lead to them ultimately to a loss of businesses and jobs and the decrease not an increase in revenues for\nState government so I Hope people listening does it might still be undecided I haven't voted by mail vote on election day I Hope they take into account the fact that we are the party that is that stands fall on the side of proven\nIncreases in K ... education spending while also demanding transparency and accountability\nFrom both district and charter schools for real results by all students\nAre you folks Frank Riggs is my guest running for superintendent of public and poor public construction for Arizona it's funny you mentioned the funding levels Frank because that was one of my questions are really to both folks who are running for governor but I hear an echo in a lot that hey we need to restore funding levels for education to two thousand\nReally to most folks who are running for governor but I hear an echo in a lot that hey we need to restore funding levels for education to two thousand eight levels and a big red flag goes up to me look I don't get me wrong I Want funding levels I'd love to see more money in our classrooms to our kids\nBut when I hear two thousand and eight I remember just like you were saying that great recession the bubble and then the subsequent crash and governor juicy explain this very well\nWhich ones have you spent ourselves into oblivion steep budget cuts so bloated so my question asked folks to push the two thousand eight numbers is that was the highest that was the peach\nIs that really your basic should that be your basis\n[laughter] well it it should not be I mean the fact of the matter is that over that decade since the great recession we've added over half a million new residents that resulted in a enrollment increases Seventy thousand more K. twelve students in our schools\nSo we've been impacted by growth will continue to be impacted by growth I suppose [noise] about trying to go back and establish a baseline has created during the boom times under Janet and the pilot tunnel as governor is pure folly\nAnd what we have to do going forward ... is is essential vow that K. twelve funding per pupil funding for K. twelve education will keep pace\nWith student enrollment growth and inflation and if we have surplus funds then we can look at other educational priorities but it's important that at least going forward or prospectively that we make sure K. twelve education funding again keeps pace with the woman growth and inflation\nDo you do an income stream do you do and which means attacks or do you just increase the budget as new dollars are coming in because of increased economic activity you know what I'm saying how do you feel I Do spend\nEither way it's a gentle front obligation of state government which is to say all state government you know all the tax payers\nAnd should continue to be if we have a dedicated funding torture K. twelve education it ought to be on the Capitol aside\nFor for equipment materials you know and and facilities and I think we could do that I I've got some ideas on creating a partnerships public private partnership where we might be able to attract a significant amount of low cost capital\nOf for again invoked shocked at heart capitals needs of our school district in charter schools that would pay\nFor that infrastructure but over the life of that infrastructure in your school facilities are buildings have a useful life of at least thirty to fifty years so we could use a long term dedicated funding stream for facilities but in terms of operation or a year to year expenses that that will continue to be a general fund expenditure\nFrank Riggs is my guest running for superintendent of public instruction how does um there there's kind of been this big almost ... battle between the neighborhood district schools and the charter schools that's kind of grown that tension between\nA within for for some people is how does your office you get in there a way and do you weigh in on charter schools public charter schools is that part of your purview\nOf course it is see you know the superintendent is responsible for administering superintendent our entire K. twelve education system so that includes the Fifteen hundred plus district schools the five hundred plus charter schools educating approximately one point two million students schoolchildren in grades K through twelve\nAnd ... you know it's the way I look at a ... honestly it's all part of one system I want good district schools which are great majority
