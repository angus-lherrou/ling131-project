it's not too expensive but I don't feel like pulling the rug out from under him just because I made a mistake so how would you suggest they handle that\nUm what the select soccer crash\nIt only seven hundred and fifty dollars a year and not put all of his um the uniforms and everything\nIn your household income is what I'm just under a hundred thousand okay and you\nUm uh\nYou have how much debt Seventy five thousand [noise] okay um I mean it's not a deal breaker\nYou have how much debt Seventy five thousand [noise] okay um\nI mean it's not a deal breaker it's seven hundred and fifty dollars for the thing that sharing and I did when we were looking at things like that was we would if we found one thing like that that we were going to not cut to hit our debt free go we had to find something else we were going to cut deeper okay\nSo like that means that if you were going to cheat and go out to eat once a month now you're not gotcha or the if you thought you were going to do X now you're not and in fact jak instead we're doing select soccer\nUm and how many kids do you have three okay and is he the oldest or the youngest or\nHe sold the oldest okay All right and um well I mean you get yourself out of debt and the other kids as they come up and do you can do whatever you want to do right with them in terms of uh you know activities\nIn sports and stuff you can afford to do all of that the thing that we decided was that all of this is for fun\n\nBecause um I mean Daniel my son played ice hockey all the way up through high school we knew at six years old he was not going to play in jail right we we're pretty sure at that point you know and uh so we made decisions to invest in ice hockey to have fun\nRight not because we were trying to create a future career for him\nBut you were doing this as the day Ramsey show\nCarlos ... is with us in Jackson, Mississippi hey Carla how're you\nDoing very well thank you for taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nWell I think ... is that um there's three in the household and my husband and myself and um my dad passed away two years ago so mom on the\nLine with us [noise] so um she couldn't make it on her own so we just kinda combine our income um our monthly income with three of us combined is thirty four hundred and forty two dollars I've done every day dollar budget and we're\nLike forty seven dollars and not over budget as things stand now um\nWe had back in January we had some identity theft going on in our account and that it is almost twelve to Fifteen hundred dollars and ... that the bank to for over a drought this to so that good\nI mean why why did the bank charge you\nAnything if there was a ... to\nBe it well it was ... was charged to our account\nTo know but if it's identity theft of banks shouldn't be charging you anything\nWell they did and they said there was nothing I can do about it\nA rock and changed banks\nYeah we did okay wait we actually\nClosed banking and we just have a debit card that um it's like one of those little Walmart orange you know\nSo we don't even go through the banks anymore\nIt's just a debit card but um they charge us like nearby six hundred dollars that over a draft and they wouldn't take them back mhm\nBut I'm here in that because that was going on a weekend and own our house payment\nAnd I'm ... thanks for the smaller ... we had what we call the smaller nice but we're still have a hand on our house I've got to the house and loan people and they're working with it but we're having to pay extra\nA month on our mortgage payment\nSure how old are you guys\nFifty nine so I'm fifty nine and he's sixty and mom Seventy nine so\nAre you guys on some kind of a fixed income for some reason\nYes it's a disability out three of it\nAnd none of you were able to work\nNo I Do a little side business with crafts and things like that\nWhat is the nature of your disability\nI'm Mad Men is a hip displacement what's wrong with him um he had um a as a broken back uh-huh and he has a um\nA piece of the bone enclosed is nerve mhm and he also had a triple bypass surgery a few years ago when he had to defend their later and mhm so he's got like twenty five percent of his heart beating so mhm okay\nWell what what you guys have more than anything else is an income crisis right due to the fixed income and that's why I was exploring the question that does sound like you've got some pretty serious limitations um but what I'm going to do if I'm In your shoes\nA fixed income and that's why I was exploring that question that does sound like you've got some pretty serious limitations\nUm but what I'm going to do if I'm In your shoes is what you kind of started doing there with the crafts\nAnd even in his shoes are obviously none of you all are going to be involved in physical labor of any kind of crime but if there was something that you could\nDo like I talked to a lady the other day who was just going to garage sales and she was buying clothing for a quarter and a nickel and selling it on ... for a dollar and two dollars and she had done that like ten thousand times and made like ten thousand dollars mhm\nOkay and that doesn't involve any heavy lifting obviously it involves a keystrokes on the computer to set up an ... account and sell some stuff on ... I'm not saying that's what you do I'm just saying that something like that that is\nThat that that is in the line with the limitations that you guys have because if we can add a thousand dollars a month only your world it would change your life\nMhm wouldn't it it will be dramatic and how old is mom Seventy nine\nAnd how much of this thirty four forty two comes from her\nEleven forty yeah\nShe passes away you don't get a real problem\n\nSo we've got to solve some of the income issue one way or another here um and how much is your house payment\nI'm Seventy eight and I think\nThey do but that's that's that's just due to taxes and insurance going\nUp probably Iraq uh-huh yeah OK and what's the home worth\nIt for a ride out of high and dry up from where we don't\nWant to go and yeah it sure would be good when you know\nSo I think more than anything the the the magic wand here is some kind of an idea\nFor you to create some income and I don't know what that is but I Want the three of you to sit around and talk about what you could do a ... you're obviously not going to do anything this physical I get that you got some serious limitations\nI understand that and I'm not picking on you know I'm just trying to help you uh but it man a thousand dollars a month would change your whole life\nThousand dollars a month for a year and you pay the house off\nAnd that'd be rid of that payment and then when mom passes you're not in a problem and right now you being a serious problem two thousand dollars a month income change\nYou feel like you were rich like you were a multi millionaires or something it would change your life that much\nAnd so in is that possible yes that is possible it's very possible\nBut you need some income ideas some things you can do jump and it's

to five five sued to Stephanie is\nStarting all this Rochester, Minnesota Hi Stephanie how are you\nThere thanks for taking my call sure how can I help\nWell my husband and I we are currently I'm doing Davis that number two um but we also have an eight month old daughter\nOut of so we're not quite to the college saving yet uh but we do have grandparents that instead of buying a Christmas gift their birthday presents would like to put away for her college savings and I'm just wondering what's the best way for them to go about that\nUm I Would go ahead and open the child an e essay and educational savings account how much money are they talking about that they want to put in that\nI haven't really decided but growing up I was giving savings bonds\nThey don't really want to do that I Would I don't know if they're thinking like a hundred dollars or you know each birthday and H Christmas I'm not sure okay\nAll right well you can open some mutual funds as little as two hundred and fifty dollars others five hundred no there's a thousand minimum to get them open okay you're going to open an educational savings account in a mutual fund an e essay\nIt requires because the child is a minor that someone be in charge of that you can't be the custodian that would be you\nOkay and then your mom and dad can or his mom and dad can add to the child's educational savings account the only limit is you cannot put a total between all of view of more than two thousand dollars a year into that account\nOK\nYou can and a five twenty nine but more than that but you know we're not talking about that being a problem we're looking at the minimum and you've just got to get some money scrape together to do a lump sum to start the mutual fund you know so maybe two or three people put some money to go to maybe you just put it in a savings account to get up to five hundred and then you open the say\nGreat that there's a lot of help things you\nCan't just check in with your smart vest or pro when they can help you get that done Lisa is with us in Austin, Texas Hi Lisa how are you\nThank you for joining us America ... is with us in Singapore\nI'm doing quite well thank you very much and good afternoon how are you doing better than I deserve how can I help\nYeah so ah first of all I'd like to thank you for everything you're doing a sense of listening to actually have a few dollars truck together great um\nMy question is basically about I'm a ... a voluntary retirement scheme that um is in Singapore so I can put up to thirty five seven thirty five thousand seven hundred dollars a year and that would get tax relief on that\nBut that calendar year ... which translates to about four thousand dollars in taxes mhm now I Want to take half my emergency fund\nAnd put it into that account because I might not reached a thirty six thousand just blowing it out my salary\nMhm what are the penalties for withdrawing or should I Do that one of the penalties for withdrawing I don't\nRemember for sure yeah it's about fifty for a ... percent on taxes are but I I really don't need the entire emergency fund I currently have thirty thousand a month picky picky and fifty thousand a\nYear that I can rebuild my retirement my emergency founded about three months if you don't need it why would you rebuild it I mean I don't have to have all the thirty thousand I just built that because I feel very comfortable with having a cushion\nRight and what is your income a year about a hundred and sixty okay so what is three to six months of expenses\nIs about twenty three thousand okay that would be a three ... that'd be three months or six months that will be fifth month okay All right so you can be within the range of three to six months of expenses at Fifteen thousand and\nUm if you want to use some of that money that's fine and if you want to build it back up to six months later that's fine but it doesn't sound like you need more than twenty five thousand ever in your emergency fund\nYes but I'm not a citizen I hear I'm also not a U.S citizen I'm I work here on my ex patriot and I just feel more comfortable because if I Need to leave the country\nI'm also not a U.S citizen I'm I work here on my now ex patriot and I just feel more comfortable because if I Need to leave the country I have about sixty days to get all my first and order the\nMhm\nOkay so you're just going to keep all electorate will show what doesn't apply to them what happens if that ... that event occurs a while you're down on cash because you've funded this thing\n\nSo it's very unlikely um I just received a new role and at least for the next two years I'm probably very safe at my work life\nMhm yeah\nWell the thing is is here here's what's bothering me is the proper amount to have in your emergency furnish thirty thousand dollars and the answer is no\nDon't drain it down because this is not an emergency you use emergency funds for emergencies period if the proper amount to have in your emergency fund\nWhich means you should end up there is Fifteen thousand twenty thousand then don't have more than that later\nSo you decide what the proper amount in an emergency fund is when all the smoke clears but\nDon't tell me you're using your emergency fund to fund\nThis and then you're going to put it back which tells me you don't agree you know you've got your mind the proper amounts thirty grand I think is what you're saying and so the answer is no don't put the money in retirement\nDon't use your emergency money to do that but if you're willing to reassess your emergency fun and say I've got this thing over funded I'm going to back it down in the twenty range than I might go ahead and do this deal\nA because we're not there but but if you think you need to keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies\nAnd don't monkey with it as merchants you find this is is foundational before you move on to investing of any comment so you got to decide your definition that's what I was poking around on I'm trying to figure out what you really need slash one and it sounds like emotionally given the unusual situation that you're in you want to keep thirty grand around\nAnd so you should keep thirty grand around\nIf that's it don't mess with that but if not if you're going to permanently lower it then use some of that money to do this then hey I'm just fine with that a cage is with us in Salt Lake City Hi cage how are you\nHey Dave how's it going\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nAnd thanks for taking my call today I'm I'm a college student I'm two semesters away from graduating with my bachelor's degree in finance um but the more that I go through school and the more that I listen to you it makes me want to I'm really make a living being a financial ... many years ago and still here today [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I wanted to get your advice on whether you think it still possible for somebody like me to run that type of fitness that maybe your life on the back in this model to maximize success on the early going up starting\nOkay well the um you know the based financial coaching where you pay someone pays you a fee just to sit down and do one on one coaching which we do some here and we go we we have a program where we sort of our people that do that that come through our training to do that\nIs it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that\nUh because it's it's very much uh the inventory is your hours in the day and you have to sell enough of your hours in the day for enough money to equal a good living\nAnd I can be done but uh coming straight out of school difficult to do\nI'm not saying that can't be done but I'm just saying it's not it's not a slam dunk okay it's not an eighty thousand dollar your job your first two years out\nIt's going to take you a while to build up the thing you could do is you could go into the financial services world like on the brokerage side and work with someone like one of our smart Mr prose as an example and those guys are in the business gals are in the business of selling investments\nAnd there's nothing there's there's nothing that preempts you as a matter of fact it it's almost paramount that you do coach people while you're selling them an investment so that they don't get into the wrong investment you're teaching them you're helping them make decisions\nBut in the process of doing that then you know you're making a commission and there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're selling so I'm On a home near coaching them and this house was gonna you know it's going to be pretty you know based on your income is is that really out of your ranger coaching someone if you're a realtor and telling them that you're in a sense your financial coaching them\nAnd so but you get paid a commission when they buy a house\nAnd so uh you know this idea that some people have that everybody gets paid a commission has a conflict of interest and keeps them from doing the right thing by their clients is absolutely absurd there's plenty of people on strike commission with high levels of integrity that do the right thing so you might explore that angle\nBecause truthfully you can make more doing that\nThen you can\nJust doing a book billing by the hour and I'm not saying making more is the whole answer but you know as a as a young guy coming straight out of school as a financial coach you probably don't have to get a little bit of miles on your before people are going to trust you\nYou know I could be I mean there's some people trust you and if you're really good you know you're no you're stuff than you'll you'll get business\nBut ah I'm just saying it's it's a tough road to just do what we did back in the day and it's one of the reasons is not is one of the reasons we quit doing that as our exclusively but we did you know we started doing events we start having a class where we started doing\nOther stuff to go with it uh because it's difficult to make a scale up when there's only so many hours in the day you can bill out at an hourly rate\nOpen phones

Coleman host of the can Coleman shown serious ex him or her Ramsey solutions media\nProductions and thrilled to be sitting in for Dave this hour Tripoli eight to five five two to five Tripoli eight to five five two to five is the number to jump in and let's go to Cody who's on the line in Seattle, Washington Cody how can\nI can thank you for taking my call so I'm\nAbout five years and she my career field and ITN factor security and um I currently make a hundred thousand a year um I completed all of these babies time so I don't have a wife or a cat and\nA and then they have all yes I've been given an opportunity to take a job that is less stable\nEither and in full time and it pays a approximately three hundred thousand a year cyber air to compel thing and uh I've I've been raised with you know try to keep a stable job um you know HBO and\nFive days a week and make sure you know you get your paycheck and um but I think since I'm pretty young and I don't really have you know a ... or family or anything I was just curious what your thoughts were on our either staying at my job or taken this position\nWell let's start with how excited are you forget the stability issue which I'll get to momentarily how excited are you about this opportunity\nIt it's pretty awesome or the or the field itself I I enjoy doing it um I don't consider going to a job but like a chore or anything like that I I I enjoy it so yeah OK opportunity here or the other one is pretty exciting\nYeah okay that's great that's that's one question the other question is when you say stability you said you're going to make three hundred thousand dollars that's a massive that's over half\nOkay two times what you're making OK so where's the stability she meaning that you're not going to have normal hours but you're still going to make three hundred K. that I understand you correctly\nYeah so um I I ... I basically work it out for like a twenty hour work week and I multiply that by the hourly rate so IT consulting so uh you know I can have worked for three weeks and then I can be I have no work for you know months on end\nYeah but you're going to make three hundred ... that's pretty clear correct\nOr not even if I get twenty or twenty hours a week okay got it on the earth All right\nBut is there some question as to whether or not that's going to be consistent is that a moderate goal or can a conservative goal or an aggressive goal the twenty hours a week\nThe question as to whether or not that's going to be consistent is that a moderate goal or can a conservative goal or an aggressive goal the twenty hours a week\n... ... that's pretty moderate um 'cause I I've spoken with some of the other people that work in the position um and then they say that's about average um yeah OK yet but they may have some months or they they get a check em\nYeah but ... this was a no brainer because you're completely debt free you've already gone all the way through baby steps of and you have no wife and kids I mean you're in great shape to take this opportunity and and here's the other thing you've probably planned for it what is your uh three to six month emergency fund look like how big is\nIt the empower them\nYeah I mean juice out a little bit how long would it take you to get up to thirty or fifty you know ...\nWhat by our position\nYeah or just in this new position 'cause you're in such good because you're such good shape you you know just taking a new position you can stack up some money and take you know my point is is let's say you're getting into this new role which you really want to take and I'm telling you to take it\nBut let's say you're killing it the first three much live on way less you already can anyway so the new job is actually going to allow you to maybe put six months away\nSo you've got no risk at all because you can jump back in the cyber security I think it's a no brainer I think you're over thinking it because it's not the forty hour week buddy you did all the hard work to get to the point where he can take a job like this you don't have to work forty hours a week\nOkay you got me yeah\nSo I may be uh celebrate tonight my goodness don't overseeing this I mean half of half of the ... love to be work ... right now [laughter] I mean buddy this is the kind of smart risk you know because you put yourself in a great financial situation to be able to go after this there's really hardly any risk at all um\nMan and and here's the deal you're saying that you all you have to do is get twenty hours a week\nAnd that will put your three hundred K. if you only do ten you're still going to be making about the same it's not even a little bit more of course you'll be making more so again go go go oh that is fun stuff AAA eight to five five two to five just as a career seem out on the day Ramsey show I'm Ken Coleman city in for day to go to Rachel is on line and Madison, Wisconsin right talking about\nHow campaigns like hockey nature I'm I'm twenty four years old and right here in ... working in the legal industry and but I Know I Know

then kind of match together and figure out\nHow to get the borrowing handball traction\nYeah uh everybody in America as well so that going while that's extremely valuable who doesn't want somebody who can do that [laughter] pick the industry\nI mean think about how valuable you are and again I Want to remind you something Rachel I tell my audience this almost on a daily basis here's where we sit right now in two thousand eighty seven million jobs available in the United states seven million\nIt's historically there are more jobs available then there are people who are unemployed and you just

before we receive our\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business\nI Need to get in proximity now the other thing I Want you to do is I Want you to start talking to your buddy other people acquaintances or who dabble or work full time in this space and I think you could probably come up with a list of those people as well\nAnd so you need to take them out to lunch or take them to coffee and you say hey listen this is the ... this is a place I Want to be in\nAnd so I'm here to pick your brain into areas number one what was your past\nWhat are some areas that I could get better and working I grow up what do I need to learn who else do I need to ... do you have any relationships you know of any open jobs this is a very simple conversation it's going to yield something positive\nAnd so this is proximity and then even if there's not a fulltime job available ... this is the this is the part that I Want people to get that are in your similar situation\nLet's say you do all of that and there's not a position that is right for you at the time\nIt doesn't mean you throw your hands in the air and take your ball and go home what it means is you say All right I'm going to practice proximity in a in a non paid situation so I'm going to go volunteer or or I'm going to say can I just chateau you for a day\nI'm going to get in places where some type of audio video production is happening and when you get in those places you will continue to meet new people\nIn those new people will help you get in the right places are going to open up the doors for you so you're on the right track the first step is just talking to your body that's just the first step and that's how you ... practice proximity is people in places\nSo again folks if you're in a similar situation let's apply Nelson situation to you he needs to simply asked today and then start to ride it out and find the answers when he goes and looks on line or wherever and he makes a list who are the people that are doing the audio video production in my area\nWhere the places what companies are doing this and that's what he's looking to connect to

can I help\nBut he can big fan big fan of the whole range of the organization I appreciate all you do thank you [laughter] pay so I'm I'm looking at a kind of continue to she I'm what I'm Wondering\nIf if what I got as a hobby or district careers or just a little bit of a back story of what a good paying job that excellent benefits to pursue at that with my passion\nI take about ... percent pay cut to to make the switch and and as I went to this new profession you know I quickly learned that I don't smoke at the right thing for me I think I might have jumped the gun I just want to get an impact on your\nWell tell me what the profession is that you just jumped to\nFinancial diving what is it a financial diving\nOkay so you jumped into financial advising specifically what are you doing day to day give me the quick\nRundown\nA day to day are basically just knock on TALK stores ... who I Am what I Do and you know try and get them to a young age though that I can help them

and knock on doors like you're doing\nExactly they provide zero lead\nOkay why did you jump into that I mean I I think there's a question you may have jumped too soon 'cause in playing financially but your question was is this hobby level you know it's just the right thing for me and and and and I you know there is a little bit more to it than that I think I have a hunch on it but quickly\nWhy did you jump for this why financial planning\nSo you know I've been with him that day during the last ten years crowded and you know I've always had a passion for maybe that would help folks were the

down and help people with their finances with the problem is you signed up for a door to door sales job that that's what's going on and I don't know\nIf straight commission sales is the thing for you the reality is you need to get some feedback I mean today from your leaders\nAre and maybe some some of your co workers to see why they think this isn't working pretty quickly you got to make a decision or and so maybe it wasn't the right place maybe it's the right thing but maybe it's not the right place because he's got the talent to give people with vice and coaching\nA and you have the desire to do it maybe you're just not in the right format the right setting to be able to do that so we get some feedback reassess and let's get stable and find a better scenario but don't stop

was giving the instructions I can describe it and see to you as a very thin very white pale entity I couldn't see his face all I Know it would very skinny it had a very long fingers\nHow many I don't know how many fingers that had it could have had five it could have had three I just remember one finger because I had the feeling that it was touching me with one finger and it just freaks me out and

or meditate or how they had any insights about water a lot of water affecting the planet between now and twenty twenty six\nAnd that was a year that had been presented to me by a real whistle blower [laughter] the science with said that uh he had worked on a project having to do with this exact time period\nTwenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six\nIn which there could be some either a natural cycle or something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that they're going to be like a shift or a jolt\nAnd that it would cause tsunamis in tremendous amounts of flooding\nAnd I have had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them about exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle\nInteracting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is flood that has written about in genesis\nAnd that is how well and and a complex all of this seems to

is Tony I Would like to tell you about something that I saw as a black child I Am fifty seven now but at the time of the incident I was four or five years old in Nineteen sixty five Nineteen sixty

this very day is retired us air force staff sergeant Tony guy\nOutlived in Dayton, Ohio\nI was about four years of age\nI live with my mother and she had a best friend that she waited two bedroom apartment my mother had two children\nAnd my mother's friend had two children and we were all about the same age it's a two bedroom apartment in its two levels you have to go up the stairs we get to the to the bathroom and I was in my bed sleeping along with my brothers\nAnd two other kids and I woke up in the middle of the night I have trouble going back to sleep and not just in the dark couldn't go back to sleep so I decided to get up out of bed you know went through the window\nAnd I was just looking out the window and it was very quiet bothering yearly cars as how I knew it was very late at night 'cause I didn't hear your car goes by\nSo I'm looking around and I happened to look up look up in the sky you know just looking around because it was really the book a grassy field in between good apartments\nSo I look up and I see a light a bright light in the sky a suit was on an airplane that same light that I was looking at because it was only in the sky\nI noticed something was coming down and by the time my notes you may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet off the ground the light that I was ...\nBy the time my notes it may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet off the ground\nThe light that I was looking at came down\nIt was an or what I noticed about it was one half of it was so white collar and the other half of it was neon green color you know like the glow sticks that you see at the concert when they have the glow sticks to me on green glow sticks right look like that and\nI was saying to myself this looks like a perfect circle but there's so little all is if you cut the perfect circle in half and then just pull it apart a little bit\nA little lighter in the middle then it would have been if it were perfect circle\nYeah and I noticed that word it to light met in the middle the\nShah white lie in the lime green light there was no bleed over you could clearly see where the neon green ended in the fall white began and this object it looked to be as thin as a balloon\nWhen you say he was like a balloon you mean that the surface was translucent and you could see through it\nYeah I could clearly see through it it was no metal nothing like that it was more like a seafood boom so the and it's like you're looking at a sweet super long and what are you seeing\nWhat I'm seeing is a person standing inside the fall white part wearing like down and he's looking up\nHe's just standing there looking up like he's looking up into the bars I don't know what he's looking at but I could clearly see this and I'm saying to myself

brunette hair and it came down to I'd say his shoulder to shoulder lanes mhm and he was just standing there looking up\nWhat his hair straight wavy or curly\nI'd say we're straight dislike you see when you see these motion pictures are Jesus of ... ... it was like that\nWere you close enough to see the shape or color of his I\nKnow I wasn't close enough to see that\nAnd what was the shape of

no I couldn't so how do you know it went down to his seat\nBecause I could see that where the or where he was ... it was at the very bottom of it I could clearly see the whole the year it's kind of

I don't know if the word is dissolve a but transform into gold sparkly light what you were describing it reminds me\nAnd the the people who have had this experience they all say that it is a bit like seeing your skin your body your hand everything turning in to a like very fine gold sparkly dust\nThat is a phenomena that I'm curious about and if anybody listening to Kosovo night knows anything about that specific it's not you're not dying\nIt has a transition that is seen by The Mind's eye that the body is changing into gold sparkly dust but then I\nIn addition that is seen by The Mind's eye that the body is changing into gold sparkly dust but then after they have gone a unconscious\nOr whatever the missing time is they are back alive and remembering that memory extremely vividly I find that also a very interesting and wonder George if you ever heard of that\nWell what's what's fascinating to me is when you think about the biblical pictures that we've seen beans yeah almost all the horrors around there was for lunch with\n... yeah sparkly gold often\nThat's true and what\nIs this and I don't think that it is something being made up I think it is a\nPhysics part of the universe and other dimensions that we have been denied or have never been told or ever educated about\nIt's always been thrown into the bin of miss solid G or something else and that we've got to start looking at all of this in terms of a brand new cosmic understanding of the physical relationship\nBetween the ... the universe we are in it could very likely be a projected hologram you would have to be projected from another dimension\nMore and more physics papers are being written about more and more evidence of other dimensions\nAnd if we cycle it's this so is the important part\nAnd at the moment of death we transition into one or more different dimensions depending upon something having to do with the growth of the soul that not all souls we'll go to the same dimensions than recycling back into matter universes has to be\nA huge and common part of that cycling and we have been left dumb and blind about it\nOur first time caller Steve in Durham I even go into\nA hot Georgia Linda my question is do you think up to Seventy years will Roswell the American people now are really really ready for the truth\nThat will be visiting because if he's visitors had been abducted people it will er during the ... leave it in and was there for us\nAll to be taking people from all parks may be and not returning to the government of food using this national security and back to school in ... there were two books at risk about safety that we would love to go we're okay good\nAt any time into it and yeah I understand your question and I have had to live with it for a very long time forty years uh where I began my first\nInvestigation into animal needle Asians in September of Nineteen Seventy nine and it's twenty Eighteen\nStrange was\nStrange harvest and uh it was a a well received a\nDocumentary it was awarded a regional Emmy uh so I was dealing from a chore as sure as fact based journalism as I could in that film and I had to wrestle myself\nWith the question of going out into pastures often by myself together to issue and and various things at my vulnerable and having to decide within myself that I was going to keep putting one foot in front of the other and if something took me a so be it\nAnd I am still here and I was a to my knowledge never abducted from any of the many many many places on both hemispheres of this planet that I have walked where I have been where Anna mutilated animals are\nNow what I'm trying to do is set a a different lens and framework here\nYes there are animal mutilation there were animal sacrifices five thousand seven thousand ten thousand years ago and many parts of the planet is well those animals sacrifices may have been provoked by the same other intelligence\nThat is today in the twentieth and twenty first century or doing animal mutilation instead of making us line up uh to do the animal sacrifices\nBut what ever it is that is the truth behind the UFO phenomena on our planet earth I Do not think it is singular I think that there are many facets\nI think that some facets are truly allies and if we had not had allies whether they are from another solar system in this universe or from another dimension\nI Do not think homo sapiens safety and would have survived the the last several thousand years without help from something else why the hell does it make itself front and in our face this is who they are may relate to the fact\nThat humans have been abused and misused by a tremendous number I think of intelligence is using this planet and the solar system now\nThat doesn't the fed and humans being cruel to each other and the wars I don't defend that I think death and killing is horrible\nBut I Do have a feeling of compassion for my fellow human\nCreature that we we have never been treated to all the truth about the true nature of evolution of our own selves on this planet let alone other intelligence is\nUntil all of us know all of the truth then animal mutilation and human abductions and all of the facets which seemed very disturbing may not be understand ... be understood in a correct relationship to the intelligence is interacting\nAnd that is why I feel so strongly that we have got to move the entire planet\nAnd break through like and San Andreas fault that's what it's going to be like and that sort of what you're asking\nThe San Andreas fault has to be the

they provided false statements to Congress that'll be interesting to see how that works out I Know what do you think\nOf that are really bad he's had a really bad couple of weeks and I only see that he lie understanding for flushing phony\nHe lost his office space because I guess he's screwed over some of its other partners in legal business and then he also\nUm had to pay the legal fees to the gym like for a million dollars for some other a lawsuit that he was involved and\nNow it seems that this is a a fake claim which I think he lost favor Democrats you really liked him because he was such a vocal critic of Trump ...\nYeah now a lot of people thought that when he brought in Julie sweat next to the judge Kavanaugh thing that people realized that that story was kinda stinky and it's not funny and it almost took away the credibility of Dr Christine Ford because it seemed like it was a pile on and\nThat and so a lot of Democrats are upset with him to he wanted to run for president

luckily bomb a building I mean we can we check with the New York times is saying about this I can now there's of course we all know we all know let's rush to judgment\nKavanaugh was of course a gang rapist and these bombs are clearly Donald Trump's fault okay here's the New York times\nOr none of their devices harmed anyone and it was not immediately clear whether any of them\nCould have wait\nUntil these are ... are very dangerous yeah I mean in fact uh shows the level of sophistication I that's what I heard from CNN these\nPipe bomb show a level of sophistication ... what's the New York times say now I'm One law enforcement officials said investigators we're examining the possibility that they were hoax devices instructed to look like bomb would not have exploded wow now you may uh you may have read the story from the New York times\nIs that why they never gave us really any details on ... ...\n... well you probably didn't get to a paragraph thirty four\nAh that's what I Love it you know you know how you know how like Jewish people read from a right to left we read left or right Mm okay mhm I with a New York times it's like reading a foreign language I like to read the bottom up\nA lot of good stuff towards the end when you get to the bottom you start with the bottom it it it's funny because usually the headline doesn't matter I mean\nAh some bomb technicians who studied photos of the device that circulated on social media suggested the bomb sent to CNN had the hallmarks of fake explosives kind more typically depicted on television and movies rather than devices capable of detonated\nAlmost like a Wylie coyote kind of almost a digital clock was taped to the middle of the plane feature that\nExperts say it's typically shown on fictional bombs in an attempt to ratchet up dramatic tension a buck salary in real life I'm ... in\nFact in fact they go on the New York times in fact bomb makers generally avoid attaching visible clock their devices really cheap\nFrom tipping off they're targeting no about when the bombs are said to explain it was just like a nice little clock they were sending to these people for their death [laughter] that's what I thought it looked at that and you're like that's not a bomb here's a here's a bonus if you survive\nThey all it it got an handler was one hundred percent survive abilities so far on these bombs\nOne hundred percent survive ability\nWe're it is weird now look it could it be a ... I think here's a plausible scenario that someone on the right did this okay someone on the right who really does not like all these figures decided that they wanted to send a message to all these figures\nBut aren't actually or murder they want to scare the hell out of them but they didn't actually want to kill they want to do that at a point you want to know what you could be doing to this country let let me show yet and they're crazy they were wrong Italy horror despicable and everyone they weren't murderers and so they built this to look like bomb if you look on\nI mean you get this example of this on social media all the time I mean if we counted all the death threats and horrible things that you get on social media as real all the time you'd have to have a staff of salads and checking them all out mhm\nYou know most of the time people say crap on social media that goes way too far and that they're actually intend to do it they don't intend on a you know you start to happen to for example Dana lash right like have to take all those things seriously when she was on TV uh she got all sorts of threats on her family and they did take them seriously but like\nAs far as I Know at least no one actually acted on those things thank God right\nSo you have these serious threat that come into public figures often ends and sometimes they don't wind up panning out most of the time right and even even look at terrorists I mean the the amount of ... people in the middle east who say that they would\nUh execute a terrorist attack on on people who are on you know people from another country for example you and I and I said it is so high it incredibly disturbing you almost would never walk outside if you realize how many millions of people will tell pollsters that yes I Would kill American citizens\nHowever obviously they're not doing it\nRight whether it's because they're not capable of doing it or whether there are in reality they just want to send a message or they really don't like them but I'm not going to go kill someone whatever the reason it and that could be the situation here could be the same thing from a someone on the left\nCut again at the end the Jimmy Fallon one more ... Jimmy Fallon is not a political enemies and Kimmel has put himself in as a political commentator so it's really agree just for him but Phelan who is I think there is no ill intent by Jimmy Fallon doing that bit he's friends with Chris Rock writing\nBut the issue here is it on the freaking NBC yeah you can spirit is a wire legally for mentioning it but you're like Jimmy you're going to give Jimmy Fallon the top but placing your network so what\nShe said was weight but if you are if you are holding somebody up if you're if you're making fun of them okay but\nIf you're holding somebody up like this woman who you know with Diana Ross she liked Diana Ross you unlike Diana Ross for the night and she's not making money and she's not making fun of Diana Ross well isn't that what Fallon did actually didn't ask the question teaches ... yeah\n... ... ... you brought up a great point yesterday and I thought about that that we're getting close to we're getting close to Halloween\n... ... the biggest deal in the world was made of finally\nAfrican Americans have a superhero Black Panther finally they have one finally after all this time we've given them superhero and one that actually people want to be ... ... ... yeah the white kids and like you might want to be so if you're white sun decides he wants to be Black Panther\n'em and think that it's now of course as a father I Will\nBe like sorry dude you're going to be surprised to hear this but knew you could not do that\nLike we have no awareness of race but I mean if what he's trying to do is to you know a ... be one of his heroes who happens to be African American and he obviously notice the difference in characteristics that I mean is that a a horrible\nHorrible thing for a child to consider of course not to be horrible of a black person dressed up as Superman\nNo no no not that way if they put on white face as Superman no I mean it seems it seems ridiculous you wouldn't do it because you don't ... I don't feel Silverman is white or black he's just as Superman it doesn't matter\nBut because of the name of the show was white Superman right black lands and try to game I just got this from a an African American a friend of mine who I Am not going to name because I'm afraid that they will be targeted OK\nGlen what about white face\nLiterally this morning my son in eleventh grade said he and his friends want to be white chicks from the movie white chicks\nI thought it was funny but I don't know especially at school and then we'll take what's supposed to be funny or and there'll be overly offended by it\nAnd start this back and forth drama that none of us need uh we live in a white community ah and I literally said I think this is going to come back to bite you later\nI never thought I'd have to tell my kid that from an African\nAmerican [laughter] using [noise] amazing\nAnd you know it may not they're not may not be a backlash for going the other way for blacks dressing and white face that movie came out depends\nOn your hands on the political climate now yeah there would have never been before everybody thought it was funny yeah there would have never been but because of the political climate because people are you know you can't even talk about it this is Ken so what did we learn from Megan Kelly\nDeliveries air even ask a question Zack you care even asked the question here is a woman who is one of the smartest people on TV she is as sharp as the sharpest razor we all worked with her we all know\nYou screw with Megan Kelly and she will cost you to ribbons she is wicked wicked smart agree on ... yeah so here's this woman\nWho is working at a place that hired her and then my theory is they hired her because they thought oh she's a great investigative reporter she's great as a interviewer said get at the time they were in a bidding war yeah she was a huge get as soon as the end they all thought this was going to be great\nThey put her in and then the social justice warriors all in the networking outside the networks like good news how could you possibly she worked at Fox News and then they ... know crap\nWe're ... we're in trouble now with all of the fringe but we thought would be cool with anything that we do now all the social justice warriors and so they needed a way out they have persecuted her persecuted her\nAll the way through so what happens they see this opportunity she's asked a question that's it she's just says well wait a minute is this wrong so here's what we learn\nThat even one of the most powerful celebrities one of the most powerful educated women\nIs so frightened by the social justice mob inside NBC that's the very next day this very bright woman\nWho knows who she is goes on television crying literally you can see it in her face crying she so frightened by these people that she says I I'm Sorry\nI I I've learned a lot well what did America learn America didn't look\nAt I mean this sincerely mean this absolutely sincerely pat\nThey've learned a lot well what did America learn America didn't look\nAt I mean this sincerely mean this absolutely sincerely pat\nStew can either of you give me a note on

right you can either of you give me a non politically correct\nAnswer in other words you can't use political correctness well because people will be upset nope nope no tell me why ... ...\nWell the

to my face he did the exact opposite right after he was elected\nAnd meanwhile Pennsylvania's economy is growing up because they are now ... securing the prosperity of natural gas that exist in their

Pennsylvania\nAnd you see the stark difference between the southern tier which is why so many jobs this is where\nIBM was actually founded now we've lost it thanks to the policies of the Democrats in

ever voted four times for government takeover\nOf our health care which is single payer which could cost the taxpayers of New York this was bragged about by the socialist leaning guy who's just sponsored the bill will only cost the taxpayers of New York Ninety two billion in New taxes on an annual basis\nIt ... [laughter]\nThat's it I'd want to believe what Ninety two billion when we're ready take half your money anyway\n... incredibly ... and then he landed on\n... this is a solution not voted four times

going to support Nancy Pelosi is going to support the impeachment caucus he's\nGoing to try and write and with all these Democrats you never shown any effect on\nHe's never stood up to Sheldon Silver in fact he was picked by Sheldon Silver for the job you get into the assembly now we can't take by Chuck Schumer\nWho brags about it and Andrew Cuomo funny none of them have come to the district to help him get elected but she came to our district President Trump the first time in my home city of Utica New York in ... years we had a sitting president ...\nWell you also had his son Eric there and his daughter a bunker there they recognize the importance of your race and that's why a mom having you on this and the only thing I can say is to the the people up in the ... area in northern New York in that area you this was a district that you can win it's plus a Republican\nAnd you have about thirty thousand more Republicans and Democrats in the district so you have a political edge there the key is to get the vote out because otherwise you're going to end up with a Nancy Pelosi Democrat Nancy Pelosi as speaker and that's going to be a disaster for New York I can promise you\nYeah absolutely and by the way they are raising incredible amounts of money have been talking to my colleagues all across the country the amount of money they're jumping into these racist attracted to see the voters is really I I it's outrageous my opponent is star outspending may\nAlways been a very independent Republican I'm One of the top conservatives in New York\nUh when I served in the assembly and still you know one of the top conservatives\nBut we have got to continue to stand up for our values and be able to witness elections to fight the fight because we've got a ticket to Washington\nWe've got to support the president's policies which are creating unprecedented gains even upstate New York where we have a really tough economy I mean we are actually helping or small business community are small business humidity\nIs about Ninety eight percent of my life to visit says in my region and they create most of the jobs that didn't help his live by Nancy Pelosi that somehow the wealthiest said the only one benefiting it's absolutely false we voted to make the tax cuts permanent and the reason Governor Cuomo is suing the federal government over the tax cuts\nIt's because his wealthy donors want to leave New York because they're not getting the lifeline that they used to get there actually paying more it's all a lie coming from that side and we've got to fight this is this is a tough battle because\nThe Democrats have the money to deceive voters and full they're meant to think even if this guy is somehow a moderate he's not and I encourage everyone to support us get to vote at its most important we can beat the wall with money but we need a Republican voters to understand the ticket out oh it's really really important\nRight a quality attorney or running in New York and unimportant seat this will tip the balance of power one of our thirty seats we've identified on Hannity dot com ... the main\nYou know ground zero seats that will do that will

identify at least some forensic evidence including fingerprints\nWhich which ... directly connected to the person that was arrested earlier today or more about that as the day unfolds here or let's get to our phones as we say Hi to Danny is in Austin\nTexas Danny Hi how are you glad you called sir\nYes listening to you a lot and I have not been any\nPolitical sense whatsoever but these mid terms are on leave me in court to get out and about a ... and you hit on it every day I listen to it and not watching it or not I have I'm\nListening I Hope everyone feels the same way you do is four hundred and thirty five members of Congress every seat is important ... vote for a Democrat you're voting for policy you stay home that's a half a vote for ... in the Senate if you stay home a half a vote for sure if you don't vote for the Republican\nThen you're basically voting for sure I mean it's really not that simple and we'll get the government we deserve\nI've been at this game a long time I've had a lot of victories I kind of loved when we shocked the world than the media\nYou know I see three scenarios that could unfold but I had to say the more likely scenario based on my full objective analysis it would be a split decision whether Republicans pick up houses or pick up seats in the Senate and maybe lose the house of representatives but the house of representatives as well within our power to win\nIf people identified the thirty districts we've identified on Hannity dot com and people take it seriously and get out and vote\nI mean if every Trump voter once the success of the last two years to continue and goes to vote Republican in eleven days then that means we'll keep the house will pick up seats in the Senate and things will be a lot easier in the work will be getting done faster\nIf we don't do that then you know we get the government we deserve\nYou know I've had many ups and downs following political races in the course of my career wasn't exactly happy the two nights that Obama won I especially thought he could have been defeated in twenty twelve alright it didn't happen and you do everything it can to stop the agenda on their side I'm prepared\nFor whatever Nancy Pelosi an Adam Schiff a Jerrold Nadler and Maxine Waters wants to do to the country and we're not going to go away we're not going to cry when not going to be the cry babies like they've been for the last two years and when they try to do things that are detrimental to the country and the president and they want to enlist investigations were going to be there\nAs a backstop to tell the American people the truth\nAnd then some of you will probably regret that you didn't get out and vote this election season so don't wait until I'm telling you what's gonna happen we know they only want Obamacare we know they want to open borders they don't want to fund the wall they believe in open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states\nWe know they want their crumbs back you know they want higher taxes we know they you know they don't they don't really ... they're all things hating Trump all the time\nNot exactly in the best interest of the country to keep focused on that for two years\nBut we'll do our best you know or we can win at all or we can lose it all listen\nAll of us here on the Sean Hannity show we love the dollar shave club dot com slash Hannity and you don't pay

council has suggested for\nIncreases and money for projects I voted against every one of them I just don't want the\nUh city kind of courage city council they have control over that much money they've shown that they're not responsible and that they spend their money any way they want regardless of what we want a current in my ballot Monday\nAnd um I voted against everything that the city council wanted money for although I like some of the proposals like the lone tree overpass some stuff uh I just want to leave with somebody that's going to be more fiscally responsible\nYeah I I I hear your Larry and a great call appreciate that call eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven when I hear that from a lot of people they're just like I'm uh no I just I'm just tired of it and you see\nA where some of the money goes you know I I I talked about the thing going on in Apache County yesterday where this divorce rises folks were you know having fun at restaurants and spending thousands of dollars or it happens and it leaves a bad taste and folks ah mouth because it's your hard earned money uh but ...\nOne of the things I and Larry thanks for that call one of the things layer is talking about was um this overpass\nAnd it's eighty million bucks a million dollars to okay successive by build bridges and then you got to buy the property I get\nThat but plus plus forty million dollars in interest on top of that\nWhite heck are we saving up long term maybe cut some other areas there's millions of dollars they could save a year in just one local government mentioned that everywhere you wonder why we have a Twenty one and a half trillion dollar debt right All right this next call actually came through on our twenty four seven listener line\nEight seven Seventy news twenty four seven eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven and a little background of your has to do with the the minimum wage issue\nBut it has to do with me I actually have a fire here that I got from ... in the mail has to do with our disabled community and the threat and challenges\nThat organizations like a shiny foundation and uh we had the president and CEO or on the program a couple of months back and get that interview at talk with Jeff dot com but they're having trouble here here's what they're saying in last Eighteen months of increase minimum wage\nAt least

direct care positions have been eliminated\nTo entire day programs have closed age group homes have relocated outside the city sixty six percent decline in community job placements for disabled\nWorkers you don't hear that that those shots from the ah a pro Fifteen folks to you but anyway here's what the caller had to say about the wages and it\nWas it or if I'm like myself who said he all ... all of them I mean and again it we owe chunk communities have developmental disabilities\nOut of our our\nOur community that's one of the reasons why the people there to you after her for them is that even talk to you know and then when Carl up it's really that hey if we if region is going to have a lock on or how can that you know\nThings changed they said okay well if\nNot I think what what she's referring to is this was put before the council to change a long time ago\nShortly after the sixteen election and they decided to delay it as long as possible because that can boost the wages high as possible and what they did on top of that is they had fifty cents so Fifteen dollars an hour per per hour wasn't high enough they want Fifteen fifty\nBut I fear if if you don't slow this down though the stats I just read to you and I appreciate that call a are going to get worse unfortunately\nAnyway folks you leave your comments anytime eight seven seven Ninety seven one three

professional office space for as low as one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month\nTo uh this caravan which is not the first and won't be the last uh highlights the insanity\nOf our lack of a secure border and the loopholes in our law that are being taken advantage of every single day there are many caravan crossing over every day uh they either show up with a kid and know that they're going to be immediately released into the interior of the United states\nOr they show up and they say two words I have a credible fear they've been coached to do that so they can get into the asylum system and then be a released with court dates years in the future never to show up again sixteen thousand five hundred last month\nA showed up uh just bringing a child with you whether it's your own or not it very difficult even determine and so this is just so and we've got to close these loopholes we have to secure our border it's not okay for you to just show up and demand for the lead into the United states there's millions waiting in line to do with the legal way\nMy legislation I worked really hard on would've provided thirty eight billion dollars for border security to include the border wall five thousand agents access roads technology intelligence driven operations and the close these loopholes\nSo that our law enforcement was stuck that they have no option except to let them go\nSo they have to be stopped Mexico needs to do more but it's happening every single day I'll be in you must have are all the the city of a mother mayor or a few weeks ago a has had been told that hundreds of people were going to be released homeless basically into his community every single day\nBecause it was exceeding the capacity of ice and others to deal with now some of\nThem NGOs have stepped up but what they're doing is they're transporting them to to thought it'd be like that it's still hundreds every single day this this is not tolerable it's not acceptable to reasonable people\nDemocrat independent a Republican we have to secure our border and closing loopholes and stop this\nUh this caravan and the and the daily caravan that's coming\nSenator urged how how do we how do we get the strict senator and you guys get back to D.C\nRight there just um you just heard planned brilliantly laid out by Martha and I I notice this has been\nAlmost a year ago Martha and I were out walking on the national mall doing I'm One of my rock marches at\nFive AM in the morning and much of our conversation while we were walking with various other participants was about our immigration system and how to secure our borders so I have\nSeen this level of commitment ongoing for many years now with Martha not only was she a protector of the United\nStates as a woman who served in our uniformed services and the United States Air force\nBut that level of commitment has continued on in the United States Congress\nAnd her thoughts and ideas that are highly regarded by her colleagues and buy those of us in the Senate as well she has real ideas and real plans as being someone from a border state on how we need to address that situation she\nHas the foresight to make sure that we are thinking ahead putting plans in place and then executing those plans she takes this job very seriously which is exactly why I Need her in the United States Senate\nOr senator ... veterans' issues most of your served our nation and I thank you for that\nUm you participated in round table on the issue today first what do we need to do a what's real actual plan or that you can get going when you get back to D.C to take care of these folks I mean shock for so much for our nation it and so much has been wrong with the system\nAbsolutely it was great made a diverse group of veterans of different ages all the way from uh just getting out of their initial service to a World War two veteran a men and women are and you know we heard from them the challenges that we're aware of cars were veterans as well\nAbout getting access to care especially for mental health issues tedious the traumatic brain injury that some of our frontline warriors have dealt with a one of the you know one of the women in the room our son who the navy seal a took his own life\nUh she has in the midst of or grief she turned her grief and do a passion to be a voice\nTo fight for others so that they don't go through the pain that she's been through so we need to be a to be more responsive to our veterans and their families and their need is a big bureaucracy ah like turning an aircraft carrier around we pass some legislation like the VA mission act it's\nGoing to streamline their ability to get care in the community and vote with their feet if there's better care somewhere else and there'd be a facility\nBut every single veteran needs to make sure that if they're getting and they they know that if they're getting the run around that they can come to us and we will fight for them in our oversight role in our constituent services role or if it literally take the act of Congress to do that as well\nYeah absolutely and um one thing that I heard Martha say in our veterans round table today is also something that I have shared with my constituents in Iowa and they compare and contrast\nIn our her opponent um who would more likely support of the union workers than our actual veterans and it's our job and Martha and I know that first hand as best friends um ... is our responsibility serving in Congress\nTo protect our best friends not to protect\nThe VA um we need the VA to step up and make sure that they are serving our veterans that is our responsibility veterans first VA second\nYeah Jeff my you know the Phoenix VA was the you know ground zero of the scandal that's actually in my opponent district she was in Congress are Fifteen months\nAsleep at the switch and the media actually broke the scandal she was totally unaware of it and she's been trying to cover her track from her radical passive wanting to shut down Luke air force base and protesting our troops and all that that you're aware of uh but you know he didn't sense than we've had votes\nIn Congress we have one particular amendment where there was simply\nYou're aware of uh but you know even ... than we've had votes\nIn Congress we have one particular amendment where there was simply saying that VA workers being paid by the taxpayer could not use their work time to do union business they can do that on taxpayer time and kids and Senate voted against that but when she was given a joy\nTo support the veteran or support it you know the the bureaucratic workers she chose poorly and supported the bureaucratic workers and I think that contrast is one that people\nNeed to be aware of that I got there back I get my care to be a uh like the secret shopper there I see the best in the worst of it you know the the good people that are that are nurses and doctors who are are providing for our bedroom and there are many amazing people there there's a lot of others and can't get hired a because of\nThat process is so cumbersome that I go on to something else so that process needs to be streamlined\nSo they get the best care that they deserve\nOur folks congressman Murtha much ... going to go since senator Joni Ernst ... urged of uh\nIowa I'm Martha let me ask you this polls are close a this was going to be a closer as a poster on the other day and there was something like ... according to him about Fifteen Percent the shocked me Fifteen Percent of Republicans\nUndecided some of those folks are probably listening right now are they call me from time to time and and mentioned is that they're still undecided what do you say to them\nWell look we're we're trying to win every vote that still out there or whether it's open minded Democrat independent or a Republican\nBut if you're a registered Republican you're a Republican for a reason you believe in lower taxes less regulation and a strong military and a secure border and that's what we are working on right now ah my opponent has worked really hard to reinvent ourselves\nA as if she's a moderate Republican but she's not I just ask them to please look at our path\nLook at our voting record in Congress and do you want to keep going in the direction we're going in or do you want that to stop because the pat you Chuck Schumer being in charge goes through Arizona and so this is a national implications so I asked you to please take a fresh look\nTurn off the TV do the research about each of us and if you if you're a Republican because of the values that we share\nThat what I've been fighting for that's what I've given my entire life to fight for our country and our state and for everyone to have an opportunity to meet their potential and to make sure that our country is safe and secure and I'm gonna keep doing that in the Senate and I'd be on her to have their vote\nOur senator urged last word here you're in Arizona here sporting Martha McSally\nA ... ... what brought you why you something was just so important that the Republicans maintain control and the Dems do not get control the Senate\nWell one I I Am here because that is one of the most consequential right says that we will stay here and the United states of America we are at a and\nIn past really in the United States Senate where\nWe hold a very slim majority as Republicans and we need to maintain that majority away it said uh the stall and done by Democrats when it comes to a President Trump's up white meant it could be our judicial nominations that could be legislation that truly what benefit\nThey set up in the United states and they will stall and block at every turn and every opportunity the maintaining that stayed in Republican hands as well as picking up other states across the United states is a vital vital importance on\nSecond I Am here because Martha as a friend um I Will do everything in my
