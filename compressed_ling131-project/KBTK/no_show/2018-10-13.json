Donald Trump just say the guy's a little evil going a little bit\nIn and she wouldn't budge\n[laughter] I mean just incredible I Wonder what she was really taken by the end of that interview by the way and it's fascinating to do what ultimately didn't make it because lord knows how much they had that they went ahead edited out but anyway uh so talking about the lack of climate credibility at the United nations now\nShared with you really well done um piece from the specter that put in context how wall United Nations has been on their climate predictions every single year for years\nYet for some reason they retain credibility for some reason we subsidize this nonsense for some reason and we know what the reasons are\nAll political it's embraced by those on the left now I think any honest a decent person you are wrong if you're way the heck wrong for your entire professional career somewhere along the way you you have a sense of you know maybe I should do something else\nBut if you are part of the leftist climate science crowd\nYou're gonna keep on keep it on and they're going to keep on federal and your your nonsense and that's exactly what we've seen it's fascinating as you take a look at the entire way this thing came full circle you go back to the Nineteen seventies what was it it was the the global cooling and the ice age right\nDo I uh actually pulled earlier this week and the un report came out in the June twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy four times article that was based on this climate science called another ice age\nAnd then on April twenty eight Nineteen Seventy five Newsweek they published a story the cooling world because that's what was going on\nMan made global cooling\nAnd then somewhere along the way it's like oh crap well that's not working out\nSo then it became what in the eighties and nineties you'll remember what it was remember how every aerosol can every little puff of that hairspray for that big eighties here that was another chunk out ozone layer oh yeah the elimination of the ozone layer\nAnd then somewhere along the way are like oh you know what the sun actually has something to do with the ozone layer and guess what if we actually dedicated the entire effort of this world towards eliminating that we probably couldn't because we're probably not going to be highly effective at taking out the sun oh and by the way some of those are holes [laughter]\nFunny thing how sunspots you know huh [noise] so that went away and then what did it become well as global warming and we got global warming for many years Frank and then\n... not buying it\nSo we go from global cooling we go from the ozone layer to global warming to something that actually Israel is something that's actually real to climate change\nAnd that is how they completed the corrupt circle because climate change Israel always has been always will be funny things happen we've had ice ages we've had periods of extreme heat we've had a minimum of three mass extinction\nEvents remarkably enough before we were even on this planet\nIt must have been on like the the dinosaur watch what you know you know like a cow farts they actually are more political than than like a you know cars so if you just had if you think about it is it the Peter crowds to really think about this for a moment you know if we don't eat meat\nI I mean what happens you care more about the the gal or do you care about or you know your your climate change there because he got you know we're more cows so it's going to happen\nThis is a real moral dilemma you should consider this\nAnyway apparently or what happened was a bunch of Dinah flatulence and I dunno flatulence ended up leading to a mass to extinction events ... it'll be just you know falling off the logic to its natural conclusion you see\n\nOnce again two sides to stories one side of the facts\nI joined backs and will continue to bring them to you [noise] Hi I'm Brian money and for the gray one more a little bit [noise]\n\n\nDo you remember when comedy was great it wasn't wasn't profane and it wasn't worried about hurting someone's feelings well after being gone for far too long great comedy is\nI ah had an idea there's one silver lining that came out a Hurricane Andrew was building codes we\nHave what's called the Miami Dade code that is rock solid you don't do anything but concrete anymore\nIn the affected areas and it makes a difference every now and then you see the pictures Mexico beach you'll see structures that are still standing right next to whole areas that are just completely wiped down nothing but the brain and you'll what's the difference there\nHad an idea that a lot of those homes were built well before we had the Miami Dade standards after Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two went back and took a look at the average home that was built Mexico beach is Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty three\nWell before those standards would framed homes and so the media you is your in one of those types of homes and you're at a point to where you could be impacted by a hurricane\nYou know you you might want to think about your situation or because if you get a hurricane that's like a tornado comes near you you know think about the impact in your home the ones that are standing\nBy and large are your structures\nThat were built after Ninety to whip those upgraded and updated standards it made the difference not only in life and death but it can make the difference in your home being there versus your home being wiped out can make the difference between a community that can be rebuilt and something that isn't even recognizable\nWas mentioning Hurricane Irma last year you go to the uh the lower keys\nYou'll see when you go down there every now and then like huh wow\nIt seems like there's a lot of space where they're used to be homes\nThat's the case there anymore Arabs completely wiped out many of them were just taken straight into the ocean and the and the lower keys were aroma came through and you've got others Mm a couple of shingles missing\nCan be the difference of life and death big big deal so anyway\nOr just a ... as you're seeing these pictures putting everything in context\nA you know you get it was I I think very very much like Andrew in I think we're very fortunate that it went in in an area that was ... as sparsely populated relatively as that area to minimize the damage the devastation where cause because it is real\nBut thank God it didn't go into a place where you had millions of people for example at that size and that strength alright\nAre they talking about some of the financial frauds the climate fraud throughout the course of the show oh we're going to check in Todd wanted to talk about single payer Todd in Ohio Go\nHey

Want to clean up being here in South Florida we had a ton of Canadians especially starting in about a month during what turns out to be our season and a lot of folks come year round for exactly the reason you're talking about health care because yes when you are in that type of environment\nUltimately you're at the mercy of the system and the system ultimately is going to weld dictate unless you end up paying through the nose the exact a different outcome which is why off and people will come here get better choice of care it's funny how that whole thing works or in and let's just talk

removed because essentially what I think that's going on here to Jay as the you've been releasing it by doing these you know really positive things stage\nFrankenstein it's all of these things you know I recommend them certainly but we're releasing them into the atmosphere there's still have to be released from and pushed out from the home in order for them to be out of your life and I think what's going on is that is just accumulated\nA to the point where it's all around you and you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home and this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things\nYou know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work\nAnd to some extent but emotional energy in negative spirits and all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kind of like you know picking the booming pushing it all the dust into the center of the room we still have to take a dust pan\nGets the you know a broom and get it in the dust pan into the garbage has got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening\nAll right thanks for them now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy for\nPeople generate both positive and a ... a negative emotional energy is from the very first day that were born shortage and these things can become trapped in our bodies energy ... also known as the aura but the orders not just a bunch of pretty light\nIt is who we are as part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems have an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is our spirit or maybe three or four feet\nOutside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped over a period of time in just about everybody everybody has the issue\nSo emotional energy this negative that we generate can be trapped in our bodies energy fields and we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's home\nI'm watching TV or you know a pub just every place there is emotional energy and our bodies energy field to be doing to protect ourselves and most people don't\nThat it actually permeates into our energy field and mixes with our own emotional energy\nPositive and negative and causes habit and this is one of the biggest problems that people who call me have it's not always just demonic spirit the idea is is that we are filled full of emotional energy not a positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let go of what we want to let\nGo and so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy negative emotional energy is something that ah people want to release\nI bet they feel a hundred percent better when it's natural\nLet's go to Terry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show Jerry go ahead\nWell uh yeah George or I guess what I'm a student at the original language or the scripture and I'm actually writing a book called the we really knows God he is\nAnd I know he's a Bible in Nineteen eighty big I've dealt with a lot of the body a scene and I was going to ask you Jeffrey\nAre you a Christian I don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in God I also think that ah the argument over creationist a series and a\nTrue scientific physical theories is ridiculous people work hand in hand first principle is creation spirits don't just sit around and clouds and do and do nothing higher spirits angels guide you know they create\nLike the pattern of a cake\nOn a non physical level the design of the universe and then comes the physical so the non physical\nProceeds the physical so the idea that you know creation is does that happen as the universe created absolutely but also the big bang theory why not so it's essentially like I said like baking a cake you know the spirits God angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating in designing these things perpetually right now as we speak not just in the beginning of time but right now and that filters up it's connected with the physical all things physical so each person has to levels\nOf physical body which is very finite sixty eighty years or Fifteen Years or whatever and our spirit which is completely a turtle and our personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that are not that you have but I mean that is\nBeing fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with I'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially swipe believe in all of this is science to me\nYou know and I think that you know God has a personality\nYou know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time and I respect that religion\nAnd so I you know I think when you're doing this marvelous you know I I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation in needless argument between these two are theories that are both\nAnd let's go back to ... for the other question go ahead Teri\nUh yeah what I was going to say is you're talking about religion religion teaches at ... and the guy go to church give your money did they do do that that's not from guy\nThe problem is is that we have many ministers out there that each\nUh this type of stop and basically do they make money off the guy the problem is with the with the whole scenario as it turns me off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know that\nBut you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion it it's it's a relationship between you and God now why is that\nWell the trade or you have to be God man Jesus the title is Jean\n... Lord Jesus Christ Lord Jesus means humanity rite aids anointed why [noise] okay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on the third in fact in fact ... said that\nI'm a I I that God is no respect or person but we're all in the same boat no matter how much knowledge we know we're all the same boat with God because we habits did nature because where where warning stand because of Adam's Dan because we carry out and then\nUh our entire white we we are and and even all that is that that none of it or the glory of God we were all in the same boat\nBut those demons seemed to be every where we're going to come back and take final calls in a moment on the coast to coast am\nGhost insiders the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for I'm ... and now Android for ... listen live we're on demand anywhere any time go to coast to coast am dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nNo one can prevent all identity theft or cyber crime or monitor transactions that all businesses but new life lock the door and security provides more detection and more protection against cyber threats\nGo to life locked dot com recall one eight hundred life locking use promote Georgetown for an additional ten percent off your first year plus a twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with the annual enrollment that's life locked dot com promote ...

California is with us say Thomas\nCharge thank you for taking my call sir ... great work that you're doing ... my question about war and a battle field and Morris um [noise] how tough\nMilitary personnel men and women in\nA battle situation protect themselves from the Monica phone I'm not talking about just battling insurgents luckily but there must be a lot of demonic energies\nIn a war time battlefield situation\nAnd have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves\nI Do I was in the air force myself many years ago and thankfully there are ... there are rules on the other side\nMotion all energy that we all generate and is in the battlefield hatred and anger and fear is killing going on and so it certainly is a a place where negative for tracked into demonic spirits negative spirits as well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up and strengthen our energy field there are methods there are rules on the other side like there are physical rules so there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves to protect us from the facts\nThat negative energy it is generated by other people\nThat's true in the battle situation or emotional energy that's just you know so intense on the battlefield there are multiple layers\nThat can be applied that actually work so that negative energy actually bounces off of us\nThis is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know uh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves and the military you just have to learn how to do them they're actually very simple\nAnd it can you know take\nThis stuff I designed over the years\nWith the help of my spirit guides can be brought up in five or ten seconds\nYou needed fast you know the old style was doing things tend to minutes in the morning in ten minutes in the evening I read all of that stuff when I go to the service ten minutes of the morning in ten minutes in the evening but we need it's very different now it's very different we know we didn't we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us\nNeed to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately in order to deflect negative emotional energy or this being generated by the enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the killing and and also also are off the fear\nAnd you know I think that it's very important\nThat we all learn that this kind of thing and it's a science it's not a religion what ... what I'm involved in is not religion I Would not even to say is really metaphysical is non physical science\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say\nScientists do not call me up and argue with me they are right ideals non physical science which is essentially is the non physical part of our body are emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body that is susceptible to attack\nAnd also negative emotional energy by negative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad and scary situations\nHave you seen demons attack businesses and why did they do that\nThey do it in order to destroy\nA person's life hack the fabric of the family and the best way to do it is to pull out\nThe resources money George to get it out if they destroyed a business and they have a two fold thing going on and they have people that are fired that have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home it can cause people to lose their place\nOr where they live all sorts of problems that can cause them to feel bad and actually react\nSometimes violent Lee and also it has an effect upon the actual business environment we're now you have the failed business I think of most restaurants they fail within a year so restaurant after restaurant comes in her business after business comes in\nAnd you have problems of fields businesses and that has an accumulation of emotional energy as well plus you have all the people working uh who don't necessarily get along is kind of like our our second family we're a family at home and we have our family at work and everybody doesn't get along\nAnd so essentially have a lot of emotional energy people at work were sitting at their desks and maybe thinking I really hated here when they're doing that they're generating emotional energy\nAnd it can it can be positive or negative emotional energy but sometimes it's negative and accumulates in the environment this also attracts negative spirits and demonic spirits because if they can get somebody fired by\nYou know doing or saying something\nUh you know inappropriate or a you know simply not doing their job or she'll be destroying the business itself by making of a the business atmosphere very uncomfortable emotionally\nEverybody's got a story about walking into a living environment a pub or a business or restaurant and saying you know what this place doesn't feel right\nWhat they're picking up on George is emotional energy\nWhether it be good or bad that's emotional energy they're picking up on\nEverybody has the story of that this place doesn't feel right is emotional energy and it needs to be clear it out so they attacked businesses because they can actually make a business failed you might have two hundred or two thousand people out of work\nAnd now they're really unhappy they go home and there are arguments with their significant others with their kids\nAnd a and then it just snowballs\nNext up let's go to the Monique and sun ... son ...

things like that\nYeah\nIn in line with you know and I read the piece about the revolutionary war a before we started the show are you saying that you would use your firearms to defend yourself against a gun confiscation program\nI Would use them\nTo defend myself against a program unless they actually made a change to the United States Constitution they're off and then I Would have to leave the country I don't know where I Would go at that point but until such a change was made constitutionally\nMhm I I Would be forced to so\nOkay I mean and and just I'm asking you understand what I'm asking because that's a serious statement it on you know and some people say that I don't know I actually thought about it through understand what you're saying is I Will go to war over this with the understanding that I Will very likely be killed\nOh indeed and that would be a civil war as opposed to work to be between the states because the previous civil war was not one that will say well between the states because constitutionally you were put under two different states\n[noise] and but this would be basically defending yourself against the the government or government run amok\nAgainst tyranny yes certainly\nThere it is All right thanks er I appreciate that a mile line for students with is that a Camilla, Georgia hey Stu your own guns on what you got\nYeah yeah I been

answers on the number you can call to reach vora and the team is nine\nTo wait two to six eighty two fifty five that's nine to eight to ...\nTalk and ... today we're going to be talking about the stages of retirements because retirement can last a long time three four decades sometimes\nIn the in that amazing because we've had this conversation you know when I first started in the industry twenty seven years ago mhm\nLife expectancy back then was about Seventy three Seventy five you know I'm In today you know people are living well into the nineties gosh yeah and ah you know I have clients uh we're in the eighties and you know we always sit down and talk and they go well gosh you know\nSo we're going to live this long but then you know they also feel that we didn't think we were going to feel this young either you know so and that's kind of a great thing because I guess the sixties is a new forties [laughter] since the eighties is in the sixties though you know with modern medicine\nA and people more aware and more active you know they're living a lot longer range more active so\nThey are more active I think I've told you this before my eighty five year old grandma where's the fifth pitch and she still lives at all no way you feel takes classes like art classes drives yourself around and I think it tells you this what she turned eighty five\nIs there was a little old lady who attended her birthday party who was already beyond the age of one hundred to talk about stealing grandma's thunder\n[laughter] that's right you know oh you're eighty five you're just a child for exactly as I said that since it's\nSo great that'd be kind of how long people are living and because of how long retirement can last I mean if if you are living into your nineties or age one hundred ... you're not working a part time job more than likely [laughter] at that age you need to be prepared for this financially and\nFor so many people because retirement last so long it unfolds in stages where we have those earlier years where we are more active\nWe have those years toward the middle in the end where we start to slow down a little bit and then the final phase of retirement and each one has some different things to prepare for your arm is why do you think it's important to break down retirement into these different stages\nYou know I've always said [noise] you how to eat an elephant and it's a bite at a time 'cause ... times people get overwhelmed\nOr when they look at the bigger picture and they go oh my gosh you know I have to plan for all this so you know when I start working with people I actually help them understand that there's actually three big phases and today we're going to focus on one of them but you know there's the accumulation phase is when you're young you're putting money away and you're starting out\nAnd all the way up to pre retirement you are and what we call the accumulation phase and from there were like pre retirement years you want to sort of think about creating what we call a preservation strategy meaning you don't take as much risk as you are taking when you're younger\nYou're listening to the retirements roadmap show fund the retirement used that word [noise]\n\nWhy she was more financial handle your retirement because we provide objective advice and concierge service investments insurance retirement planning all in one location we also partner with qualified attorneys and CPAs\nTo provide complete financial strategies for our clients we use a variety of investment in insurance products to custom designed retirement plans they can get finds a way to look at their future and we help you stay on the path towards financial independence [noise] if you don't want to do it yourself and want to work

from some TV show host who doesn't know anything about your own for a financial nine to wake up to six eighty two fifty five\nWere not permitted to offer and no statement made during the show shot constitute tax or legal advice you should talk to a qualified professional before making decisions about your personal situation investment advisory services or offer through borer financial roof PLO see I'm registered investment advisor [noise]\nThis is the retirements roadmap she'll find a retirement views network [noise]\nBack to the retirement roadmap shell Howard vie for a financial grill\nAnd generally jacket and pleased to be here today alongside ... he's owner and founder of Laura financial group they serve families across northern Arizona you can find them on line at vora financial dot com that's Laura V. as in Victor Oh our a financial dot com\nAnd damaged part in it for you do have realistic expectations for income in retirement\nOh it's paramount because you know with the one of the things we always run into is that you know I was asked people have said you know you're making say I'm just going to use an example so that so you're making fifty thousand a year and if you're going to retire your incomes going got going to drop down to thirty\nAnd you know what is your lifestyle looked like I mean do you still need the fifty thousand in a lot of times people say you know what thirty thousand I can I think I can live with it and you don't usually when people say I think I can live with it ah I actually it concerns me and the reason being is\nYou know when I Do my personal finances and I I really think I'm not a spender and then I realize the amount of money that I'm spending on things necessity\nAnd it's a lot higher because when you eyeball something versus you really do the math or two different things and so we actually tell people that they should consider doing a test run so if you're planning on retiring\nI Would say and if you said you could live on thirty thousand a year so let's play in that and let's do a six month test run\nBecause what that's going to allow you to do is tightened some of the screws on the engine right to make sure that if if there are certain things that we can adjust where you can live on thirty thousand a year that's one thing I'm consumption\nPeople have to tap into their retirement account and what is the realistic expectation that you're how much your money should be earning\nA their financial advisors they you know have recommended ... you know estimated that you should be earning seven to nine percent\nI personally think that's a very high number\nAnd because what happens is when you were getting into the preservation stage your your have your money is going to work is also going to change because I always tell people that said you know when you're in retirement and if you're investing like you're twenty eight years old or thirty five years old\nAnd you're taking that kind of risk and most people don't even understand that that that that they're taking that kind of risk\nAll they're looking at is while I'm making all this money they don't understand when the pendulum swings the other way what kind of you know I've always said you know pendulum swings both raised writes if you're just visualize a pendulum when it goes up it's pretty because you're making tons of money and you're happy you're returns are great for you is growing all that\nWhen it goes the other way if it actually turned into a wrecking ball you know gosh yeah you do right into your portfolio our job is to help her clients sidestep that by\nMinimizing in understanding what the risk is and in retirement if you made less money\nBut you get to keep the money that's a good thing you know you know this is not the time to get rich this is the time\nTo protect and preserve and make sure that your withdrawal rate what you're trying to take out of that account is realistic uh also to the growth you were having because you want to make sure that your child in a new growth rate\nAware if if you're making not enough\nThat and you're taking money out they could start invading your principal and that's what we're trying to avoid\nAnd you know we've always talked to her clients and said listen if you start with a start out with a number and based on your withdrawal strategy\nIf you can hold that number steady over your lifetime I think you're in a great place but when you start cutting into it you know that starts depleting fairly quickly and you'll run out of money before you know it\nAnd I talked to a lot of people that are very concerned about the Social Security and not being there and I don't have the answer for that I'd like to tell people it will be there because so many Americans depend on it\nBut we don't know what the future holds and we don't know who's going to be in the office and how the Congress looks at it and what our debt looks like and uh you know we're already and Chileans in Chile and seemed to have a country\nAnd um you know these are the kind of thing so you you want to really be self sustaining rather than having to depend on other people for income\nI've had I've had people with pension plans um they've come in and they moved to Flagstaff and you know we were looking at their pension and it was about six months ago you know they came in at what am I a prospective clients came in\nAnd he said I just received this letter for my pension company which is that they are going under I don't know and so there is a what's called the pension guarantee fund but uh you don't get a hundred percent replacement\nSo because they're going under they ended up receiving a significant less amount of money so you know these are the things I'm not saying this is a scary it's an awareness thing and people should be aware because you know you stick your head in the sand it doesn't mean the problem is going to go away you know\nGarish we're talking today with Josh more he's the owner and founder of for a financial group if you have questions about some of the things we've been talking about maybe you are concerned that you don't know what the backup plan is if you happen to get notification that for not your income in retirement isn't going to be there as we were just talking about\nNine to age ... cheese steaks eighty two fifty five\nAnd nine to age cutest chick eight to five five or nine too late to choose sex talk to reach ... ended team at for a financial group\nGarnish how do you help somebody planned for some sort of a shortage in income or some sort of gas whites gave inheritance isn't going to come through this tension is going to be what you thought it was how do we plan for all those big unknowns\nLike is the first thing so let's assume if I'm sitting down with you and your husband and we're sitting down and talking first um I Would let's say you're in pre retirement stage and you're not there yet but if you're in pre retirement stage\nA that is the time I highly recommend I mean people should have a financial adviser period and a good financial advisors going to help you through your accumulation to the preservation to the distribution phase and you do you maintain that relationship\nBut if you and I were sitting down with your husband we would be talking about what does your pension looked like if you had a pension what does that looked like because a lot of people don't know\nWhich option to choose in retirement for pension benefits or I run into people that had made decisions on their own there so this is the highest rank pension benefits and what ended up happening was the elected the wrong pension benefit meaning that they are the only person that was going to receive it\nAnd you know unfortunately you know if that person died\nThe surviving spouse gets nothing oh no oh go ahead you know and if people have done that or they picked an option where the surviving spouse gets about sixty percent of what they were getting\nIn the problem with that is the surviving spouse is still going to need income mhm and you know that that is a really poor place to leave someone that you love if you don't love 'em than pick the first one you know [laughter] I'll just get here this is Joe [laughter]\nBut you know everybody that he is married and in cares about their family they want to make sure that the surviving person goes that surviving person\nHas adequate income of course I'm also with Social Security benefits you know when do you take it and\nYou know what is the best way to get Social Security benefit because one of the things that we also run into is that when people are electing Social Security auctions the ... which is the right one and so we actually use software and reduce implanted with replies show which is the best option for them\nAnd I want to take a step back and just say the reason or show is called the retirement roadmap show is because we planned it you know this is retirement to us is a journey that journey that you've never been on before\nSo there's a lot of small moving parts that most people don't realize that we kind of take that into consideration I mean twenty seven years in this industry I mean we've you know we've seen it all we've done at all and so we kind of help put the pieces of things that people don't even think about\nInto play and show them what that's going to do for them how to take the best option their pension how to select the proper Social Security benefits because people don't know should I take it as sixty to do to get at sixty seven to eight to Seventy\nWhich feels counter intuitive you want to help your kids but you can't help them if your incapacitated\nCorrect and so part of the planning a is understanding where are you money's going in once you understand what that is going\nAh it makes life a lot easier so you're not just him pulse of le going out and spending money on something that you need but you can plan for those things and it doesn't take that long for me to sit down and help you do that but it's important that regardless\nYou use me do it yourself or get a program on line whatever it is but having a plan to understand exactly where the money's going to be ... that's going to be extremely important because that's going to lead you into your retirement spending is going to look like and what's funny and what's not fun\nRight right if you get started on this retirement roadmap west ... and the team at war financial group nine to age ... cheese steaks eighty two fifty five is the number for your call again nine to late ... eighty two fifty five or nine to eight to ... talk\n... let's talk a little bit about how we can manage risk heading into retirement so many people are so concerned about volatility and what could happen next in the markets how do we manage that risk\nYou know it's very carefully getting there is actually you know the retirement roadmap plan by the way we didn't talk about a bill collector that you'll have a retirement which is the IRS\nOh yeah they're ...\nThey're going to want the peace I mean if you're inefficient\nYou going to pay the highest tax dollars the highest amount in taxes and you know working with a professional that can actually help what we do we help our clients create an income planted retirement understand\nWhat their tax pictures going to look like now one thing we did talk about is that two of the largest assets my clients have is their home in their retirement accounts\nThis money in retirement account has never ever ever been taxed before when you take a penny out of that account it's taxable Mm maybe taking more out of it is going to be more taxable\nBut here's the other kicker about the debt collector the IRS not only is going to tax that portion of your money but depending on what your income is in retirement up to eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits could become taxable and originally when FDR\nPlanned this you know signed the bill for Social Security your Social Security benefit was supposed to be one hundred percent tax free not anymore\nNot anymore you know so so those are that that's one aspect of of you know that's a big part you know that's a big bill collector that's worse than having a mortgage but then we talked about risk management right so when I Do a retirement roadmap plan for the people that I'm working with right\nWhat I'm doing is I'm really identifying how much money they need to earn as a minimum\nIn order for them not to run out of money in retirement take into consideration inflation taking into consideration there Medicare part a and B payments\nPart B and supplements and all that are taxes they may have life insurance they may have long term care and all that stuff so we're planning for those things and you know one here's one thing I find\nThere's so many people that I come across do not have life insurance or any kind of long term care benefits in retirement so you know realistically if you don't have any of this and people that are healthy don't think about those things unless they have personal experience with their family member but\nThat's a significant amount of potential hit that your portfolio may end up taking we're going to talk about that\nA little bit later on but here's what I Do\nWe're trying to create some risk free strategy against the risk versus risk free meaning that part of the portfolio we want to make sure\nIsn't impacted negatively should we have in the correction because we've been in a significant bull market since OCE seven or eight mhm and you know we're you know people I talk to their all nervous because you know there's something bound to happen\nAnd is the short term volatility where you have a twenty thirty forty percent correction in the market and the reason I called a short term is because you know it's it's about six months you know ... you know the markets had lost fifty percent of its value in the past\nAnd it's taken six seven years to get it back so the short term volatility has a long term impact on people's portfolio and if you aren't paying attention to that that is what's going to make another way you're going to run out of money in retirement\nIf you're concerned about your current situation and we'd like someone to sit down with you and most likely it's going to be me so call my office at night to eight two to six\nEight to five five it's nine to a two to six talk or you can reach us on our website which is ... and Victor or a financial

about one of the huge risks for retirees and that is health care costs and long term care we can't afford to let that just wipe out when we get in retirement\nAnd you know the funny thing is just joking around and that I told somebody has said you know I Know that you know most people that I talked to they just kind of lived life you know the nutrition and balancing of carbs against your protein and all that that I Am new to all of us right it's like I Can't even tell you from eating causes are\nProtesting anymore [laughter] so I always tell them as if this body has never been treated like a temple\nSo I just know that there's going to be potentially significant medical expenses\nYou're not allowed as I age him you know it's sort of like a if there's an old saying bad guys take better care of their vehicle then they take care of their health this is true this is true right and so in not to say women don't but within everybody you know sort of like we live for the moment and you're calling and I\nYou know we were on vacation and we\nAnd coming never eats like doughnuts and stuff like that but she's like oh I'm going to have a donor because I'm On a vacation Slayer James yes for sure I'm right and I and I think you know we tend to do a lot more\nAh rewarding ourselves for things by spending money on things or you know like buying things and so forth but here's one thing that comes into play when you retire and we talked about the taxes we talked about income we talked a little bit about how to manage risk\nAnd how to make part of your money a risk free and ... will have risked so you're tapering down you risk\nYour golden retirement is to preserve right preserve what you have to maintain a good lifestyle and make sure this money last you and your spouse\nBook lifestyles and at the end I Hope that there is some money left over\nTo pass on to your heirs because if you think about if you are right now retired or thinking about retirement and getting near to it you know if you think about you have Social Security you have potentially a pension yet employers they're generous enough to you know I have four one K. plants where they did matching and so forth\nYou know small employers don't have that ability they have the ability they don't have the finances because you know a lot of things are changing sure and uh you know the new generation really is going to have a much harder time in retirement and they won't be retiring into until they're Seventy five years of age or older\nAnd you know the thing I always look at it is that you know today living has gotten very expensive like you know markets in ... you know real estate has gone up quite a bit because you know down south which is what a recall you know Congress can't for
