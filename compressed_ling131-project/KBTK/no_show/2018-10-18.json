goes you read\nSome article about alpacas were making people rich goes or not I mean any more than any more than cows are making people rich cows make people pretty poor all the time and some of them they make people rich but it is as do other running a business um called cattle\nYou know and it's a business and when it ceases to be a business just are to be a sad um or never becomes a business

work at a truck driver and I'm never home so I'm trying to find out later in life like retirement mongering won't be a good idea on how to invest that extra money I have to put my house in middle age now you know that's a\nGood good question how old are you a fifty four fifty for near single\nOkay and how many years do you think before you buy a house [noise] um I'm thinking oh he's sixteen\nOkay All right cool well as long as you got more than five years I Would use a simple gross stock mutual fund or a series of them\nFor something like that I probably would just using the F and P index fund because it will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out I as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cash it in\nAnd so I started to uh go to ... five hundred fund an index fund and use that to grow for the next five ten years or so until you buy a house as long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market\nAnd you should be fine\nIn that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar thing Scott and sometimes I've got some extra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment\nAnd um even if I don't have five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and because I can afford for it to go down and if I mess up a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Ravi is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick question uh so I Am a nurse or by profession and my wife is a nurse and that that I Am wondering if I should go back to school again next year\nOr so my question is if they work for me to go to a call now I'm thirty two years old my wife\nUh twenty nine we make a combined income right now after a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand\nA year or so if I go to school it's going to cost me ... years of not working\nOn that tuition of around Ninety thousand dollars mhm uh but uh our gross income after I go to school and be successful together would be close to a three hundred thousand mhm\nSo uh but it's a ... year now\nUh right now around Seventy thousand\nOkay you're saying this is going to cost you a three hundred grand three years or three years of Seventy thousand missing plus nine out of pocket yeah okay can you cash flow than on the out of pocket and can you live on her income while you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school um but I don't think I can catch anything right now because I and I also don't have a house mhm uh at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house\nOr or putting at least they're putting a down payment for a house next year before I start school so\nThat then you need to wait until you can pay for school\nHouse ah or putting it leads to putting a down payment for a house\nNext year before I start school so that then you need to wait\nUntil you can pay for school I Would never in Thirty years of doing the show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school\nOkay you got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter of when you do it and what you put first what you put second you might plenty of money to come up with ... grand yeah plenty of money and you don't have to have the whole money up front you just got\nTo see in your budget how you can cash flow it um I can see it pretty easily ... how long does it take to go through the clash again or go to guy ... ... it's a three year program so thirty grand a year\nOr thirty grand a year yeah uh and and she makes what she makes a hundred and fifty thousand you can't cash flow thirty grand out of a hundred and fifty\nA law not when I'm not in coal\nNo if you're in school she makes a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in ... thirty thousand over a hundred and fifty to go to school year for three years\nI I'm Sorry fifty thousand it it's a it's gonna be around a sixty thousand a year I thought you said it was Ninety thousand I'm Sorry I I got that wrong it's it's a sixty thousand a year\nSeems high yeah it it it it it is an expensive program yeah go to a less expensive program that\nBut cash flow it whenever you're going to pay for it figure out what to\nPay for it if I usually go you don't necessarily have an all star stacked up ahead of time but you got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend you go get student loans because here's the thing everyone starts that program doesn't finish it but every one that takes out student loans just aren't that program has on student\nLoans or whether they finish or not and then you've got what's known as a freaking mash and so I'm not suggesting you're dumber you can't pass the test or something like that but life happens do in the last thing you want the only time debt works as if everything works other than that that doesn't work and\nSo we tell you to stay away from it [noise] thanks for the call\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Joshua is in Dallas texas Hi Joshua how are you\nI'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nSo basically I Am stuck in between whether I should fall for bankruptcy or to go ahead and\nStart paying 'em all my at all um goalball basically all my debts except my car are in collection so that's why that's the only reason I'm basically contemplating um bankruptcy why are they only go actions\nUm they're like oh medical bills I'm One of the ... is a car that guy I'm ...\nI lost my job and I think I think like a phone bill the narrative mhm\nOkay so how much is the repo bill\n[noise] I'm actually only like a couple of grand ... it gets what I have on there is\nA Ninety five thousand four hundred and forty five dollars from an old apartment mhm how long ago it was a three and a half years ago\nOkay and how ... how much how much money and when their medical data again\nI Would say about two thousand\nAnd one of the doubt if you go\nTo the rest of it is it makes it very well like my ... a ... I think a phone bill and oh it's a payday Lowe is well you know\nSo your your total that's less than twenty thousand dollars\nRight and then I have um my car which is a twelfth out mhm okay and what do you make it here\nI'm a little bit old for forty five I make a thousand a week I'm a independent contractor\nMhm and you're single or married you're married or\nI'm twenty eight on Saturday the happy birthday does she work outside the home um you know she stays at home and takes care daughter\nOkay yeah well\nLet me tell you what I'm hearing okay and I think I'm hearing maybe I'm wrong I'm a ... cat used to say that debt is not the problem which is a symptom\nOf something else that's going on I'm right and it sounds like you guys have never told your money what to do you've never had any savings for emergencies so every time an emergency comes up you get thrown out of an apartment so your car gets ... and you end up with a mash\nYes they're so we've got to get you on a plan where you are telling your money what to do or you're going to be back here if I waved to want to ... go way which is what bankruptcy might do maybe I'm if it did that make you have zeroed out all of a sudden except your car\nIf you don't change the habits that causes this mess in the first place you'll be back right where you are someday do you agree\nYes there you know so we really need to get on there that says bankruptcy doesn't solve that uh you got to solve that in the mirror you and your wife learning how to handle money I don't think you're bankrupt I think you're scared disorganized don't know what to do and have done nothing so far\nI think you can probably settle that old apartment that for three or four grand if you saved it up and offer them a lump sum settlement uh I've\nI've actually called them a multiple times where I started listening to you that was like one of the first videos that I was looking up with how to get that collect bears you know from under use\nIt don't it doesn't change my answer to whether it's nine thousand and three thousand you're still not bankrupt\nIt's still about you getting control\nAnd when you do that then you're going to see your way through this bankruptcy is not a problem that you have your from Scott\n... is a total money make over both read that take an extra job sell everything in sight and let's get this message cleaned up I'll show you how I was like\nUs today Ramsey [noise]\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my

believe the percentage of millionaires in the study that we just did a a word in the military for Fifteen or Twenty years at the twenty year mark and other second career sometimes sometimes they were career military all the way through\nAnd um they use sometimes a twenty year military retirement and then the second career on top of that ... to them into serious ... so you guys run a great position

had taken the time I ever have half a year and she had to file for bankruptcy and now she doesn't know how to manage your money\nJust to kind of no she doesn't know how to her that she just won't do it\nExactly and I think I have to have surgery on her ... and she's kind of ... because she kept our economic ... actually kind of half a day I got kind of her paycheck and the county that she can't maintain that second hand watching it on today\nMhm\nWhat's ... what's the surgery on the wrist\nCan't I'm kind of I kind of thing that's very painful and passion that I have to have it right now how long have you been there\nAnd how it for about a year now okay All right well I think this was her wake up call\nOkay I think it's time for her to stay at work long enough to build up enough pay pay in a savings account to be able to survive the time that she's off while she's on if I'm LA\n\nOkay I mean what I mean what if you weren't there weren't there to bother stronger drink\n\nThey wouldn't be able to drink right if you weren't there I like to buy her her drinks she wouldn't be getting drunk\nRight when you finance firm misbehavior you ensure it is going to continue okay does that make sense\nI don't want her to die or something I'm trying to get business things cancers and it's going to cause or hand or something but it sounds like\nThis woman live from one crisis doing other than their own self created\nBack and you know back in time and I thought I was reading it in the mail but I wasn't sure\nSo I'm Glad I understand and I'm not trying to be lacking compassion I Want to be compassionate but continuing to assist her in this behavior line that has been destructive to her is not compassionate\nOkay can faint like\nMan I tell you what I don't know I mean you got to sit down and figure out how you're going to do this in layers but maybe you maybe you assist her partially in return for her engaging in behavior that you know she's supposed to be doing\nOK but so far she has refused all help that has to do with harsh lightening up yeah I was a little kid my dad used to say straighten up and fly right you ever heard that\nI don't know what that means I don't even know what that means I just knew we'd better straighten up I never did flies or I don't know what he meant but I didn't slot right you know but you know what I'm Talking about straighten up have\nYou know yeah and\nI and I did I mean 'cause I he he would've looked as if we didn't do what he said so you know but um so so that in this case we can't do that kind of stuff but but I I got to just think that's what needs to happen here for her own good you're I provided whether ...\nBecause you love her because you love her and you don't want to see her in pain and she refuses to do the things she calls the pain to go away\nMhm okay\nAnd you're more concerned about her behavior than she is so I ... I think\nI just sit down and tell her all that say you know I Love your somebody say when you do all that she's going to get pissed off injury\nAnd here she feels entitled to your money back now you know that's weird ... violation in the book boundaries\nMichigan titled or your money because she was\nHere to take care of your mom cigarette hanging out you're living iron lung in the closet I mean come on\nSerious momma\nThis is the day Ramsey show\nGet asked all the time about what people need to do to improve their families money situation to the most overlooked things are term life insurance and disability insurance both plans to make sure that you have income to pay bills\nAnd take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen preterm life you need to carry ten to twelve times your income and I recommend Fifteen or twenty year plans for most families stay away from cash value\nLife you need to carry ten to twelve times your income and I recommend Fifteen or twenty year plans for most families stay away from cash value our return a premium plans there just a rip off\nDisability insurance is justice critical how are you going to pay your bills you if you're unable to work disability is the leading cause of bankruptcies foreclosures\nThat's why I send you to Zander insurance they've been helping my listeners find the right plans at the lowest cost for almost Twenty years call eight hundred three five six Seventeen Ninety or visit sander dot com and compare online that's eight hundred three\nFive six Seventeen ID or Zander dot com\nThat fifty two percent of Americans have less than ten thousand dollars saved for retirement [noise] if you're in that majority retirement may sound like a hopeless situation but it doesn't have to be my name is Chris Hogan\nAnd I want to help you harbor pass your dream retirement we have to start thinking that retirement begins at some magical age like sixty five or Seventy retirement begins when you have enough money to enjoy the lifestyle you dream about\nIt's going to take more than a dream that\nYou have to get serious about making a plan I've created an assessment tools that helps you know what you need to do to reach your dream return get your free assessment that Chris organ three sixty dot com\nWhat your goal is to live comfortably traveled the world or have enough money to help friendships with college and to be able to get like crazy you can reach the number you mean it just takes a plan ... to ... dot com to start making your plan today\n\nHey Rachel Craig here with the gift ideas for kids you'll feel good about giving juniors adventure about the new ... new colorful illustration and a shorter work count\nTheir stories are still find that kids don't even know that they're learning valuable life lessons but it's a senior and that's my favorite banker only to give a gift that mean something that year you'll find junior and the online store at ... dot com or call it the trip light ...

question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has said well he always says in the ... situations I eat as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course\nSay yes it is it still has its mission it's still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says

I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious\nPeople get the idea of the UFOs might be demonic\nAnd there were a lot of folks that believe that\nYes and and it's\nIt's frustrating in a sense because and and it's almost combing Klee ironic in another way that that you know you have a bunch of people\nIn in the Rio de da da and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense had a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon and we should be\nInvestigating it researching it in the proper scientific manner and we come up against skepticism and you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect 'em\nThat skepticism isn't the sort of Nicole or intellectual\nA humanist skepticism that I think most people\nI associate with that concept it's actually it's a deeply trying to believe driven skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the Pentagon um\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic well it's just in one sense it's swapping one arguably fringe belief for another so from wheeling these pay these people wouldn't skeptics told they would\nI Know about title fraud so I register with home title lock and discovered some he's had already taken over title thank God I found out in time\nNo bank identity theft program or insurance protects you hope title luck will for any day who died a lot to barrier around your home title in mortgage the instant it detects tampering there on helping to shut down\nBy now if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar search free which is at home\nTitle luck dot com home luck dot com\nNinety seven only one who does more stimulating talk boosted toes Ninety seven point one the the more stimulating talk\nWill come back to the cultural back with Nick Pope Mick do you think at all but the alien presidents appears to have any kind of threat to us as a human species\nWell this is a problem we grappled with a lot at the ministry of defense and and they fight the I'm lost two miles\nIn in the what's now when the ten year program to the last find release them go heavily into the question of whether there is or isn't a threat and how could you tell and who should make that assessment and in fact um it it gets quite\nFractious um between different divisions in the ministry of defense and and some of the the\nThat does make quite amusing reading as as the intelligence people are telling some of the other people you know who do you think you are to suddenly put yourself into the role of of of an intelligence\nAnalyst and and you know ... that's not your job and um what what the intelligence people\nConcluded they they made a a kind of analogy and they said I'm a ... if you don't mind are actually going to document in front of\nMe home please give us some quotes from yeah\nThis is a this actually haven't officially been released yet\nI'm there will be tonight at night I'm\nThe same can them critical question is do you a piece represent a possible threat to the defense of the realm we could argue that assuming for the sake of the argument that something exist\nThey have never shown any hostile attend\nIntent and therefore kennel represent a threat however\nRussian aircraft attempting to penetrate the u._k. I defense reaching in the Cold War never showed hostile intent but they certainly represented a threat is the only logical conclusion that we can come to is that we do not know if you ate pays represent a threat to the defense of the rail\nAnd so this gets quite interesting because a part of the the ministry of defense was saying\nTo parliament the media and the public no there's no evidence of any threat here we we look at these things to see if that is a very different interests but no no no threat and yet in ... and ... there were classified documents saying well look we just don't know we have not yet made a proper assessment and\nSo we we can't tell\nWe simply can't sell well what about the alien abduction phenomenon I mean wouldn't that be proof for some kind of threat\nWell it it it would be if we could absolutely say that it's it's physically rail and not not some sort of combination of hoaxes and psychological delusions and\nAnd an other misunderstood phenomena the the other thing is of course we don't really know what's going on some of the people who claimed to have had these abduction experiences say that it's really really traumatic and and suddenly researchers like Hopkins and Dave Jacobs\nWhere we're always saying\nYou know the whole style and it's it's a threat on the other hand people like John Mack\nAnd and some of the other people who take him on new agents spiritual view of this talk about healing and things like that and he goes back to the idea of who who can really say I mean it sounds bizarre but in millet treat 'em there is actually in a way\nFor working out whether this is a threat to our knowledge or rather this this is a kind of them\nWe don't know the values but intelligence some military sickles we say that threat is defined as being a a construct of capability plus intend\nSo so you look at the capability you look at the intent and then you would count as a threat and if there is what ... what kind of a threat\nIt is well we have some idea about the capability of pay and and again the the file the ministry defense files they quite clearly you know speeds and maneuvers way in excess of anything that we've gone so the Cape\nAll the ministry of defense file state quite clearly you know speeds and maneuvers way in excess of anything that we've gone so the capability we we know has a higher value what we don't have any idea about\nIs intent if the if there is an intelligence behind this phenomenon frankly we don't know what it is we don't know what it once we it may be unknowable in the u._k. the astronomer royal to march in race\nSpeculating about extraterrestrial intelligence and and uh gender and motivation said it may be trained prior to try and figure this out he said it might be the analogy would be trying to explain quantum mechanics\nAnd you can find the well we don't know what it is we don't know what they want but can you categorically scenic that it's happening\nI Can't say that abduction is happening no I I don't know that but I mean visitations visitation well\nWhat I can say is that there seems to be strong and credible evidence that you a pay our rail that paid do routinely penetrate tall already defense\nRegion I'm In the u._k. the U. S. and presumably elsewhere and they all seen by pilots they are trying to on radar they performed speech and maneuvers that we can't match so in that sense yes this is a real phenomenon and of course we've now seen which brings us back to the tip\nStory we've now seen those declassified videos of of navy F. Eighteen super on its chasing some of these things\nNo as a matter of fact let's talk about the navy jets what's your take on\nWell so far we've got three three videos I'm pretty amazing do yeah I absolutely\nI if I sat down and watch these things with um pilots\nWith I I've actually being in a situation where I've\nI've I've watched these things and been sitting around a table with with a commercial\nAirline pilot and I'm retired military pilots and we've we've ... this around and and nobody's saying that this is is fake or anything and of course of course it's it's not um [noise]\nWe don't know again and I I'm not one of these people you know sometimes I listen to two people being interviewed makeup nonstop for everything [laughter] I'm sure you've probably interviewed a few of them they don't want to name any names I Hope he will will respect the fight but\nI'm not afraid to say I don't know\nWell I Do I mean because you're not a skeptic by any means but if you're a researcher a darn good one in saying that you don't know who is that's fine with me\nThank you I mean I don't know I think time I'm\nA skeptic no either I'm only a a ... I'll I'll believe everything kind of person and again let's be honest there are there are quite a few in\nThis field I mean the real real life in my experience of looking at this government the real real situation is is far more complex than than real or not real and skeptics vicious believers and the idea that there's ever going to be one solution to the U.S mystery is is I think\nYou know crazy I I just don't think it's going to pan out\nBut to go back to your question yeah we've seen those three videos um we know that there are\nA more videos sometimes I think will be something that will come over the next few weeks and months there is always the pressure\nGoing on behind the scenes to say well come on this doesn't happen in a vacuum these sorts of incidents have been going on for years um we have a number of pilots from ... talking about this there must be many many more videos Lou Elizondo has said that there are other people involved\nIn in old less have said that there are part of course none of these people\nWant to preempt ... the cod or the CIA and and any other agencies involved might decide on this I mean I think if if people start talking about stuff that's genuinely still classified and the government hasn't released those people will end up getting a knock on the door\nWell we've heard that happened before haven't we [laughter] yeah\nDoes it stop ...

them of means no one was afraid of the things they took for granted it was just part of their lives so unless you're taught to be afraid of these things you're not really a phase of them\nDid they

everybody would say oh you have to see the ... you know you'll love\nIt [laughter] what do you think it's not a big deal you know\nWell it's it's a great point which is of course it goes back to this this thing that I think a lot of people in this field do no I'm the idea that this phenomenon suddenly started in Nineteen forty seven is of course crazy I mean people have seen strange things in the sky since the dawn of time\nThis phenomenon suddenly started in Nineteen forty seven is of course crazy I mean people have seen strange things in the sky since the dawn of time but I think the other interesting thing about this this cold and these these familial\nRecollections ... is the fact that you know these these phenomena are always interpreted through the lens of of personal belief system and culture\nAnd and it is interesting when you come up against couches where where this this thing is is almost commonplace that it's it's like oh yeah you know that that's the thing we don't necessarily know what it is but yeah it's it's real\n... real let's go to Andy in Norwalk, California now why indeed go ahead\nHi George you're great patriotic and Mr call it's a real honor I listened to many times and you're very um [noise] informed and entertaining to listen to a two part question if I make a first of all a based upon all of your knowledge of um [noise]\nThe western powers all of the NATO countries and for that matter let's say the eastern bloc countries ... approximately how many ... as long as you've been following this how many uh aircraft and uh pilots have disappeared and this guy while pursuing\nSo called UFOs and are based upon your response I I have a second part a final question if I may okay\nNicky with us yeah sorry I thought you were going to hit me with pot too straight away\nWell we'll wait for that will ... will lose out on the one\nI'm now I'm going to sound a little bit skeptical on on this I Would say the answer is less than\nThan a lot of things that I've I've read in in the UFO and alternative belief communities I mean I've I've seen some people talk about pilots going missing and and your fires and I think\nYou know unfortunately flying is an inherently dangerous\nUm occupational certainly laws in in the early days in a lot of lot of a cough just\nBecause they crashed now now of course then you have\nYou have some classic cases like a ... the mentality case he didn't disappear of course but he crashed\nChasing a UFO which skeptics say with the planet Venus we coming off of cost the fortieth anniversary of arguably the most famous disappearance of all time involving a UFO Frederick ...\nOh yes and that was strange I think we're literally don't use the way in Australia right\nYes I absolutely over the or is it the ... straight I think the task ... straight maybe the bass straight is part of the task ... say excuse me I'm geographically challenged in that particular part of the world but\nUm but I I don't buy into the room as that that I've heard the pilots were ...\n... and disappearing or all the time as a result of of that we had a case in the u._k. tragic case involving a pilot who who just flew his cross into the city\nIn in I think Nineteen Seventy it was during a night exercise and some people years later I tried to a tribute to us for a story on to that but I pulled out the board of inquiry\nFile which was about two inches thick I went through every single pipe in not filed and I couldn't couldn't actually substantiate any of these UFO rumors so I think\nI think the answer the question is is very few\n... do you okay go ahead and say oh okay so the second part question based upon your your response to this is you\nProbably know during the Eisenhower administration there were so many aircraft\nThat we're a suddenly a malfunctioning falling out of the skies\nAnd uh yes in some cases just suddenly disappeared that the Eisenhower administration gave the order\nTo a stop to pursue the aggressive pursuit by American aircraft obese UFOs or and secondly I spoke to Dr Heinrich or before he passed away a Chicago radio station for about a five to seven minutes\nAnd I asked them what are the chances of\nA life or not existing on other planets and knocked coming and visiting us um and he said impossible that that was his response impossible so I I appreciate your perspective and I do personally believe\nThat they dominate the skies any time\nAnd every time that they come a within our airspace there's so many thousands tens of thousands and God only knows maybe millions of years ahead of us\nThey could be entered dimensional they could be physical or both but I don't think we're much of a match and they do have air superiority and [noise]\nI Do appreciate the honor and pleasure talking to both of you\nIn the Persian and well said by the way and and\nAnd he made a really interesting point which goes back to something in the British Intelligence is Aspen project ... and that was a I I don't like to call it amusing but ah I it was kind of\nPoignantly amusing maybe that there was a line about the flight safety and safety implications off you ate pea soup which goes directly of of course to the point\nJust made and there was a recommendation in ... combines final report and it said I don't have it in front of me but but effectively a pilot's encountering you ate pay\nShould take no action apart from trying to place the object is done in other words you know whatever we dealing with here don't mess with it\nNo mess with it or we're going to take a break pretty

opinion uh assuming we're being visited do you think most of them look like these so called de Leon graze the people described or do they look like us what do you think\nWell it's tricky question because I think the media kind of ... might have this this kind of\nTrump or me or whatever you call it of of the alien gray and then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because I think you know when people say oh I've seen one of these aliens gray lodge head\n... shaped oil it gets reported but when when somebody says they see something that doesn't quite fit the mold maybe it doesn't quite make the caught or get the coverage but in my experience when people report and it just as when they report UFOs they come in all shapes and sizes\nAll they sure do what you but you saw almost saying then that people basically they\nHear this they hear this and then they think they see it\nYes I think the section plays a big part in this but here again who who can say what um what technology if we are being visited by a civilization in let's face it the universe is\nNearly fourteen billion years old\nImagine what a civilization which you say a million years headstart enough money to be able to do in terms of you know hiding themselves marking that true appearance deception uh it's it's unimaginable so so again I think we're in this territory where\nWhat we watch what we think we see in perceive may be very different from the reality of what's going on and they may ultimately be\nUnknowable to us through a species of our town level of development what's your thought of the propulsion system that\nWell it's it's clearly are going to be some something exotic I guess we're in in sort of\nStar Trek ... tree and in one sense of some sort of foster among the light\nTravel again there are some theoretical physicists working on this sort of thing trying to figure out whether it would be paying\nSpace time whether it would be using wormholes I suspect gravity is going to be the key to this um gravity I guess of all the fundamental ... is the one that we\nKnow at least to bow often and therefore it the one where we're perhaps more likely to make quantum leap breakthroughs in terms of of science and technology\nThat's going to the phones again let's go to Alex in Rochester New Hampshire to get things started Hi Alex welcome to the show\nI think you have a question of her new hope um I Hope to practice it with a little bit of a critical experience um I saw a where I Would call a UFO I'm On there for two thousand and Thirteen and print town in New Hampshire but what do you want twenty miles west of a Manchester\nI'm On there for two dollars and Thirteen and Francis town in New Hampshire but how do you want twenty miles west of a Manchester\nAnd I consider myself a politically and religiously liberal conservative at all and I'm clear sober but ... had a definite um [noise] really evil vibe who are real I don't I Can't say for certain it was demonic but it really had a very negative right who had the whole experience\nVery scary very creepy had a very predatory feel that you believe that it's possible that some of the in pelican extraterrestrial visitors 'em might possibly be eager evil or negative possibly demonic not all of them to maybe from\nWell I again I think it takes us into this territory of won't all week dealing with even if we didn't leave some something real do we really know what it is could can we really\nAre a scribe human emotions to at the problem with all of this if we can only come at this from\nAn answer ... point of view\nAnd we tend to to be kind of you know very black and white I think you know our thinking\nSometimes we see it in politics we see it in religion you know it's glass half empty glass half full good aliens by aliens and and you know one has to wonder does this actually come from whatever it is that your interacting with well does it come from you or I mean\nA cultural background belief system\nSection may be influenced by by\nOr science fiction or whatever it it might be I I don't I don't like to take anything off the table I mean I I I tried to be open minded with all of this and\nI think earlier in the show I said that there is unlikely to be one single neat solution to the usa mystery so I think you know when you ask me what might be out there I don't think if there are other civilizations and the costs ... which I firmly believe there are\nI don't think it's going to be a question you know there's just one other civilization um therefore you know are they good are they that I suspect\nIf we share this cause most\nWe share it with with a whole bunch of different civilizations which which may have absolutely different points on the mall spectrum if I can call it that um I guess the person's way of saying that would be you know there's probably\nGood aliens outlet but knowing I'm actually steak\nExtraterrestrials and and evil restless yeah with with the various intentions\nWas no question about it in you know I'm so convinced that in this vast universal bars and maybe even the multi hers that the prime more more ... is the same\nWherever you go you're going to have the same elements the same complexity you may have water you may not generally you probably will if\nYou're close enough to you store your son you're going to have things heat up a little bit I think there are millions civilizations throughout the universe the big question is how did it start and you know let's take religion out of it you have to do that for for just a moment\nWhat what do you think was the cause the jumpstart for life\nI have no idea I I mean I think it's if if you throw nobody knows you\nKnow if if you throw the dice trillions and trillions of times they eventually maybe it'll it'll come up right but but much smarter people than me\nWith relevant experience in biochemistry and and all related field have have no idea frankly they ... they have some hypotheses but we haven't yet manage to\nTo create biological life I think I'll be controversial I think we'll create machine intelligence before we actually managed to create our selves\nCher biological life in a

capacity to influence out\nWe don't have this and that Dan Yan ... well if that's the case\nI I Know a lot of member we at the beginning of the school year we started talking about all the teachers who are buying things on their own\nNow there were ... actions that happen right so we're going where's the money going ... that we have we're putting aside or what is it a hundred and eighty billion dollars that comes from the feds every year\nAnd who knows what untold billions you spent by the states and then property taxes and ... in Massachusetts were building for example the new school in our community school costs Ninety six or Ninety four million or something ridiculous like that\nAnd the state pays for forty million of it state pays the state doesn't pay we pay taxes to the state and the Yankees have money to subsidize with the locals are going to have to pay\nAnd attacks override because we don't have the facilities within our budget to pay for the new school\nSo ... what's going on with all this money to build a nice school got the money to do that we don't have enough money to buy paper books pencils though they don't use books anymore they all have tablets assigned to them so that's another\n... eleven remember town meeting couple of years ago we approve eleven hundred dollars a piece for tablets for pretty much everybody in school\nIt's so what ... who's using all these tools that are there why do we have such poor results\nIs a socioeconomic thing in this circumstance certain it looks like okay so I ask you ladies to give me your a take on this\n... well your question was why or Asian kids doing better than any other ethnicity I think that's a question for Asian kids and Asian parents share your secrets I don't know I have no idea what the answer is I I Do a family structure that stimulate\nIt focus on innovation get out ahead it's a ... yeah yeah ...\nThere's a there's you know there's just a different I think survival is a priority in in some ethnicities it you know especially in urban poor urban areas\nAnd um I don't think the divorce rate to don't think there's a ... at higher rate of single parents in Asian communities so that could be part of it there's a two parent system there at home um I don't know I think that there are probably a lot of factors\nAnd you can't change those factors you know those those are things that you just you can't change but you're right though you have to at least look at the school structure\nAnd the education structure and see obviously there are a lot of holes that need to be plugged up so\nYou know you can't ... if that's if that's if the socioeconomic factor is a huge influence or on who's doing well well we can't really tackled that but you should absolutely get some answers from a superintendent as to why one school that's what a couple of miles away from the other one why\nIs there a lot of different yeah yeah yeah I don't know how big your town is ... it's not a city you can't have a I mean I Know technique is heading out and out but not really say seven I'm I'm In New York are not a city at the town is now it's been and the populist the premium\nHas been pretty stable between sixty seven thousand in Seventy four thousand for letting it I can remember\nOh okay so yeah so that to me especially in a town that small there is no excuse why would there be such a huge difference\nNow so anyway it's interesting to see how these uh it's the it's the sort of same old story\nBut I think that a lot of people are jealous of Asian families because they are pretty focused on getting ahead working hard and that includes or what goes on with students who are in school it's work hard and achieve where we have the opportunity to achieve\nIt seems to be an appreciation for the opportunities that are available here\n[noise] so anyway that's just something to contemplate something to think about also to think about what's going on today national no beard

media mhm what are we supposed to call this guy because I heard Chris shaggy initially yeah I heard that one on CNN they were supposed to CNN and it's been the named first name and news right I mean this is the big yeah it's a big one right mhm then I heard\nTo show the show are no ... ... ... you could show\nThe the one that I think it I thought was like the main\nThat's what I thought I thought that we've been hearing that name since the eighties with add ... to show that he was a big arms dealer yeah and he was in the ... he was mentioned in the Iran Contra yet hearings no this is a name that's been that it was ... yeah that doesn't that's not a determining factor anymore like if you call it Copenhagen for five hundred years it just turned to Copenhagen one [laughter] I just started saying Copenhagen say it's\n... it's guitar it's guitar nope it's cut her\nAnd that was good or for a while to get her for a while yeah uh I don't know I like I don't know how this happens Osama bin Laden and it was Osama bin Laden\nWas al ... al ... al ... was ... Q. U. I. D. A. and Q A ETA\nAll different spellings I don't understand so I heard ... ... cars shockey initially then could show\n... uh and now on the way in today\nI heard in New York Times a person say ...\n... showed G oh you really a show gee\nIt's a whole new one and now we're like a week or to the store and there's already three gentlemen pronunciation this guy's name ... can we settled on

or ... ...\nAnd then whenever the pronunciation is tomorrow but you're right we got to get together on that because that drives me out of my mind it probably is irritating\nYeah it is [laughter] it is I I I never understood that Osama Osama thing how did that happen why why did that happen\nIt's even less explode couple right the here you have a situation where it is the name it's spelled the same but were pronouncing\nIt different at least you can understand that Osama what to do something but they shouldn't get a letter [laughter] they just said no no no no it's it's a you know the guy went from like mid range pick in kick ball so last pick I [laughter]\nLike ... when this happened years ... the guy is dead\nAnd no one ever ... you know no one ever said you know Osama's wrong it's it should be Usama Osama you why no no it just started and if people just started using it\nVery strange\nBut it is very strange uh and like some of it I I guess they understand like for example ah here we say the tiny little country that James Bond goes to the casinos Monaco\nRight mhm in if you're over there they call it\n... ... everyone calls it Morocco now I've never heard that\nI Will say here's another one here we say Martha for the car ... if you listen uh as as as a Canadian sports celebrity I Do quite often to Toronto blue jays games on the radio they the\nMad though it's mad stuff Toronto that's really really I wouldn't get us into that\nI Would say I mean would you be pissed off of ya author yeah they'll call us mad that we're not as though we are I've also noticed the jaguars of being called jak you what do you are on the commercial on the jak you are what it's like they like if you come up with a name on your own\nMaybe you can describe to us what how how it's pronounced\nBut what does the word we already know and they were a hundred years yeah stop it we it's an animal yes and they're not just a car it's an animal to write a buddy ever says jak you are\n[laughter] the Jacksonville Jaguars or no I think that yeah I think that jak you\nAre trying to seem refined\nSo silly so weird I even get yourself so worked\nUp about that I Know what I Hope to have an everyday it every day when she brings breakfast to them they ask her where did\nThis for money [laughter] they just torture her within the rest of her life [laughter] and you can I can understand that you know sometimes I think even\nYou know ... like conservatives get made fun of when they do these types of things are like when you watch uh you know there's a there's one cartoon because we're watching at one point that was and it was just it was just like a nonstop commercial for recycling\nAnd it's like I Know it was a captain planets or whatever do that that is an actual that one is actually a legitimate effort to change kids' minds about environmental is emitted yeah they you know people who created it actually talked about that\nBut I don't know what this one with might have been a pig or something usually pepper pick I like to have to pick a lot a and a pet or it was talking about you know recycling or something I don't know how important it wasn't looking in the recycling whatever like I don't have any\nPassion for cycling I think there's some some ah there's some conflicting evidence as to what good does a there's been several studies that have shown\nNot much not much if any clearly you worked for el ... apparently not know but uh yeah like I don't know do I really need\nA giant a commercial about environmental is on my kids programming and I feel like no no but I mean he also can get a little bit worked up about that stuff ... you know I mean you can get a little a little fired up with trying to find the political messages and these things even if they're there I mean kids\nGrow up into you know adult second thing for themselves\nAnd you know you kinda have to at some point\nI realized that you're not going to be able to control every little bit of that you can just you can do your best and I guess with her values probably the most important thing is to point out I mean she's probably doing you know I'm very worried about uh you know she thinks Brett Kavanaugh's are everywhere and and at any point there can be an assault going on and\nYou know what I mean maybe this is this is consistent with what she wants to pass along to me it's just it's a little ... it is and I remember when people were concerned conservatives were concerned mostly\nUh about some of these Disney movies because of the things that they put in the Disney movies like I'm In the is it the rescuers are the rescuers down under one of those uh there's a scene where the character is going down a street on\nI don't know some type of vehicle and there's a woman\nOr on the ... in one of the buildings they passed that make it\nFor just a ... I remember hearing over that yeah yeah so conservatives ... would talk about that and it would be oh ... ... you can't even see that that's it's subliminal you don't even know it's there and then there was the lion king a scene where a\n... as simple as as a grown lion\nKind of plop down on the side of a cliff and the dust shoots up informs the word sex\nIf you ... [laughter] remember that or this yeah ever that but we were insane for talking about any of that yeah oh\nLeaves that's nonsense but you're supposed to tell your kids are you do you need to ask for that apple is from why why do I need to eat the apple where the ...\nCentury she's saying that rape culture is happening yeah Disney yes\nAnd that's a terrifying message I was ... or send the children [laughter] ... although we've we've had this before I mean the ... the one I always think about Willie walk on the chocolate factory\nWhich is a movie I ... I mean I Love that movie but what happens to the scene where they're just going through the tunnel and in all of a sudden like in really quick like subliminal things you see like a chicken head cut off\n[laughter] why the hell is this is the children's movie it's terrifying that whole scene is terrifying\nI like I don't remember that yeah oh my God like they go through the tunnel and it's like really like psychedelic and weird and like it's that I remember that being yeah why look closely what's going on in there it's not good [laughter] I'm really sorry she gets his head cut off like this like a career out\nOf this is why I'm bringing them making me think I don't know I think as opposed to the scene is supposed to set the like off\nPutting a like if it's supposed to give you an off putting feel like it's supposed to be like things are all everything's twisting around and like it's dimensions are almost changing and like all these strange things are happening you see like\nThe scary or what was the guy's name or with the with the ever left alas he wanted the everlasting job stopper they kept harassing the poor kid for it and then he worked for Willie won't get the ... I don't remember a cat that one of the woodwork but that's about ...\n[laughter] I got a lot of things messed up my mind and may not have happened and then he's going through and it's supposed to even that weird like you're almost dizzy feeling yeah and they flash like a bunch of really fast images and want to like maybe they just\nCutting a chicken head off in the military and it's very strange yeah so we've been tortured with is up for a long time and look how well we turned out the world's fine right everything's going really well I Can't see how there be any downside [laughter] [laughter]\nI I guess you can\nGet to that point where your over your over parenting right oh definitely and that's certainly yeah it'd be the way uh you know that things are going now we we um we recently started a letting our son ... cause I I listen to Lenore Skenazy a lot she's been on the show before she started an organization called let grow\nAnd a free range kids\nAnd basically her mission in life is and you\nMake kids do some things like you don't need to\nAnd a ... a free range kids and basically hurt mission in life is and you make kids do some things like you don't need to helicopter parent over them all the time she's famous for ah she lived in New York so does that leave and she let her nine year old to go on the New York city subway system by himself\nAnd she was called the worst parent in America and your ... honestly my immediate reaction when I read that story initially was she's the worst parent in America right like your ... year old of a subway by themselves like I Can't even imagine the amount of panic I Would have\nBut then you you kinda can I Do it I don't think I could do it either um but you step back and you say well wait a minute like George Washington was like I think he won the revolutionary war to eight years old or something like that and we went through a long period of time where people were\nAre supposed to be as kids are much more self sufficient you know I Know when I was a kid like we would leave the house and we would go play at a friend's houses that all the time to time will be gone the whole day yeah and that whole thing about us coming back\nAnd um you know you come back when it gets dark or when the streetlights come on ... and I like it\n... we use that a lot of times to signify things were safer and better than it wasn't even true I grew up in the nineties this is like in the eighties and nineties more the eighties but ... I was at high risk in America by far\nMore dangerous than now there was a much ... I mean the crime rates were higher ah murders were higher kidnappings were higher everything was worse school shootings were at that rate of four times what they are now when I was in high school and I didn't have a minute of panic over a school shooting in my entire life\nI think we get to that point where we're just we get so freaked out we recently had our you know we have her son like walking walking her dog with a little chore ain't doing it by himself\nOr just up the street a little bit and back and I can tell you just that\nFreaks me out like I can and everything in me not to walk to the end of my driveway and spy on him to make sure he's okay the entire time and I don't know why that is it certainly is it how it was when I was a kid yeah uh and I I I somehow live through it\nI think that the the the instinct there is to just make sure you're mentioning every little thing that you think could go wrong in their life so that if that thing does go wrong you can't blame yourself\nYou know it's like it's almost a selfish instinct where you're just like wow at least I told her I I remember telling my kid five hundred times not to go down a dark alleys and they went to a dark alley and well it's really sad but at least it's not my fault that that that's not really healthy instinct for parents I I Do feel like that is that the basis of it\nOf course you don't want no one was anything bad to happen to their kids\nBut if additional to that like you don't want to be the person who let your kid walk down the street and were something terrible happened everyone's got to look at you and say what the hell are you doing allowing them to walk down that street why were you there yeah um so it's like a double whammy and I think that leads to a lot of that over parenting stuff and ... and I'm sure this\nIs the boat she's in her ... right like she's trying to protect me look you're not going to ... you're not going to say anything to a four year old reading Cinderella that's going to protect them from rape culture that's not going to occur\nYou're never you're never going to be able to solve this problem you believe it's so prevalent ... by a story you tell them after a while I was reading Cinderella or watching\nOr the Little Mermaid um or any of these uh Disney movies because they're already going to be a messed up from\nSimba falling down and blowing the word sex rise of the year from the dust ah that's going to mess them up a lot of teen pregnancies cause a lot of Tripoli Seventy seventies became [noise]\nNinety seven point one to dig dug on air and online at big chunk of radio dot com [noise]\nYou know that feeling when you just know you're experiencing a whole new level of excellence I have felt it a few times\nA first luxury car even my first iPhone you're experiencing a game changer that is exactly the way I felt and you will feel the first time you sit in an ex chair I knew immediately the generic chair they suck and we spend so much time and the stupid chairs get a great chair\nBack on Monday on one big [noise]\nLocal water at the top of the hour on Ninety seven point one the big talker\nRumble Ninety seven point one they talkers studios online at big talker radio dot com and from your smartphone with a big talker out I'll be ...

one showing us our number will Palm Beach Florida Today I Want to go to this issue of this this reporter this guy with the Washington Post today or is not an American citizen\nLived for a long time in Saudi Arabia and it looks like he walked into the Saudi count council a in a counselor in in its time bowl and it looks like he was murdered now Mike Pompeo was asking the president to give the Saudis a couple of days they say they're going to get to the bottom of it\nBut I don't really have any doubt that this guy was murdered and murdered by the Saudis and I doubt it happened without the crown prince and other top people in Saudi Arabia knowing if that's the case\nYou know I Know Democrats want to pressure Donald Trump into doing whatever they want to do and making this the biggest litmus test but let me remind people\nThat Hillary Clinton in the Clinton Foundation took millions from the Saudis she never brought up their horrific treatment of women killing gays and lesbians she never brought up one time the persecution of Christians and Jews in Saudi Arabia\nUm and the same would do for a look at how they treated Benghazi but with that said we already know the double standard exist what are you what do you think that's why I think\nI mean I think first of all that the president is right to be cautious or do you indicate Clinton that we don't necessarily know all the things that are going on in that I I think there will be very foolish\nFor us to a break a relationship with Saudi Arabia which is the key to containing Iran or\nWhat but I think we have to get to the bottom of it let me also point out to folks oh I'm just now working on a novel for next year called collusion and watch the Russians are decide they want to push in the U.S Senate\nOr if I were writing a novel about a Saudi journalist being killed and\nThe circumstances are just strange that that they're going to kill him in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul knowing that the Turkish intelligence services monitor them all the time they're going to do it with a team of Fifteen people um\nIt's almost like if they did do it and I'm not saying they didn't I mean clearly something terrible happened and and clearly\nIn Vegas on their sloppy and stupid and you know a ... it's unbelievable the position they put any of their allies\nAnd you're right we have this on precedent alliance against the Iranian head Gemini with the Saudis Israelis Emirates Jordanians and Egyptians and it you know now that creates massive complications\nWell in but if you look at it you know we've said pretty clearly we're not going to tolerate the Russians poisoning people in Great Britain and to lead to very specific sanctions\nOr I couldn't imagine a circumstance where if we do in fact decide that the evidence is overwhelming under the Saudis have the least promised secretary of state compel that they're going to give him the fool reports now again or they may well be lying but\nYou know in the end oh we discovered that there are key people in Saudi Arabia and all I suspect it will be sanctions but that's different is one thing that sanctions it's another thing you know to go wild and break up the the alliance and the relationship and the Israelis have been very clear\nThat they regard Saudi Arabia as such an important a defense against Iran\nOr do they have urged us to be very careful and this process\nWe've got to go but um that's the speaker uh it does complicate things but people do remember that our arch enemy are aligned with U.S Russia the former Soviet Union to beat Nazi is\nThat's right and I think sometimes you just said\nIt's unbelievable yeah border patrol then you've got the sanctuary city and now we have a sanctuary state of California what does that mean\nThat means people that we know are here illegally that broke the laws to get in here no respect for our sovereignty no respect for American law\nWell now we know those people when they got caught committing

I'm bringing up with the governor I don't think I did with the governor I should've read anyway I keep I keep asking folks as they come through\nI find it it's horribly offensive but let me\nPreface this she's allowed to do that sure sure okay First Amendment rights for it but it's wrong right\nWhere do you agree with that ... yeah I I wouldn't do it and I I understand we're still I think I think there are people okay now who are misguided and their their their their heart is in the right place and I'm not saying that I don't think she's trying to be disrespectful to America or or anything in that regard\nAnd and I the reason I fast cars in ... twenty to and I'm old enough to remember the Tea Party I Know what they were doing in there were if you just look up some of the articles there were people freaking out about these flags being flown upside down and they said well we are in dire distress Obama's our president\nAnd there were there you know and then of course there were veterans and stuff it was very offended who are in the Tea Party so there was a split for both of those\nSo you know I definitely uh\nNot saying that the whole Tea Party believes and find the flag upside down but there was a segment on Israel will hit it they were wrong too and that we're looking at the less Tea Party following the rights the farthest footsteps\nAnd they're doing it I Will just say this about well and it's on her private page\nShe's making a private statement and uh you know she has a right to do it she's doing it the right way\nIf she was doing it from the the diet is like a you know council member as opposed to other with each and every one of her pet causes\nThen I Would really be upset about it because what ... is doing is using her position um and and put out a little mini billboards with her her special agenda which is it has nothing to do with what you know the council's doing usually\nAnd so it it really is it seems to be just an abuse of power to abuse of her position um what ever they do on their private Facebook pages I really don't care I care because I I Want an explanation I just don't know why because she is a publishes the vice mayor of life stuff and you can\nYou are a public figure and I I okay it's a private page now I haven't scoured threats to see if she talks about city council things on there or not but it is\nShe's a public figure she can do I I I Can't stress enough because I've got so many stupid emails on this one\nI'm not saying she can't do it she has a right to do it it's wrong and she it's almost like crying wolf\nAnd ... and that is not and what if the Tea Party did it or if the right to do I would say the same oh yeah yeah you're ... I wouldn't do it and I just I think there's a lot of them is that people who actually genuinely feel\nLike they are in dire distress in the country is in distress on it but we survived eight years of Obama and they'll survive eight years of Trump and I say eight years because it will be ... yeah yeah I mean the way that I mean well hopefully to put up one thousand twenty fourth Warren\nI mean you know you have fun campaign right I mean it's just really a lot but I I didn't I wasn't you know thrill during the Obama presidency a and I had plenty to say to be critical but I never thought it was the end of the world\nI I figured we would get through it although right in my mind a little more broken a\nBone or yeah a lot more broken more national debt and more that it's not that the than slowing down and not the Republicans will go on it yeah we have we have control of every single I'm Sal assigning the budget just put on things saying he wants to see US Cabinet members come up with five percent cuts\nThreatened heavy that it would be nice but I think there is this concern they may lose ... turns and boy are they going to become fiscal conservatism of a sudden once\nIf that happens yeah that's my biggest disappointment these last two years is\nUm they're worse in a in a an event with Congressman Paul go ... on the frontlines well yeah and and\nHe he brought this up uh to me recently maybe it was on the show that if we had control we blew it we could have done so much more I'm paraphrasing here but I mean yeah okay thank you for the tax a tax cut that's great but you know and things are the judges and during the ... Supreme Court and all that but you could have there's so much more\nRight and that's the that's the only but under no illusion alive that\nIf if the power goes back the other way\nIt'll be a lot worse right and a lot scarier and the national debt will go up even highly and yes and I guess just how how fast is it going to accelerate forward\nYeah let me ask you this um before we go to break your eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one um I read this email earlier from Michael who is a forty year resident of Flagstaff\nWhy can't we complete our roads that currently going nowhere and he's talking about proposition for well these these taxes\nOr to build more wrote an infrastructure when we got to come I Can't we complete our roads that currently going nowhere\nWhy can't we have budget proposition to spend money to get traffic onto more a temperature wider roads we currently have Jay W pal he names a bunch of things that are wrong that we've known if Ben round for a long time um I think one of these Michael one of these propositions actually\nTries to address that prop for for Nineteen\nAs he's talking about where you know you're driving down the road and for forty years it narrows down from four lanes to two right right well they're all rich\nWhy can't government just fix that right you know what I'm saying I think for Nineteen is trying to address that but I don't know if it addresses it by then yeah they said the question is where is it really can where's that going to go is it too vague right yeah you guys are very vague so Michael brings up some great points\nUm we have all these problems in a small town in a small city that's no longer a town like Flagstaff you said in Sedona yeah I mean you've heard I I've talked with folks from Sedona and they have this traffic nightmares why can't government fix this stuff and we give them gobs of money\nAnd they want more I can you answer that question I read it or whatever you talked about privatizing the roads are doing something or even have basically libertarianism people are like my road project by roads with the government really doing that Joel wrote everywhere I mean would you be for privatizing the roads just like either you know I mean I always or hundreds of\nThe way they're set up their their set of it'd be really hard to change the entire system but at the bottom line is the government is not doing a very good job of maintaining it I mean\nYou look at all the potholes coming up Seventeen it it's just a nightmare to drive anywhere anymore and they're getting a record amounts of of money at least on the federal side but um my taxes went up my property taxes whenever you've got your barrel they say they can't fix it to the gas tax goes up you know\nYeah Brian and here's what I'll do Brian because I have had on a diet wraps before um I'll bring in da da ... and back on your after you get to the elections I've got kind of a pile of\nYou know these non political nine election things to get through hey Brian I'm Glad you're getting a tax return glad you're businesses is doing good and that you're able to uh take advantage of the things in tax cuts work appreciate you listening\nFor sure you're\nAlright thanks Bryan eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven yeah leave me money in people's pockets right and and get back to a lot more people are going to get a benefit out of that then a bridge and we thought they were yeah oh yeah yeah yeah and I wish they could get a version to make 'em time minute\nRide to work on all of that but a lot depends on a missile election you know what happens with this election is true maintains control over their um do you think that the\nDemocrats are going to get the house no I think the Republicans are going to hold the house the Senate is iffy but I still thinking Republicans have been ... I think Kavanaugh was that moment\nI think it was a ... that really take people off it was a you know the independent ... group of folks looked at it and said what the heck so certainly and and Republicans needed a moment to energize their voters and and that's what it was that's all it took\nOr where do we go here we want to try to get through some of these um how are you voting looks look a little slow skip all over the place you let's start off with like staff 'cause that's where you vote 'em you've got six candidates for council um and you have one of\nCandidate for mayor in one writing now someone called yes said that I spelled the write in candidate for ... wrong again yesterday I don't know if I ... I think I said at very fast [laughter] that's what's hard about this oh yeah and I'm ... do you have to spell it let's assume you have to spell it exactly right but\nHow do you spell it it's George R. I. V. E. L. L. O. R. I. V. E. L. L. O. yeah if I forgot an el\nIs it are they really going to be like that do you work\nThis is my understanding and I I'm not a hundred percent ... yeah try\nThe elections office made you know correct me but I my understanding is is that sometimes they will allow different variations but it's up to the elections office to decide if they want to do that or not and so I guess it will come down to what will the Coconino county elections office do\nOkay well we'll see we'll see I mean writing campaign sees are tough here do it is that even spell it I've smelled the wrong okay were you when you did you write in George\nI did I wrote enjoy hey you know when there's a race with no options at all I'll write in candidate who is\nQualified riding candidate and if there's not a qualified writing Canada right in the ... or ... minutes counted in the generic right infections I leave that right there is a tally of these people were not satisfied with one choice yeah and it's it's it's a shame when anyone runs ... because they think oh I'm doing just great job\nRight now you know I sound all it is is is confirmation and their own mind and you've really every\nDay you see that with all the county races and in Coconino county only Democrats running and and it's like what the what the you know ... that's not a choice you see that with judges a lot and I'm going to get the judges want to hear something but stick finish off flights of city county of six\nCandidates running I've had five of the six on this program ... um there's you choose three out of six I'm definitely not voting for the one who never got back to me yes yeah I mean and then how can you even want to say his name but I actually have any other two are going on the air that I didn't vote for him\nAnd I'm just good for them but and I I haven't even I haven't voted yet I'm of role I go to the poll for me go ahead this was process of elimination I I had to\nFind the least worst found some something I like some of these candidates but I ended up going with didn't live in a Alex Martinez some Regina solace okay I Am still deciding\nAnd I I tell folks you know the whole ...

back on and wine and now that your show I run into people to talk about you all the time you did a great job well hopefully talk about me and a good way they are they are\nHere and I always appreciate all the time you get ... and folks it's not just during election time you know we're having so many candidates come through senator Allen [noise]\nBut um you take the time when you're in office I mean you and I've had many conversations whether I I go down to the capital or your calling in er during session or to fill folks in so I I really appreciate that because\nI have a saying if if you can't if you don't hear from them now\nEr during session or to fill folks and so I I really appreciate that because I have a saying if if you can't if you don't hear from them now you definitely want to hear from them later especially right or go to DC\nWell it's a challenge because we have such a large district but I I Do love being able to inform my constituents about what is happening because so much misinformation is out there so I'd rather be able to explain hey this is what this bill really means or this is what we're doing and so I Try really hard\nTo do that now I have spent so much time talking about\nUm the billionaire out of California is dire who obviously has political ambitions and you know this this isn't about proposition one twenty seven or anything like that this was about a guy\nA building a ground game and he's chosen Arizona's one of his prime targets and prop one twenty seven is the initiative you know I've talked about this before prop Twenty one twenty seven would have Arizona getting\nI'm fifty percent of its energy from renewable resources which basically means solar I just towards ... nuclear power plant Senator Alan and it was absolutely amazing the amount of energy we get out of that and what one twenty seven would do\nUm is it ... it would shut it down eventually your thoughts real quick on one twenty seven then we're going to get into sire\nWell of course and we're always concerned about education dollars and the power very a plant\nIt pays sixty million dollars a year and how would we make that up we would have to go to property tax on commercial as well as private and so we need to be thinking about the long term consequences of such a horrible proposition passing\nSo this guy's dire he he wants to get this one twenty seven thousand Arizona but I I don't know what happened I assume there's probably some kind of this was my guess there's some kind of internal polling numbers saying if not doing well for don't assume that folks do go out and vote no on this thing\nSo he decided let's or that group decided I should say\nThey decided to spend um a bunch of money against candidates it's a pretty short list of politicians and Arizona He's opposing now and they're shifting that money from one twenty seven candidates you are one of them wanted you to do to deserve this this honor it is an honor because\nOver liberal a organization coming against ya\nIt really is and I I think it's because number one I Am the education chair of the Senate and education of such a big issue for them and number two is because I always tell people what I think I stand up by speak out against injustice that I see\nAnd so ah he's you know I'm One of the ones targeted and they think they can flip my seat they might be able to flip the Senate\nWhich should be a terrible disaster for our state the state Senate you're talking to said that it oh yeah how about ... is the state Senate we have now Seventeen Republicans and\nOut of thirty senators it takes sixteen to have a majority and to be able to get anything passed out of the Senate so you can see we have a very close majority in the Senate and so their their goal is to try to flip the state blue and they're targeting the Senate and they're targeting my seat because of\nThat diversity within my a district of and the numbers of Republican independents and Democrats\nHow much money they're spending hundreds of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars and\nUh I've never had TV ads around against me because they're so expensive and you know being in rural Arizona TV's kind of not a good place to put your dollars but they are putting money anti so that that is hundreds of thousands of dollars and I'm ... and I\nAm I concerned of course I Am but I also have a lot of faith in my district and in the base and the people who had known me all these years and uh no my voting record I have been recognized by many conservative organizations all these years uh always high every year\nAnd I'm so I'm consistent and people know that and I think that I Will ... will retain my seat I really do\nOr folks we're talking with US Senator Silvio and she's the chairwoman of the Arizona as the Senate education committee and that's part of the reason why you think you're being targeted ... let's call what is outside money\nUm and what's what is the problem okay you know we talked a lot during last session about all the money that went into education\nThere was a big chunk of money teachers around the states got a pretty significant raise\n... percent raise over three years yeah but then they got like ten percent this year alone I Believe yeah what's what's the issue here are they mad over um the invest in education um initiative that got dumped off the ballot the Supreme Court what what's the problem\nThey're very mad and as you know there's been negative anti science around my district saying that I cut education or they tried to use the tip for particular number for each district where the sinus located saying I\nCut millions of dollars from that school food costs demanding that their customize the net and and that's just it it's just plain downright wrong and I think that people are recognizing the socialist\nCalifornia style task to tactics are not going to play over here in Arizona for instance jak this absolute truth I can show you\nThe the money starting a two thousand and eight which is always the baseline we go back to because that was right before the recession so then we had the recession three billion dollar deficit and of course at that time education K. through twelve is cut three percent everybody else study ten to Fifteen Percent cut\nA it was a terrible time for our state since then we have been re story education dollars and I can show you now today we are one point three billion dollars ahead of where we were in two thousand and eight\nAnd and that is including our teachers race and our economy is growing and thriving and so it's so important that we don't allow these California socialist slight principles to to blanket our state and destroyed the progress we have made\nAnd go back to the people at instead our philosophy my philosophy is listen this is what the people is than\nIs we have to create a budget out of it and we have to be responsible\nAnd we should be grateful that is what gets me upset nobody it's grateful about all these billions of dollars that the taxpayers gives us you'd never get a thank you letter never get a chance\nI haven't had one teacher think the legislature for that race\nAt all because you're not talked about that when it was out and you still haven't gotten to know\nI Am but really I Want him to turn around and think to small business person in their community because that's really where the money comes from is from the citizens but still there's no gratitude and I think that's terrible\nUh we as individual families you and I we have to live on a budget\nWe can't just go out we all we can rack up our credit but then there was a ... you know there was a reckoning day same with the states so they're mad we won't\nPut you know raise taxes and that's where it comes from and it's a different in a philosophy a socialist kind of philosophy versus a free market philosophy and that's the battle that's going on in our state\nIs a socialist kind of thinking that that if we need more money just go get it and the people and um and hey let's go after the rich people I just saw an article where\nAre the majority of taxes are paid by three percent of the people on the rich people are paying the bills\nAnd uh so yeah so it's going to be an issue again and we're going to have of our revenues are doing wonderful we're going to have a surplus this next year and there's going to be a battle where we put it and I know that education will get a lot of those dollars\nWell let's see what happens and yet I I've seen this on local levels to Senator Alan words um they almost look at that money that they don't tax as we're not collecting everything we should you know what I'm saying like it's their money to have where if it's still in my pocket\nIt's my money even if you take it it's still my money that you just suck but sometimes you just like just you could you ask me for pay the taxes of before you go crazy spending it or a folk senator Sylvia ... I guess I I\nGot to ask you about a big issue that ah let me set this up for you because I've been talking with lots of guess about this um and you being the chair a woman of the Senate education committee I I thought this was right up your alley and I've talked about it with Governor do see with other representatives\nAnd it has to do with the growth of universities in general but northern Arizona university NYU um for a long time there's kind of a segment of the population is I case getting a little bit and this was maybe runner's Fifteen thousand students now there's Twenty one twenty two twenty three thousand students\nBut the Arizona border agents and the president of the university they have a target of about thirty three thousand now you know Flagstaff you know these communities this is a smaller city this is Seventy thousand people\nAnd you start thinking about that plus thirty three thousand\nThey're starting to interface on the main drag of the city which is Milton avenue very busy and they're buying up Thirteen million dollars worth of property to to blow the buildings down and build stuff new used to be the universe is kind of back they're hidden away\nNow it's kind of getting creeping up into the core of the time so you got a lot of folks who've lived here for many years generations who are looking at announcing\nHalf the popular are we a city where the university or university where the city anymore does does it get to a point where they tried to grow too much and ... are you hearing concerns yourself and and I guess I'm here to kind of be the condo and say there are concerns\nYeah well thank you for it if I Want to tell you I think any use wonderful university and the and there's more in state tuition students coming to any you than any of our other universities\nUh I mean I I'm a good a big fan of any you but with that being said one problem we have in the city is your land\nBlock just you are surrounded by federal land and you can't grow you can't move out and that's one problem so that that so if the college wants to grow the university wants to grow yeah it has a problem can't move out it's going to have to move in\nAnd uh I think that I can see both sides of that is going to create some problems and um and whether this city can really handle a University of that size it's a really good question that you here locally I've got to determine and um and I think the universities to seriously look at that\nAs the other thing I think a little bit sad about the money to grow that big is I think there's an advantage to coming to a small university yeah I think you get more attention more help\n'em [noise] and I I think that's an advantage to something they could sell you know trying yeah\nIt's I see the billboards and Phoenix that come up to the mountains come to this quaint university but um there's an expression up here that you ... don't Phoenix flag\nAnd I never really bought much into that but I don't I don't need an ASU in my backyard or you have and my back yard um let me let me do back to your son because the governor said kind of the same thing and others have said the same thing it's it's something locally we have to decide\nBut it's I got to be honest with you I have sent many many requests for president read of trying to come on this program\nAnd she hasn't and I'd love her to come out we'd have a great conversation um the board of regents decided to suffer I keep hearing I kind of keep your nose is decision locally but there's not a lot of local talk and input and and uh they're they're not seeking a lot of that out they may have a few public meetings\nBut people are saying and I'm kinda that conduit that saying people are concerned and they they want to talk about these growth targets but then I don't hear from the people that have the power to change it the board of regents the president of the university and so forth\nUm so how do we I I'm putting that out they're worse I I Can't speak for everybody but I can speak to tons of listeners um who are saying we want to talk about this but then we're not hearing back from them so I Want to put that in your ear okay I kind of just so you're aware of it as just as I did with the governor of 'cause it's a huge concern up here\nWell I'm Glad to know about this issue and and for you to bring it to my attention\nEducation's huge or any use a great asset to the community but there are just those concerns that we want to\nA growing community like Flagstaff is I mean frankly I think you you've been you've done well with your economy here\nYou want to address going for\nIn a growing community like Flagstaff is I mean frankly I think you you've been you've done well with your economy here I Wish we could move some of that over ... county we would take it\nI think there's going to have to you're right there's got to be a balance between that growth within the university especially since you are landlocked and you don't have a much land available and so I think those are legitimate concerns\nOr is centered around and you got a few weeks ago\nA couple of weeks ago ... man it's coming up fast let's assume you get back down there um first of all I ask us of a lot of ... something you're really proud of that you've done or in the past and the senator and since you've been done\nWell actually it it kind of goes to education I ran last two years Eighteen bills that were able to I was able to get through and signed by the governor I'd had a meeting with my district superintendents and I took some things that they were wanting changed and I was able to get them changed and and that made me it it\nI see my goal is to do what's best for kids that's number one what is best for kids next\nTo supporting parents and their decisions uh education decisions for their children that choice and third supporting teacher's doing everything I can to support our teachers and so I pass bills to support our teachers\nI ... I created a new a scholarship program for continuing education for teachers at in certain areas we need physics teachers and this would allow them to go back if they were a math teacher and get their a\nContinuing education so they can be a physics teacher I'm very proud of that I I worked with\nA gentleman a mite can he was\nA ... we just had a great that he was a physics teacher and he came and he said here's this problem Senator Alan and we went to work and we fixed it\nAnd a teacher certification reciprocity between other state I could go on and on I Wish I had time to ... Eighteen bill I'm proud\nOf them yeah they did make education better and they they supported all the things I just said children parents and teachers and I had done a I've worked really hard in that area the other one I'm proud of this helping you out of the pie county with their reach out program\nI have a soft spot for the mentally ill citizens in our in our state and we have neglected them as I said as we can't climbed out of this recession there's many things we we have not been able to find and now we need to start looking at other issues besides the education and ...\nWe have a lot of work to do on this date the an emphasis in condom e improves it allows you to do more work and\nAnd I'm excited to get back down there I just talked to share a mash or about\nA this reach out program but she's very proud of and how we can extend it in and help all the different county jails have this program\nAs your measure of ya bye John Ascher yeah he's endorsed you\nYes he has ... has which I'm very proud of that so ah adjust to tell you about some indoor since I've been ... by congressman ... congressman or let's go\nOut and I are many of my fellow senators and and I got supervisors then I've got citizens\nI I'm very very I'm honored and humbled by the support that I have and those who have supported me over these years and Jeff I Want them to know I Am not broken my trust with them and I hope that they will send me back because uh this'll be my last time to go back\nI Want to finish off the things I Want to do for education and um the next step is talking about", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "18"}
