university if you answered yes to any of these questions Arizona State university is the perfect school for you\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great in Virginia and\nOnly twenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop\nI'm generally what I each person is in a check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese Akron as ... and um when that controlled holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in and personal isolation booth and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber\nAnd then I present Emmy sank which is a ... a ... brain synchronization the kinds of technology plus guided meditation\nAnd we do five of these uh day typically and what what the idea here is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state and every person listening in their own isolation chamber through the headphones\nNow they get like a cubicle or a day and decline or how you know it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bit okay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um it's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber\nWhy is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus action like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um\nThe flow chambers exempt in this case you're not floating you're you're in this this\nControlled unit and all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like can be saying\nDo you have headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them and their control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nAnd they don't feel a loner isolated right\nNo that's the idea you are isolated\nAnd they don't feel alone because you have the headphones on you know\nThey they're listening through headphones and exercise minor typically about a Fifteen minutes long each one\n... and and people go on these incredible journey friend who in several times um where where do you think anything is ON Technology is a minority and when you truly hate hate\nThe idea is to get them as deep as possible\nOf course are ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself by nor will be technologies been around for a long time and it helps us go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then\nWhere do you go on Sunni where would you and I knew that pattern that you take people see it it kind of a formula right\nWell there is a yes or the relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis um there's different progression setter used but it's basically a meditative type of program that's guided\nOften guided where you would just go along with the program and um and have your own experience everybody has different experience during even my program\nI'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have passed fly for aggressions mhm they have contact\nWith all kinds of let's just say a non physical being different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up to\nOur inner self people experience different kinds of ah let's just say I opening a mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life or ... or regression type flashes are quite common and there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore your true self\nAnd to open up to that awakened to that multi dimensional self within you\nKnow what to question could you ask yourself and then do you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets the journal or they bring a journal\nAnd you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever ... whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery 'cause information can be\nTransmitted many different ways it's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways\nSo it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information but\nUh people have all kinds of profound experiences and they are waking to their their true self and they're the answers within um\nMhm yeah so the implication that personal growth in the spiritual awakening that are\nHappening in the can really be transformational and I like it because you find your house to them and then in a way you're feeling you William how he died in the direction that\nI Would have my own personal experience now my friend my left me going against on the show before she said that she has in the past encountered souls that need help and I think that's fascinating councils that\nSure um we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just mediate assistance\nOr that's but that will happen in um\nIn all the classes that can happen that comes up in my class as well or where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say to people that and there are people that have died but they are lost or\nFor instance someone that may have died um quickly and they were just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI Know that that type of thing does happen quite a bit and job at at ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses\nOn that type of guidance it's called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in\nThat um [noise] and\nTo let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMhm mhm so to assist him in crossing over or have you ever done this after\nA\nTragic incident and national tragic incident where NASA it's still really don't want\nI have because I I did a I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era and myself and I received a lot of contact\nAh during that period of time\nUm that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way I imagine you're having coffee one morning and your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us even wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're assisting those are people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and its its functions in different names and different cultures\nAnd Institute we we presented in I think I'm more or let's just say I'm very grounded in a scientific waves at least the scientific as we can that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented\nIn a very logical way that's a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really allowed to have their own experience it in on that I went to find out a little bit more on how one of the culture\nI done this and what it's called the content was going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about their culture just exist and and also a little bit more on how you can you do on your own and it was like that but my guess William ...

I'm a belief system that of course is nothing but fear\nFear is a controlling mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population\nOut and it's still used today right actively unfortunately the control um ... you know societies or we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be a feared\nAnd ... that is one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when when you have an out of body experience you realize number one you were a mortal\nAnd it sounds a little grandiose playing\nYou know that you know my God I'm more than my body I Am a mortal I'm I'm not some um week pathetic being that needs to be manipulated or told what to think uh you know I'm I'm\nA powerful non physical spiritual being and that's amazing shift in consciousness for the individual\nI Am more than my body really does help you\nAnd your level of consciousness and forget\nAbout tiny problem in life and you feel are still large because our brain me in that way they truly they are in significant when you come here and he knew\nHow down our universe really in talking about being beyond Bonnie yeah yeah\nAnd what's so important is for us to have her own transformation or experiences I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us\nAnd you look at it like that and you know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance a political drama that day you don't get sucked into that stuff because you realize it's a temporary drama and and you understand there was a bigger game it's foot here\nThe big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer upon of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's and that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of this need to understand that and get out of the rock and we tend to get in with his aunt or uncle news that yeah\nIt's ridiculous you know and you\nRealize it's you know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves the\nGreatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ...\nThat's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of is suddenly awoke one day and knew what we were and where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no war\nI never left none of that would occur ... because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connected but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly I'll be connected to only the ones that would be connected to [laughter]\nWe go beyond the ego\nYeah we we were going to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to take your\nFrom multiple um experiences and reports of people that have a let's just say knowledge of offense\nOr not only in the past but in the future or what we would perceive it's a future you know it's interesting that you bring this up when you leave your body there is no time\nAs we know we look at time is linear but yet those of us who have out of body experience is quickly realize that for instance you can live a life in five minutes it's ... it's there was no time as we perceive it ... in non physical reality\nIt's a whole ... all that that's why it's important to learn about the the dynamics of our true home are true reality which is non physical 'cause everything functions in a little different than it does here [noise]\nUh and that's why it's important to begin to read or least learn about how non physical reality functions\nAnd fascinating can you ask in a long it takes you call it the ... and we can you asked in going into and out of money and maybe your guest any question or\nHow does he get beyond that really going engine you sure more than he giving out your huh\nYou can you can ask anything matter of fact that's one of the things I Try to um teach people is to be open to asking if you have a question asked to get the universe is willing to provide the answers\nYour higher self or your higher mind however you perceive that it wants to assist you if you're open to that assistance\nAnd there is no limit to what can be it let's just say obtained\nUm there's literally no limit\n... but if you have to ask yeah that's great\n[noise] um let's see if she did she are were lined you berry in St Louis Hi Danny how are you\nHi Lisa thanks for taking my call\nI had a question you your guest um years ago while we were to tell them if I ever really close and he passed subtly while we were out of town and um I I wouldn't call back and I just didn't let them my last view of him to be in a casket so I didn't go\nOff and I was upset about that and I had this dream and that was back at least about the time and that was chasing the suspect through a ... a mall very familiar with but what I made the term\nI mean it was my dad he was standing right there and it wasn't fuzzy or not it was my dad ... and I said to him I just said dad and he he held those hand up\nAnd he said you need to settle town it's okay and uh I I Want to talk to him but he was actually phasing out and I was I said to him I said dad don't leave pleased all nice and he was gone and I walked up\nBut after I woke up I I it's stress and everything was all gone in I guess my question is\nWhy this dream on that 'cause I was stressed out about it and it was in my imagination or or does she think that maybe that was my dad actually contacted me from beyond you know life after death around settled me down because it actually works\nYeah I think it was I mean that's reported by my God countless people report that kind of contact and often it's perceived as a dream like experience\nUh the universe is a continuum of consciousness and dreams are part of that continuum\nAnd yes the people especially in within thirty days of an individual passing the the the chance of contact is incredibly high ... and often will perceive it and a dream like environment because we're more open\nWhen our ego mind is when we fall asleep or Hugo mind set aside and we can begin to experience is but yeah I think that was a valid\nAbsolutely valid a contact Mm uh I Know I've had that with my mother on many occasions and almost everybody I Know it's had some form of contact\nAnd that kind of regard with a loved one\nIt sounds very healing yeah\nSaid well it is very healing I I think that's a wonderful experience\nAnd I think your intention was right to be a father in ... you remember him\nRather than any ... and I think really wonderful intention and he basically did this technique without intentionally and thank you for sharing that um [noise] let's give it to me

old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom at the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nOh [laughter] I thought it was just so precious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary\nFriend when I was a child too and I didn't think much about it we'll see started telling him what to do like oh in the beginning it was really sweet like oh sue made me eat those cookies that you told me not to eat and I'd\nBe like that Phillies sue [laughter]\nYou know innocent but then uh I I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about it and my first book haunted managing springs I changed the name\nOf the people and how old is your nephew epigenetics at this time next and\nOne night in the middle of the night he came into our bedroom crying and he was covered\nIn scratch marks and he was bleeding\nOkay he was bleeding and it looked like he had been bitten all over his body and I pulled off his shirt and he was bruised and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what is happening to you and he had his in his hand\nAnd I ran down to his room and he had to cut the ear off of our cat and he said that still made him do it oh dear you said stew\nI'm Sorry he kept calling it stew this go stew it wasn't sue I'm Sorry it was too well it was after about two or three months my nephew had his speech and pet him and and really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners name\nThe one that died\nNow the one that did not like me anymore right for and before oh it was awful he said to me stupid doesn't once you any here anymore [laughter]\n[laughter] and then how would you do did you\nOh my gosh I was so frightened you just to me even to recall it and like I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell that story um it it was\nThe ... we had to I we had no choice right you had no choice oh where did you do that\nOh we had no choice and then if it's if it's to make matters even worse is like I told you I was having these um haunted wine and cheese parties\nAnd like I said in the beginning I just thought it was fun it was like oh that silly stew he stole something again you know and I might find\nOh my eyeglasses in the freezer or or they might be missing completely for a week and then I might find them outside in the driveway it was just kind of ... in the beginning and and and fairly innocent\nBut what I really think happened was not only did we have the ghost of the former owner there but Tom because see remember it was hunted before we bought it supposedly\nSeveral owners or several people wins or men you know I'm just going to say\nThat what we ended up finding out was that it was it puts on a portal [noise] it is it's it's really strongly haunted still\nAnd you are still living there no milk no after\nFive years we did get out we got out and the day that we left the day that we decided we had to leave every single doorbell and the house was going off with was a four story home and we had doorbell is on every level\nWe took the doorbell about the batteries out of the doorbell on the first level and then the second level and off we took those batteries out the third level went off it it felt like they\nWere driving us crazy like driving you out would happen celebrating what came of that place what would happen to him\nWell actually after we sold it then the Maddox family bought it and this was in two thousand five and they just sold it about two years ago but wildly owned it in two thousand fourteen [noise]\nOn a ledge was voted number six on the nation's top ten most haunted places just behind the Lizzie Borden house\nBy USA Today and the Huffington Post\nWho would buy something like that\nAh it actually you know what about talk about true beauty what happened with this house is that it was actually bought by someone who turned it into a Buddhist\nA Buddhist retreat and it's wonderful because last I heard is that they cleared all the spirits away and that the house is happy again so I Am really\nWould take a lot of work but\nThey have done so much work man with ... experts and they uh they changed the gardening they change the direction of certain you know that really works it apparently\nIt worked because it's it's it's free\n[laughter] fascinating about\nA hundred years yeah it was tremendously haunted and then later after you know let me being a historian and everything I Want to know why the house was so haunted [noise] and I won't get into\nNow did find out that\nThey were the reason they're always at any time something tragic or horrible happens it leaves a psychic in in print or Bruins if you will that can be felt by some people and I'm One of those people unfortunately\nWell at least you know that about yourself some people may feel it and not know how to interpret those feelings or interpret things that are happening in their lives and\nThis is so interesting that you should bring this up because I'm actually my children stepmother\nUm their mother died of cancer when they were one in three years old\nAnd so um they're both very smart people on both of them there have there a doctorate degree my son interesting enough um is a doctor at Stanford right now and he was the only one in our family who never saw a ghost when we were living it on a ledge or experience something paranormal\nAnd I really believe it was because he just didn't want to [laughter]\nNo he had an analytical mind and want to become a doctor censored like he\nTotally turned it out so all these years I think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy until\nI knew I wanted to know what he tells his friend do ya my step mom's to go turn [laughter] and ah\nIt it's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally [laughter] oh it has to be validated you oh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling so now you still live in ... springs right tell us a little of the history of that area\nWell this I Believe this is one this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone\nI'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right\nYeah oh well this was his home base he is to hang out here all the time\nBecause we have a lot of lightning here you know where we live in the Rockies ... and I'm so he actually built a lab on the top of pikes peak he he was fascinated with manages springs especially because we have some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the\nPerimeter demanded his springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we have and my how this will shake my hand and never find true north I kid you not the\nThe end of the American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in the second place in the trees actually grow kind of sideways and it's just curious so that the hair on my back on my arms and my neck will go up and um you can feel it um and the other thing that's serious about it is that\nBecause these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the clubhouse hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just\nGoing over managing springs like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense of ability to find their way true north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain and\nIt they he was saying he was the lady that maybe because of the magnetic anomalies at the Brits were hunting confused because they were actually\nBehaving in a very strange manner by like\nDiving into buildings and and like kind of how the pilots [laughter] interesting\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you what we were just talking about men are few springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there wherever else in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just call to you\nI'm I think another reason why I'm that\nPeople were drawn to manage it springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had to pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here that's less their holy sanctuary today would wipe out their war paint and put down their weapons and and there was peace here forever until Victorian came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotel and\nWhat have you right over their natural mineral springs that was sacred to them and that the natives actually\nThe town after that and that's why it's so hot that\nMake sense to me [laughter] yeah yeah it does now you live there I Do ... and you like it [laughter]\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here\nI Am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened okay a year ago with September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge now this\nDead body it was awful he's and he lets suicide\nAnd it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started talking to people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a high incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism and I believe it's because the people here have not learned how to um Ross how\nThey they don't know how to channel the energy of managed to that is the legend that that's why there is so there are so many um artist dancers singers musicians that live in this town because they can feel the energy but if you don't properly channel this energy for the powers of good [laughter]\nIf you actually get into a negative mind spot or you don't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't ... it will turn against you it will become a negative force and I know that because it happened to me when I first moved\nHere and I see it happening to other people would I\nWarned them my a godsend moved in with me a year ago and I said I was trying to help them out he was going through a hard time and I have this beautiful addict apartment two bedrooms and a kitchen and the bathroom and I said he could live there for free just needed to get a job he was only here for a week and he you know the the spirit of mandatory Wilber took him and he goes I can\nFeel it I can feel it I've never felt so good in my life [laughter] you know [laughter] I said well you got to be careful well he burned out and about a month and [laughter] and it was really sad\nHow do you suggest people process and energy wherever they live in the haunted house or if it's a a relative how do you channel that energy\nWell I definitely don't want to be around any negative energy anymore like I said I I Try to keep you know a healthy attitude about it if if I can call it bad [laughter]\nBecause you have to think about this why is it goes here why aren't they lingering that can't be good [laughter]\nBecause there is a result business right\nWell yeah but I mean that's that's that's a lot of anger too if you think about it and um\nWhat do you say that you would have to have a lot of anger to these it to be petted here\nUm if you are full of light and full of love and full of Christ consciousness whatever you want to call it I don't think you'd be tethered here after life I think that you would want to move on and toward the light um\nYou know you got a good point there are these beings want to see each other here to hunter disrupt people because they have a grudge\nWell some of them I Believe our conscious and some of them I don't think that they know that they are here still but\nThey're they're all troubled I you know I Love these stories when people go on my bed and breakfast is haunted but only by us friendly spirit I'm like give me a great there are no such thing as a friendly those Casper or otherwise\n[laughter] will because it why would they why would they said that's a good point\nIt's troubling it's troubling and and when you messing around with this okay it it it can it can lead you\nDown a dark road okay I've seen it happened to my friends I mean I don't watch TV and I haven't for Twenty years and it's funny that I'm In this business because now all these goes hunting shows or on TV [noise]\nUm and I guess in the last year or two you hear all these stories about these people that are on these goes hunting shows and they kill each other and that you heard about this stuff I think they get involved into a dark force you know it's nothing to play around with\nOur own goes troubled and our own lives\nThat I Believe so I think that everyone has a different opinion now I Want to tell you something this last book that I just wrote was actually written because of a ghost\nI was called on the telephone to write a story to help this poor person who has been demonized for the last hundred years I helped her crossover by\nWriting this last book\nAnd I have that that is a matter of fact\nIs that been forgotten jails and call runner's\nBoth legends and lore of the Rockies by shit for and it just came out and the very first story is true I Swear to God\nKnows about it [laughter] pardon jealous about it\nOkay about its it actually begins in Nineteen eighty five I was a college student and I decided to go to this little mining town to um interview the owners of this old theater and I'm not going to mention the theater 'cause I Want people to buy my book [laughter]\nAnyway they go to I go to the theater and I have an amazing paranormal experience where I actually saw the former owner of the theater and she was crying and she was upset because her name had been painted\nWell I didn't know what to do when I got back to school I'm not going to write this story they are going to think I'm not ... I did not tell this story to anyone you know I've been single since I was little kids so some times just put it out in my mind and don't tell anyone [noise]\nOkay so now flash forward to two thousand sixteen I have written for books on got goes legends lord of the Rocky Mountains and was quite happy to rest on my literary laurels\nAnd I ... out of the blue got a telephone call from the Colorado alarm company about an intrusion signal\nOn Harrison Avenue and those historians out there might know where that is\nBut only a historian would know where that was\nAnd that being said this was a message left on my home number now I was getting ready to take a walk I heard the phone rang and I was like I'm not going to get it but something told me to get it so five minutes later I went and checked the phone and I'm like oh my gosh this is an intrusion signal at the at the\nThis place you know in the mountains and I'm like what they call me I'm three hours a day\nAnd furthermore I mean only I Would know where this place is 'cause I'm a historian I mean this was really weird not even the same area code or anything so I called the Colorado alarm can be right back and I said why in the devil are you calling me is your check number I don't even have the same area code as as this place\nAnd it was a myth that answered the phone and it was a woman's voice on my answering machine and the man said I don't know what you're talking about lady and I gave him my phone number and he goes we didn't call your house and I said I got it on my answering machine he goes I don't know what you're talking about you're going to have to take this up with a theater\n[laughter] I call the police department and I said you know your alarm going off at the theater and they go yeah get we're on our way [laughter] really\nNext morning I called the mayor of ... this town on what's the name I called the mayor I called the theater\nI Hope everybody I couldn't nobody can give me an answer\nNow did you do have that voice on your side\nLet everybody listen to the first person I called was one of my dear friends dory spent my business partner she is a psychic she's been on good morning America she's pretty well known and they call up and I said what the devil is going on with this and she listens to the tapes you know on my tape recorder on my answering machine I let her listen to it\nAnd she went into a trance and she did a reading and she we found out that I had the same birthday as the former owner of this I'm old theater\nAnd a lot more in common that was just mind blowing and my friend said to me you were destined to write a story about this crying goes because she\nSad that she has been demon all these all these years and no one has hurt her side of the story and she wants you to correct it for her [laughter] you're kidding me and I said you don't know I'm not kidding you so I call I call the I'm\nThe manager of this theater and I told her all of this I go I Know you're going to be ...

question and comment is it's going around this talking point that you know since his cabinet victory that the president is teaching the Republicans how to fight\nI actually think he's teaching the Democrats what it's like to lose and I don't think anybody is picking up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like there used to the Republican just given it\nAnd the question I had\nIt 'cause I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media if instead of a blue wave if there was a wreck I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what would the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival\nUh and safety because I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like our bodies preparing for the Republicans to\nHold the Senate maybe even expanded air hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house\nIn numbers we haven't seen and who knows how like Nineteen Ninety four\nAnd I've been wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ... a media and and and pulling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixty and that got even close to being right Rasmussen was one about away Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump is forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by trust shows them jobs even now after the cabin on hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here on the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back\nThe Republican I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it a\nBuck the Republican governor of California is closer than is running its Gavin Newsom than anybody would ever have believed possible if the Democrats do not retake the house\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy's a reprimand of the first order and\nYou know officer you know our\nGovernment money is separating the two parents that are born items to them\nAnd the cops we bought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch the said well that's it for the show\n\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there are people ought to be more educated more informed smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learn in people with Adam so load block cab idiots\n\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democratic Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nTrump in fact wrote an executive order to end it\nWhich was beaten back on the basis that it was unconstitutional lift the statute in America today says families will be separated\nAnd it's to protect the kids the reason for the reason for the separation is the parents are shoveled off in the holding cells while their cases are educated\nSo I'm watching this stupid show and I see a guy\nWho any under normal season will be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement converted into what\nWays I hero because he is rounding up kids that Trump separating

even matter there's pagan uh ties in a way\nDo Christmas and it comes to Easter the the bunny rabbit the eggs all that stuff comes from pagan roots of the Christmas tree itself I'm is tied to pagan roots but it doesn't matter because that's not what people are celebrating\nAnd so to take a time of celebration who enjoy any more than people are celebrating you know pay guns on Halloween they're just not no kid is looking to get the theological significance\nOf Halloween is thinking I get to dress up which kids love to do and run around\nAnd get candy for folks read\nThat's it you\nKnow the logical you know and and I know that there's a lot of churches and Christian organizations that\nPut on harvest dances or harvest events to try and sidestepped\nThe Halloween situation and holiday but the truth is that the harvest was an incredibly pagan a part of their ritual that's where the uh you know they were\nTied into the earth and to mother earth and its fruits and all of these things and and you just start looking for the devil under every rock and that doesn't help anybody so celebrating birthdays celebrating Christmas Easter the upcoming\nHalloween any of these things are is fine it depends how you celebrate them you celebrate Christmas by you know you know killing a baby animal or probably not putting a smile on God's face\nBut if you enjoy family come together and hear music have food praise God in the process there's nothing wrong with any of these days I think\nI think there's this attitude of\nThis attitude of giving up things that people assume is automatically Christ like that if you give up anything or you sacrifice something that it's Christ like and there are times where your call to give things up there's times where you are called to give up relationships or maybe move\nJobs or whatever it might be but that doesn't mean you need to there was this young lady that I knew many years ago who was very devout and wanted to give her life to God\n\nHer mother passed away and she had things from her mother that meant so much to her\nThat she assumed that they were idols in her life and then she started to dedicate her life to God she started giving up these things I mean more Mentos that were the last vestige and connection she had with a person or life or mother\nAnd she threw them in a dumpster show God how much she loved God and years later she was so resentful towards God\nThat she fell away\nNow you may say well then those things were idols no but it's not that it's not the point\n\nThe point is that they're that God is not asking you to do some grand gesture every moment about is asking you to live a life\nThat glorifies God\nAnd these big acts the book burning and getting rid of records and all these you know it's not about any of that\n\nIt's about trying to connect with people be kind to them now is that going to get to heaven no you have to have a relationship with God but these things on this world on this planet are important and that is to connect with one another to love and to be kind to one another\nAnd and not look for ... religiosity at every turn there are times for that there are times for reflection there are times for the prayer obviously\nAnd to sit and ponder the things of God whether it be through meditation godly biblical meditation or to connect with God in those waves all wonderful\nHowever\nThese big grand gestures or people in the Philippines during Easter or kneeling themselves to crosses\nDoes nothing for God\nAnd his will and his movement and his cause\nSo giving up\nSomething that someone enjoys like a birthday and to be celebrated celebrating life and enjoying one another and all these things\nThat it it means nothing to God there is no oh my goodness well look what they're giving up it means nothing it is it's an outward it's something to just stir up other people and say look have different I Am if you want to show people have different you R B kind\nConnect with people put them first be selfless\nBut there's nothing wrong with celebration and if you want to make it about your your mother on your birthday that's fine too there's nothing

and let me share some words with you that will be enlightening encouraging and quite possibly even challenging to your life\nWe begin a series on what does it mean to live a life of faith\nTo try to fix some of the mystery away to try to take some of the the um the the wonder about it and what does this really mean because I don't believe most Christians understand so this is what I'm trying to do is to help you and I to understand what does it really mean to live a life of face\nTo face this kind of one of those those different kind of words in and of itself\nWhat does faith really mean well we got into this last week and I want to jump correctly into this morning faith the Bible teaches very simply is an action word is a verb but\nIt is something that describes something we do it is not just something we say is not something that we just give 'em a that we are seed to or we agree with\nIt is something that we actually do face is an action word it means doing something it literally\nMeans taking God at his word and trusting God said what he meant and meant what he said and then he will follow through as we by faith belief\nBut the question is why it's so hard to believe the Bible and what ... said and yet in today's society is so easy to believe man and one man said\nWe we we look at the Bible than we think somehow that maybe the Bible is just made up of all kinds of let me say this white holy ghost filler words\nWords are just kind of connected together to give a nice story did have a nice uh uh believable transition from place to place are thought to thought well that is not the Bible but it's not the Bible that it's not what the Bible teaches\nLet me read to you James chapter two verse Seventeen twenty faced by itself if\nIt is not accompanied my action is dead it goes on to say someone will say you have faith and I have ... well show me your faith without your means and I will show you my faith by what I Do you believe that there is one God good\nEven the demons believe and they shut her and then the scripture concludes here inverse twenty you foolish man can't you see the face with our works is useless\nWe talked about and belief and we talked about what does it mean to believe well once again belief\nIs an action word face is an action word trust is an action word and they all three come from the same Greek word\nIn the Bible faith trust belief if you say you have faith in something that millions you trust him something if you say you trust in something that means you believe something really have face belief or trust means to take action the Bible\nTells us in John chapter three for gun so love of the world that he gave his only be gotten son who's so ever believe in him that were believed means to cling to acknowledge\nAnd to trust in the one that gone ahead and give he said if you trust me I Will\nBut this this atheist organization hired a a judge and and for a few excuse me\nIn Florida to uh go to court to try to sue for the fact that Christians and Jews all have holidays\nOne of the Florida the atheist became incense over the preparation of of Easter and Passover holiday and he decided to contact his lawyer about the discrimination\nThat was inflicted against atheists a nationwide by the constant celebrations afforded to Christians and Jews and and all of their holidays while atheist\nActually he believes had no holiday to celebrate\nWith the case was brought before the judge and after\nListening to the passionate presentation by the lawyer the judge bang down his gamble and declared case dismissed\nWell the whole courtroom was was shocked and they were in dismay and all of a sudden the lawyer immediately stood up and they can inject into the ruling and said your honor how can you possibly dismissed this case\nHave Christmas they have Easter they have many other holidays Jews Passover and young too poor and Hanukah and many many other holidays yet and my client and all of the atheist in America they have no holiday\nWas it a judge kind of adjusted his robe and he leaned forward in his chair and simply said well I'll believe obviously search your client is too confused we even know about\nMuch less celebrate his own atheist holiday\nWith a lawyer very pompous Lee said Iran or we are unaware of any such holiday for atheist just to win might that holiday be your honor\nOr the judge once again adjusted and the robot and said well it comes every year on exactly the same date April first and since you're counter sets April first as April Fool's day I Would lie for you to consider this evidence jury fact\nSong chapter fourteen verse won states the fool has said is hard there is no God that's so sir in my opinion\nIf your client says there is no God then my scripture he is a fool\nAnd April first April Fool's day is his the holiday\nAnd he slammed his doubled is gaveled down again and said now have a good day and get out of my courtroom [laughter] [laughter]\nIt was if you happen to me listen to my voice and you believe there is no God uh you're probably not too happy with what I have just read it but the truth is how do you look at the world\nAnd not believe there is a God how do you look at the world and not have faced the Bible teaches us even create a patient itself shouts that there is a God how can you look\nAt all the things in this magnificent a world that we live in and say there is not a God\nHow how do you look at all the animal life all of the trees all the plants all of the beauty and the granddaughter of this magnificent place we call the the earth that we live and said that it just happened it just ... but it just came up\nI Am I I I Am mesmerized many times that some of the things

different species and the different animals and creatures that live in\nThis world in my backyard at various times we will see herds of elk and hers and here are just just from looking in our back yard and [noise] and we'll have hundreds of geese and and we'll have all of this beauty\nAnd for me to sit back and the thing that that somehow just a mall or just kind of ... out of the ocean\nWhich showed kind of an ignorance on my part to not accept and to acknowledge that there's a whole lot more going on in this world than things just showing up the fool has said in his heart there is no\nGod but let me step back into understanding faith and living a life of faith is seen when do you believe in God is\nIs there that you have to accept what his word has said and not in doubt in John trapper fourteen verse won it says do not let your heart's beat troubled trusting God\nTrust me also Jesus who is God and the flash\nWho stepped out to be turned to the end of the time for you and Hi to walk on this earth to show us how to live a face still live how to live before God and how to get to know God said post you don't have to be afraid\nI'm not I'm not talking about an unknown God I'm Talking about a very known God\nAnd I am the glass come down to show you what it means to live the life that I have called you to live in James chapter one the Bible says but when a person asked he must leave and not doubt\nWe're talking about living a face filled life ladies\nAnd gentleman remember faces an action word belief is an action word trust is an action word it says in James chapter one six to eight when someone asks you must leave and not in doubt because the one who doubts\nIs like the wave of the seat tossed to and fro and and and blown and tossed by the wind\nIt goes on to say that that man on the one who doubts should not face that he will receive anything from the lord\nFor his doubles minded unstable and everything he does see this is a picture of someone who chooses not to live a life of faith they become double mind and\nThey have their their foot in the world and they have their foot and God they don't know where to stand they don't know where to put their trust but once again ladies and gentleman we see by this passage\nThat faith is an action or belief is a national were trust\nIs an action where it means I have to do something if I say I believe I have to do something if you're listening to the sound of my voice today and you say you believe in Jesus Christ\nBut you do not live for him that you just said okay he was a great teacher or he walked the earth or or whatever the case but yeah you do not dedicate your life to him there for a living for him well then you have to ask yourself am I really a Christian because the word and Christian means\nChrist like so we see by James chapter one that living a life of faith means I have to live\nI really believe what God's word has to say there are so many that are ... that are in ... they just simply because they'll accept things of the world but they will not accept the things that got\nSome people would sit back and say well past or how do I ... the world and not God well my response was very simple by the words you speak I've heard so\nSay that God has put the sickness on me to teach me a lesson folks ... where do you find that in the Bible where does this say that God put sickness on you once again in the book and James Bible says God doesn't attempt to any men with evil\nThat's for God's word said God is not going to do something contrary\nI've actually heard other Christians and sadly I've heard it even taught\nBy different pastures that that you lost your loved one that could open your eyes or that you you've got cancer because God is trying to humble you or that this other thing that I can fill in a host of different blanks or folks that is contrary to God's word\nGod does not say one thing and do another\nJames chapter one verse Thirteen I just talk to you about that says when men is tempted no one should say that God is tempting made or wouldn't man is is going through a trial or or a testing or some kind of situation that God is tempting may look what it says here and James chapter one verse searching\nFor God cannot be tempted by evil and nor does ... attempt to anyone with evil\n... does not tempt his children with the you know with evil or sickness or paying\nThe Bible says that he took the weight of the world upon himself why would he expects you and I did carry what he long ago\nBuried at a place called calvary than belief is contrary to God's word God came this seeking to save them that were lost he came to seek to say not to condemn and\nDestroy Jesus said I did not coming into the world to condemn the world but that the world through me might be saying you know or the temptation comes from the trial but\nNo one in our system of government of a free government should ever run on a post and when you don't want to tell people that I never had anybody say well I don't agree with you they all agree with me no one should run unopposed\nIf they do that candidate or that incumbent has every right to take that as a ... up from a hundred percent of the population saying you know what I'm doing a good job and in fact I'm going to do more of what I'm doing\nNow that's that's a good point and I think that\nWell I Wonder and I would like to ask the current mayor is that what you're kind of thinking I don't know\nBut yeah why didn't anyone challenge them and there were rumors of people doing it but but they did okay but you're here you're official right again and people may not realize this but if you write in a like if you wrote in me for mayor and please don't yeah it's just not count because I Would not be an official candidate for mayor you actually have\nTo if someone was if they wrote in a ... you know enough right in to beat the uh the candidate on the ballot\nIt wouldn't count that subject like correct about his ... just like just like all the other candidates I had to file papers yes just a lower threshold to I mean a lot of these candidates they did go out there and it's a lot of signatures\nAnd it's hard to get on the ballot and have your name appear on the ballot that is why it's very very tough because of Thirteen hundred plus signatures right um\nSome rumblings that a little bit of discontent out there the fact that I get to be in the election or without having to go through that process here's the issue my name's on on a ballot\nYou you're not on the ... I mean that much harder for ... it has to be incredibly harder because you've got to spell right okay I think the criticism I got 'em or at least the last time I had you on that decreases my bird\nWas we didn't get into issues right and you would you uh just got in the United states you came on I don't even know if you'd officially filed yet it was hey I'm going to do this so we didn't get into she so we need to get into issues because I don't have a ton of time\nUm so the best way and what I've been doing with candidates who come in I'm In most have come through uh the fifth of the six\nCouncil candidates Paul's easy will be on the show or this Thursday and then he pushed it back just a little bit because we have governor juicy coming on as well so busy shoveling proposition for Eighteen I'm going to ask him and continue as candidates this this is the sustainable wages act\nAs you know George the uh wages in Flagstaff have gone up further than in in the rest of the states and you're scheduled to be Fifteen fifty per hour by two thousand twenty two it will be the highest minimum wage in the nation and people are scared people are concerned\nI'm your thoughts on should we slow this down should are you a supporter for eight ... actually a am a supporter for Eighteen\nI'm ... and principally here's why government does nothing well in my opinion a in mandating private industry to raise wages\nOn a schedule entirely defeats the ... the the\nMerit based races where you take out the ability for people to be rewarded for being a better employee than say the next guy it takes\nIn my opinion and George rebel as my my guest running as a write in candidate for mayor for Flagstaff and\nUm I've heard from lots of business owners I've got more folks coming in tomorrow on this issue um about lower let not lower levels employment but less hours mhm I'm we're seeing the stress I but I don't see the stress the economic stress but I don't think we witness\nThe full stress that we may see coming up regarding this wages you can be kind of you to do so well right you see the numbers you see the national numbers President Trump gets little credit for that um and you see the national numbers and that's helping a place like Flagstaff masked some of these bad economic decisions I just think we are headed in a road\nAs a city heaven forbid I don't want to know the recession but we know these are cyclical things or we set ourselves up for some real bad problems down the road here [noise]\nTo me it's it's really simple businesses have to make a certain amount of money not don't misunderstand there's some there's some businesses out there that can afford to pay more than others I Can't afford to pay what say others can um with that said\nIf we continue to cause business to have to pay more\nThey're passing out onto the consumer and they're going to either they're going to charge more or as you say they're going to reduce ... hours or they're going to cut positions\nWould you have supported a counselor an opportunity to change this and get it on the ballot quicker and now we've had another set of increases would you voted to get this on the ballot quicker or to let the people I've a quicker decision and and have it on the ballot say earlier in the year versus the general election\nYeah up probably slow or I ...

that's nine to wait two to six\nTalk and ... today we're going to be talking about the stages of retirements because retirement can last a long time three four decades sometimes\nIs live uh in that amazing because we've had this conversation you know when I first started in this industry twenty seven years ago mhm\nLife expectancy back then was about Seventy three Seventy five you know I'm at today you know people are living well into the nineties gosh yeah and ah you know what I have ... ah we're in the eighties and you know we always sit down and talk and they go well\nWe never thought we were going to live this long but then you know they also feel that we didn't think we were going to feel this young either you know so\nAnd that's kind of a great thing because I guess the sixties is in the forties since the eighties is in the sixties though you know with modern medicine a and\nPeople more aware and more active you know they're living a lot longer right more active so\nThey are more active I think I've told you this before my eighty five year old grandma wears a fit and she still lives at all no way he'll take classes or art classes drives itself around and I think it tells you that so she turned eighty five\nThere was a little old lady who attended her birthday party who was already beyond the age of one hundred to talk about stealing grandma's thunder [laughter]\nThat's right you know oh you eighty five you're just a child\nRight exactly and I said to fix it so great but because of how long people are living and because of how long retirement can last I mean if if you are living into your nineties or age one hundred\n... ... you're not working a part time job more than likely [laughter] at that age you need to be prepared for this financially and\nFor so many people because retirement last so long it unfolds in stages where we have those earlier years where we are more active\nWe have those years toward the middle in the end where we start to slow down a little bit and then the final face of retirement and each one has some different things to prepare for your arm is why do you think it's important to break down retirement into these different stages\nYou know I've always said [noise] you know how to eat an elephant and it's a bite out of time 'cause times people get overwhelmed\nOr when they look at the bigger picture and they go oh my gosh you know I have to plan for all this so you know when I started working with people I actually help them understand that there's actually three big phases and today we're going to focus on one of them\nBut you know there's the accumulation phase is when you're young you're putting money away and you're starting out\nAll the way up to pre retirement you're in what we call the accumulation phase and from there were like pre retirement years you and I sort of think about creating what we call a preservation strategy meaning you don't take as much risk as you were taking when you're younger\n\nYou're listening to the retirement roadmap show fund the retirement you network [noise]\n\nWhy choose more financial to handle your retirement because we provide objective advice and

retirement roadmap shall powered by for a financial grill\nAnd generally jacket and pleased to be here today alongside ... owner and founder of Laura financial group they serve families across northern Arizona you can find them on line at vora financial dot com that's Laura V. isn't Victor Oh our a financial dot com\nAnd damaged important event for you to have realistic expectations for income in retirement\nOh it's paramount because you know with the one of the things we always run into is that you know I was asked people have said you know you're making say I'm just going to use an example so let's say you're making fifty thousand a year and if you're going to retire you incomes going got going to drop down to thirty\nAnd you know what is your life so I looked like I mean do you still need the fifty thousand in a lot of times people say you know what thirty thousand I can I can live with it and you know usually when people say I think I can live with this ah I actually it concerns me and the reason being is\nYou know when I Do my personal finances and I I really think I'm not a spender and then I realize the amount of money that I'm spending on things necessity\nAnd it's a lot higher because we knew eyeballs something versus you really do the math or two different things and so we actually tell people that they should consider doing a test run so if you're planning on retiring\nI Would say and if you said you could live on thirty thousand a year so let's play in that in let's do a six month test run because what that's going to allow you to do is tightened some of the screws on the engine right to make sure that if if there are certain things that we can adjust where you can live on thirty thousand a year that's one thing um\nYou know people have to tap into their retirement account and what is the realistic expectation that you're how much your money should be earning\nA their financial advisors they you know have recommended ... you know estimated that you should be earning seven to nine percent\nI personally think that's a very high number and because what happens is when you are getting to the preservation stage your your have your money is going to work is also going to change because I always tell people that said you know when your retirement and if you're investing like you're twenty eight years old or thirty five years old\nAnd you're taking that kind of risk and most people don't even understand that that that that they're taking that kind of risk\nAll they're looking at is while I'm making all this money but they don't understand when the pendulum swings the other way what kind of you know I've always said you know pendulum swings both raised writes if you just visualize pendulum when it goes up it's pretty because you're making tons of money and you're happy returns are great for you is growing all that\nWhen it goes the other way if it actually turned into a wrecking ball you know gosh yeah you know right into your portfolio our job is to help her clients sidestep that by minimizing in understanding what the risk is and in retirement if you made less money\nBut you get to keep your money that's a good thing you know you know this is not the time to get rich this is the time\nTo protect and preserve and make sure that your\nWithdrawal rate what you're trying to take out of that account is realistic uh also to the growth you were having because you want to make sure that your child in a new growth rate aware if if you're making not enough\nThat and you're taking money out they could start invading your principal and that's what we're trying to avoid\nAnd you know we've always talked to her clients and said listen if you start with a start out with a number and based on your withdraw strategy\nIf you can hold that number steady over your lifetime I think you're in a great place but when you start cutting into it you know that starts depleting fairly quickly and you'll run out of money before you know it\nAnd I talked to a lot of people that are very concerned about the Social Security not being there and I don't have the answer for that I'd like to tell people it will be there because so many Americans depend on it\nBut we don't know what the future holds and we don't know who's going to be in the office and how the Congress looks at it and what our debt looks like and uh you know we're already and Chileans in Chile and seemed to have a country\nAnd um you know these are the kind of thing so you you want to really be self sustaining rather than having to depend on other people for income\nI've had I've had people with pension plans um that come in and they moved to Flagstaff and you know we were looking at their pension and is about six months ago you know they came in at what am I a prospective clients came in\nAnd he said I just received this letter from my pension company which is that they are going under\nNow and so there's a what's called the pension guarantee fund but uh you don't get a hundred percent replacement\nSo because they're going under they ended up receiving a significant less amount of money so you know these are the things I'm not saying this is a scary it's an awareness thing and people should be aware because you know used to get ahead in the sand it doesn't mean the problem is going to go away you know\nGarish we're talking today with Josh why he owner and founder of for a financial group if you have questions about some of the things we've been talking about maybe you are concerned that you don't know what the backup plan is if you happen to get notification that's not your income in retirement isn't going to be there as we were just talking about\nNineteen eighty six eighty two fifty five and nine to age cutest chick eight to five five or nine to eight to ... talk\nTo reach ... and the team at more financial group\nGarnish how do you help somebody planned for some sort of a shortage in income or some sort of gas whites gave inheritance isn't going to come through this tension and going to be what you thought it was how do we pay for all those big unknowns\nLike the first thing so let's assume if I'm sitting down with you and your husband and we're sitting down and talking first um I Would let's say you're in pre retirement stage and you're not there yet but if you're in pre retirement stage\nA that is the time I highly recommend I mean people should have a financial advisor period say in a good financial advisors going to help you through your accumulation to the preservation to the distribution phase and you know you'll maintain a relationship\nBut if you and I were sitting down with your husband we will be talking about what does your pension looked like if you had a pension what does that looked like because a lot of people don't know\nWhich option to choose in retirement for pension benefits or I run into people that had made decisions on their own there so this is the highest pension benefits\nAnd what ended up happening was the elected the wrong pension benefit meaning\nThat they are the only person that was going to receive it\nAnd you know unfortunately you know if that person died\nThe surviving spouse gets nothing oh no oh God and you know in ... people have done that or they picked an option where the surviving spouse gets about sixty percent of what they were getting\nIn the problem with that is the surviving spouse is still going to need income mhm and you know that that is a really poor place to leave someone that you love if you don't love 'em then pick the first one you know [laughter] I'll just get hit by a joke [laughter]\nBut you know everybody that he is married and in cares about their family they want to make sure that the surviving person goes that surviving person has adequate income of course I'm also with Social Security benefits you know when do you take it in\nYou know what is the best way to get Social Security benefit because one of the things that we also run into is that when people are electing Social Security auctions the ... which is the right one and so we actually use software and reduce implanted with our clients show which was the best option for them\nAnd I want to take a step back and just say the reason or show it was called the retirement roadmap show is because we playing ... you know this is retirement to us is a journey\nThat journey that you've never been on before so there's a lot of small moving parts that most people don't realize that we kind of take that into consideration I mean twenty seven years in this industry I mean we've ... we've seen it all we've done at all and so we kind of help put the pieces of things that people don't even think about\nInto play and show them what that's going to do for them how to take the best option their pension how to select the proper Social Security benefits because people don't know should I take it a sixty to do to get at sixty seven to eight to Seventy\nWhich feels counter intuitive you want to help your kids but you can't help them if your incapacitated\nCorrect and so part of the planning a is understanding where your money's going in once you understand where that is going\nAh it makes life a lot easier so you're not just him possibly going out and spending money on something that you need but you can plan for those things and it doesn't take that long for me to sit down and help you do that\nBut it's important that regardless you use me do it yourself or get a program on line whatever it is but having a plan to understand exactly where the money's going to be ... that's going to be extremely important because that's going to lead you into what your retirement spending is going to look like and what's funny and what's not fun right\nRight it to get started on this retirement roadmap west ... and the team that bar financial group nine to age ... cheese steaks eighty two fifty five is the number for you to call again Ninety late cutest chick eighty two fifty five or nine to ... to to sex talk\n... let's talk a little bit about how we can manage risk heading into retirement so many people are so concerned about volatility and what could happen next in the markets how do we manage that risk\nYou know it's very carefully ... there was actually you know the retirement roadmap plan by the way we didn't talk about a bill collector that you haven't retirement which is the IRS oh yeah they're ... they're going to want their\nPeace I mean if you're inefficient you going to pay in the highest tax dollars the highest amount in taxes and you know working with a professional that can actually help\nWhat we do we help our clients create an income planted retirement to understand what their tax pictures going to look like now one thing we did talk about is that two of the largest assets my clients have is their home in their retirement accounts\nThis money in a retirement account has never ever ever been taxed before when you take a penny out of that account it's taxable Mm maybe taking more out of it is going to be more taxable\nBut here's the other kicker about the debt collector the IRS not only is going to tax that portion of your money but depending on what your income is in retirement\nUp to eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits could become taxable and originally when FDR\nPlanned this you've signed the bill for Social Security your Social Security benefit was supposed to be one hundred percent tax free not anymore not anymore\nYou know so so those are that that's one aspect of of you know that's a big part you know that's a big bill collector that's worse than having to mortgage but then we talked about risk management right so when I Do a retirement roadmap plan for the people that I'm working with right\nWhat I'm doing is I'm really identifying how much money they need to earn as a minimum\nIn order for them not to run out of money in retirement take into consideration inflation taking into consideration the Medicare part a and B payments\nPart B and supplements and all that uh taxes they may have life insurance they may have long term care and all that stuff so we're planning for those things and you know one here's one thing I find\nThere's so many people that I come across do not have life insurance or any kind of long term care benefit in retirement\nSo you know realistically if you don't have any of this and people that are healthy\nDon't think about those things unless they have personal experience with their family member but that's a significant amount of potential hit that your portfolio may end up taking we're going to talk about that a little bit later on but here's what I Do\nWe're trying to create some risk free strategy against the risk versus risk free meaning that part of the portfolio we want to make sure isn't impacted negatively\nShould we have you know the correction because we've been in a significant bull market since oh seven or eight mhm and you know we're you know people I talk to their all nervous because you know there's something bound to happen\nAnd is the short term volatility where you have a twenty thirty forty percent correction in the market and the reason I called a short term is because you know it's it's about six months you know you know the markets had lost fifty percent of its value in the past\nAnd it's taken six seven years to get it back so the short term volatility has a long term impact on people's portfolio and if you aren't paying attention to that that is what's going to make another way you're going to run out of money in retirement\nIf you're concerned about your current situation and would like someone to sit down with you and most

homeowner or do I do I have to hire somebody to sum it straight off\nWell generally those streets are made up of algae or and moss and they have more frequently on the north side of the roof because it's a cooler side of the roof and there's more shade there\nAnd a product that you could use to address that is cold wet and forget it's concentrate you mix it up you spray it on the roof and then slowly but surely it kills\nThe algae kills them awesome pills in the mold and it's there and cleans the roof and so within a very short period of time you'll find that the roof which brings shiny again\nOkay that that product come at a I'm an African grey and hook it up to those are you actually do have to get on the roof\nDon't believe it does I think you have to mix it up and put it in like

I. K. R. E. T. it's quick creek concrete patching compound good stuff Mary thanks so much for calling us at ... money that\nI got that region in Illinois and the line is getting some water I mean the foundation tells what's going on\nWhat it is it over time uh I've got a ranch house where they walk out basement and on the walk out when you come out there is a retaining wall but it was about eight foot tall were meets the house it hasn't really separated from the house but\nThere is water they get in between and we can all end up on the ocean and then they read it bottom on a heavy rain and then teach back into the basement so I'm trying to figure out the previous owner that had this houses put something in there like a call ... or some type that has got a hard time and\nIt's not falling down too much\nSo this is a gravity situation so let's give you a gravity solution let's have the drainage work with you and not against you and by the way\nYou can see all this so the cows come home and it's still going to find that on its way in which you have to do is stop the water from accumulating so on the opposite side of this retaining wall I'm guessing that there's some run off that goes towards the wall yes there is\nSo what you're going to want to do is his intercept that run off so we don't get as much for that collects in that area where we want to try to do is limit the amount of war that gets in an area that just direct rainfall was no runoff that means\nNo gutter discharge no a runoff from higher elevations so the way we do that is is first of all examine the gutter situation and make sure there's no water dropping\nAt the high side of this war could work its way down if there is you've got to run a pipe underground to get it to a place where it's not going to interfere with a with leads into the base and secondly in terms of intercepting the run off what you can do is install some Dakota courting drained Richard it's really it's a rather\nYou might construct yourself you take a trench that's about twelve inches deep and twelve inches wide you put some stone in a trench then you put a ... pipe on top of the stone surrounded with more stone\nLast piece of filter cloth across the top and cover with soil so it's all done it's invisible in the end of that dream that you just installed should exit the daylight somewhere so you figure out the best way to do that based on the configuration of your yard will that will do is they'll intercept the water that's coming down from higher elevations\nThe fall of the trench come up to the pipe and then run around the house as opposed to collecting in that particular corner\nIf we can keep the water from collecting in that area you will probably be just fine because it's rare that just direct rainfall accumulates enough water to actually leaving the house it's almost always the runoff from gutters and from drainage\nRight well and needless to say probably have to do some uh get rid of land it in because it's got a little green Bush's law along that well as well so\nYeah and that's a good point 'cause sometimes you can make the problem worse by having landscaping that traps water so just think in terms of water control here not in terms of trying to steal that water out to be in good shape\nI think so much for calling them money pet now when a\nBreakdown in your home you know that life can
