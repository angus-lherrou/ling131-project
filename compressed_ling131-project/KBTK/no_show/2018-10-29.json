right now and we are going to Stephen enjoy first Steve is up in I Believe it's rose there Hey Steve walking to show\nA warrant great to talk to your actually it's Rosendale were up in the Hudson Valley a couple of hours north of the city\nOh okay I notice a Rosedale on Long Island where I happen to grow up I didn't know rose I Know I Know I remember yeah what can we do a lot to\nMe tell you start out we recently adopted a rescue dog to be a companion twenty eight year old should sue poodle who's a wonderfully sweet dog but we lost our other dog with a Maltese two years ago suddenly so we rescued this new dog he's turned that we did a DNA test on he's mostly Chihuahua\nAnd a little bit of Sean so he's like a Chihuahua and be Sean clothing\nLike the combination Barker he's a year and a half old uh he's\nGreat he's very sweet they get along fabulously the two dogs love each other the problem is main problem is\nHe's very afraid it's a fair thing a big dogs he's kind of hyper nervous a lot of the time so we don't know what his first year and a half or so it was all about\nBut when we go on walks boy oh boy if he sees a dog bigger than even several blocks away or if it happens to be right next to each barking like crazy out of control and we've been working with a trainer through the rescue place\nYou know ... it's ... it's when he's around it works great with doing it by herself the stuff he tells it sometimes at what\nWhat what are you at what are you let's say you're sitting at the park you have your dog he sees another dog what happened and what do you do a\n... what we've been doing is we're really tried to get away from the situation\nHow does that resolves well how does that resolving\nA well he'll try but we we tried to get them away when he gets calm\nAnd how how does how does how does getting them away from the situation that's creating a problem resolve the problem\nWell the idea is to forgive him when he's calm give them a treat and you know it works\nGreat well let's listen to me carefully okay the dog we acts like ooh Joe he sees another dog and he goes crazy with the train it tells you to do is remove them from that area and calm him down and give them a treat what did you just do\nYou I heard before it's reinforcing\nExactly just totally dog that that's what happens here's what you need to do and it's just so important to understand that when you have a dog beach reacting you need not to react to meet you react you're creating more reaction on the dog's part\nThe mid ... yeah the mini your dog sees another dog and starts reacting you tense up you pull back on a leash as long as you pull back on a leash he's going to pull forward on a leash becomes a tug of war making\nHim more certain that guard dogs are trained what you need to do is when you're walking him and you take them for a walk you should follow your trainees instructions and do your basic training dogs need to know how to he'll sit stay down income I understand that but as long as you react\nTo the dogs misbehavior\nIn some way where he is getting attention for in a treat for it you're not going to resolve the problem\nHere's the resolution your dog learns how to learn to understand that when he walks past the big dog\nNothing is going to happen nothing good is going to happen nothing bad is going to happen nothing is going to happen so here's what you do when you're walking your dog and he sees another dog he's ... he's a Chihuahua mix so he's on a horse\nAnd you're walking path not a dog and he starts reacting rather than stop rather than say anything you just continue walking if you want you can say it's known you concern and don't stop\nOnce you're on the block or so away passing him a pat on the head if you want don't make 'em do any training at that point\nBut the bottom line is he starts to learn there's no need to react that way\nYou're reacting to his reaction the resolution to behavioral issues get the dog not to react in the first place\nAnd the way to get the dog not reacted to let him know that this is no big deal so your trainer is is okay and I know what you're saying and a lot of training approach it that way but the red and let me tell you I have taken dogs out of the worst dog fighting rings in New Jersey and New York\nI have worked with dogs that have been on the streets in South central LA that dog fight every day of the week that is the resolution not being tough with them not being asserted with them not taking them to a different area\nBut making them understand that walking past ... nothing's going to happen therefore there's no need to react disaster resolution I Would recommend\nIt makes sense but I've just weren't question out there when he polling and pulling and parking like standing up and all this is like direct to get him to keep walking is basically dragging him along the street but you're not going to just walk it it's not as gentle barking\nWhen we bought here's here's what you need to do you need to walk them in a situation where let's say you were I don't know where you live and maybe there's a a dog park or maybe there's an area where people walk their dogs\nWhen you started out working in an area where he's not right on top of the dark and other words maybe a hundred yard he's not reacting to the dogs at all after you've done that for a couple of days and he's not reacting\nAnd get a little bit closer he's reacting go back to the further distance little by little when he realizes that nothing bad can happen he's just going to stop doing it's always told me a little bit of disappointing is going to the other dogs you don't want to react that way\nAnyway follows you see if I'm gonna put you on hold I'm gonna send you a copy of how to get your doctor do you want to appreciate the phone call about everyone in New York for me I'm worried that science this is the patch\n[noise]\nMy own hugs and kisses supplement for your dogs

panic because she opened up in the white powder gone on her hands they shut down the condominium all that stuff Senator Susan Collins received the so called rice and white powder this is terrible it's awful\n... are you aware of this is going on is the media cover it like they cover the full bomb attacks\nBy stays or ... not even close both of these events are terrible those responsible should be held to account there's been several arrest of individuals or a Democrat and activists on the left who have sent these substances\nTo the Trump children to the secretary of defense to the president the vice president the press secretary and other Republican lawmakers\nAnd the media knows about it but they don't cover it because the perpetrators were on the left I Want to equal treatment of all this those in Charlottesville can deal with this for a moment\nThe president said there's good people on both sides you know what he was referring to he was not referring to the tiki carrying torches\nBy the white nationalist and the races marching around shouting racial slurs about Jews or by the way the president's grandchildren are Jewish he was talking about those who want to keep Confederate monuments\nThose who want to keep Confederate Mt ... mind you might see said those good people on that side and there's good people on the side more protesting that think the Confederate monuments out to be taken down but because that charges not explosive enough\nThe left in the media keeps saying that the president said there's good people on both sides he was not referring to the white nationalist\nHe was referring to those who wanted to keep Confederate monuments now from bill counting EMS perspective\nI I don't like the idea of Confederate monuments 'cause they declared war on my country the United states of America and killed something in the range of six hundred thousand Americans and by the way those Confederate so did that road Democrats\nThey you know the Ku Klux

to\nWear those southerners who wanted to keep southern monuments\nOn the other side where those protesting he was not referring to the white nationalist caring tiki torches shouting racial and ethnic

of these people's miles I as I Am convinced that every day that I turn on the TV in any one of these mainstream news shows I'm watching a medical miracle because these people are actually from functioning you're working brain\nWell ... ... if one of the national channels like CBS\n[laughter] from a route to the top of the tree would become conservative and say when I watch ABC NBC CBS they're all exactly the same news if one of them would come become a conservative channel their ratings were double and triple overnight but I don't know what it is about New York Los Angeles\nThey

American strength I liked the fact the unemployment rate is very low I liked the Supreme Court and federal judges being imported\nBy Trump I liked the idea of tax cuts less ... less regulation those are things most of us believe in but not the national media that's invested in the either the\nPolitical assassination or the elimination from office of Trump and Pence and whoever else in Hollywood ABC NBC CBS him all the movies it's disgusting\nIf I can do anything because that's where their parents just that's where they get all their money from\nI think my point is if CBS would flip and become conservative they would make more money because they're more ratings you know it's all about ratings and revenues but but it's the same hodgepodge when I watch ABC NBC CBS MSNBC CNN Washington Post New York times it's all the same stuff\nAnd about ten to Fifteen Percent of the media's conservative and we're doing quite well because of\nBecause we feed a narrative\nOf moderate to conservatism which is where most of the American people are mad most of us are moderate to conservative which is why do the great majority of governors in office hours in the country are Republican but I I don't understand why someone doesn't say one that we become objective one objective lazy\nBecause since ... every boy the together\nFormat I I don't know what changes because if the experts

I waive elder elder rent that little\nIs terrible all of that as bad as we should words have power I understand yeah they do but what you're hearing right now is a narrative about people who\nI protect people's rights for hate speech if you want to say that you hate so and so I'm going to go out there and fight for you because we live in a country where our speech is protected and what's being done now if you listened very carefully you listen it's very quiet you can listen\nThat they're trying to say and this is the news media narrative that is being fun\nThat words are going to now influence people's behavior and what slippery slope does that bring it down\nIt brings it down to the limitations of speech and you know once we started doing that we lose who we are in the country and we cannot be intimidated by these crazy people we have to fight them and we have to prosecute them hard and I think Trump calling for the death penalty on the Senate got killer is absolutely appropriate absolute courses\nSo here's the thing that happens though Jennifer comes to my mind is that listen to you that the the thing that shuts these\nOutfits down first of all this guy raised about a million bucks on a some kind of a I think it was a ... page last year but that means that there are\nPeople who were following him that I agree with this guy a guy the shooter or the the creator of the ... the creator of the website and I'm not talking about the shooter I'm Talking with a website\nSo uh but the other side of the coin is that if you really feel strongly about this you don't have to you don't have to you're not required to do business with somebody like this if you don't agree with someone not shutting them down just don't do business\nLike a radio program on TV program or whatever you don't like it don't buy the book\nThat's it period\nNot somebody artificially shutting somebody that I didn't do something [noise] [noise] that um I Hope will be instructive for a couple of minutes I Lived in some stats now is I'm just talking to you and I actually did this last night\nA couple of weekends ago or if you go back through the four largest\nProblems we've had with shootouts the last maybe months let's take the last month New York city not one single shooting in the entire city for the past three Friday Saturday Sunday nights have you compare that to the\nThe last three or four weeks in in the Memphis\nWe're about one tenth of a number of people live is in New York seven people were shot and killed\nAll seven of the victims were men six of the dead were between the ages of twenty three and forty nine\nAnd then you look at Chicago over the same weekends Seventy two people shot\nIn Chicago in that same period so how come shoot 'em ups in carnage in Memphis how come should ups and carnage in Chicago and how come no shoot ups in New York\nA lot of people will point to the fact that there are um the police are better in New York uh there's not as much gun\nAllowance I don't know what the law is or what the rules are\nThe New York have one way in and one way out and that's why you don't these in New York New York ... in the city at least yeah right\nSo I mean certainly did we a deadly weekends are not exclusive to Chicago in Memphis you can see that some things like Baltimore's a couple of weeks ago didn't they have in September\nShootout in Baltimore were a number of people got killed 'em but\nThe the the the weather in New York City has the best training for police or whether it has the same as you suggested the public buildings runway in one way out whether they'd curbs of it certainly is worth thinking about for me anyway why it is there's such a difference\nIs there is solution to gun violence and the New York has it why isn't it being replicated is the question from someone who are pulled the records of these cities back to Nineteen Ninety six and looked at the shootout and the biggest\nChange happened\nWhen Bloomberg was mayor of New York the rules changed in New York or at least more action the focus of the city to make things like you just suggested a reality make it safer not lots of noise but they just do it\nWhatever it is is that you see this is where you get to blow hards who want to talk about gun control of the blow hards who say it's this or they say that it's that\nIt's just talk action action action and they have action in New York they've made it safer in New York police presence whatever it is so why can't these other cities by God Chicago is an outrage\nIt really is it's become a national joke 'cause it's so violent there but we are in the\n... we have a valley I mean a violent society by on his streak in us but New York has dealt with it and I think a lot of people could learn from it I don't know about Los Angeles I don't remember much I don't hear even though I'm they're part of the I don't know that there's a whole lot of violence in Los Angeles I\nCan't put my finger on anything crazy lately is their Jennifer\nThere's always violent ... is that what I mean you know the violin no I think there's you know there's a month and drugs and gangs

that crazy what's going on over here yeah call you a psychic friend\nUm that's when I get calls but I've been doing a lot of clearing out uh recently\nA lot of negativity begets negativity so you've got all of that going on all over the United states in the world and it actually brings them out even more so because they're mostly negative they're stuck there are they're frustrated they're angry\nOr they're resentful right and misery enjoys company so they look for everybody else's miserable too so that's why I'm more of a coming out now\nA ... because it is a ... game and the celebration of them with thinking about them so it brings to the surface and especially the way we celebrate Halloween with ghosts and goals right the\nRise silly or frankly your there's much more to this is you're pointing out I'm I'm not against having a good time I think Halloween the way we celebrate is just plain stupid or there are as you pointed out the all Hallows eve or the significance of people who are stuck\nHere uh and so I thought perhaps we ought to talk about what happens when somebody from the other side is trying to\nTouch into us a lot of people deny that they have ... the psyche connection even though I think you and I were on the same page would agree that we all have it it's tapping into it it's understanding it's his letting it come in there's so much here\nAround Vincent that people don't want to admit to them so that you know even the simplest of contacts the shiver that you get in your shoulder when somebody actually used to meet again that's a communication and a lot of people that you know I just got chilly you know [laughter]\nNo that's right they want to talk themselves out of it so that everybody knows without into wishing we wouldn't even be able to survive so intuition and psychic and this is the exact same thing 'cause you tapping into the same place\nBut has this psychic I have learned to open the doorway and hear a little bit more\nSo yes it and and those in spirit they're just as much as we missed them they miss us they want to talk with us because they know what they've left behind whether they've left behind some mistakes are lower choices that they made or even some abuse\nRight they want to help us fix that they want to help us get through our lives and understand ourselves even more so because when you get to the other side you\nSee the big picture and you're like smacking yourself in the head going oh my gosh I should add a V. eight\nUm and and you've got all this disappointment than what you've left behind\nSo they're around this constantly we smell them okay that's interesting because I get a lot of clients as well as my self uh that will smell the aroma of past loved ones I mean my father had a distinct\nOdor and cologne that he always war and when I when I ... at every so often I Will get a whiff of it and I don't deny it I don't say oh that's drawn\nOut with a gentleman toy I ... my ... to say hello to him\nI doesn't always have something necessary to said to me but with others there's always a comforting feeling there's always a a a this trying to get some information and the person starts feeling more gut feelings or whisper in the air\n[noise] many times people are driving or they're doing something and they get distracted and at the last minute something makes them turn their heads and it's a good thing they did because they kept from hurting somebody else or running into somebody that's usually the whisper in our ear going look you know and and sometimes when we're not thinking about it\nWe do we go and look you know and and then we go away why did I Do that okay never mind well thank goodness I did\nWell in your gut is very important I Am curious as to I I ask this of people who I Do a um\nA focus on this sort of thing every week on a program called your hidden power\nAnd the fact that people realize they have this sort of thing the development sort of thing and they can use this sort of thing I Wonder and I often ask this\nHow do you turn it off like you and I am in your conversation now have you dug into me can you feel something for me and do you not want to we just want to have a conversation here but can you help yourself\nFrom figuring out what the person is all about that you're talking to whether it's here maybe in the grocery store you're driving and you'll get somebody to your left is you're going down the street or where to stop and where does it begin\nOh that's an excellent question and there's too many psychic medium to turn around and say I can't control this thing and think it's a gift that you can't control it\nActually if you can't control this thing you also can't control your life a ... hour\nAnd think it's a gift that you can't control it actually if you can't control this thing you also can't control your life\nAh ... our brain has a filtration system naturally so you're not paying attention to all the stimuli that's coming in at once\nYour vision you're hearing your taste smell your feeling you're not doing that all at once you usually do two of the time because it will be an an an overwhelming amount that stimulation coming into you well it's the same with the psychic sense\nAnd you can actually consciously and knowingly keep it off so rather than me turning it off like right now okay I'm getting on the phone with\nWith Doug I don't want it happened to him I don't have to do that I'm automatically off until I open it up ... and when I open it up the difference is I'm paying attention then\nTo another sense so just like you can I Want you to pay attention to what you're smelling right now you can direct all your focus to your smell sense I Want you to pay attention to what you're hearing right now and you can pay attention to that it's not that all of a sudden you go blind and you go\nUm if you don't feel anything else but what you're doing is you're just paying attention\nThat's exactly what I Do with my sense is I pay attention to it and listen we don't sit and listen enough\nAs long as your brain is chattering you can't hear the intuition or feel of a gut feeling so you'll have to sit quietly what is that what is that that I'm feeling oh I Need to go over here that today I'll make an appointment and I'll and I'll call the doctor and I'll go there you know today the doctor's appointment that so\nYou're absolutely right listening to the gut feeling is vital\nMouth a matter of just focusing on it so no I did not reading you or anybody else until I Want to\nOkay so here's let me just go back to what you said a moment or two ago and I give you an example but I have more people not to be in denial when they have the same experience\nYesterday I was driving I have a farm in addition to being a broadcaster I'm a farmer and I was delivering have a to a fellow in a different part of the state and I had actually it was driving all day long they're delivering picking up and doing that sort of thing and I as I'm driving along I my dog with me and I'm listening to the radio\nAnd it's not the first time it happens frequently but somebody came in to my mind into my thoughts and I felt the

of the Labor Day and well let me ask you this real quick bikes are gotten this thing are they still around\nSo yeah so the program has a kind of concluded it was a six month pilot program ... it has concluded and a spin has taken their inventory back\nOkay and now they're going to be in discussions with the city and other providers to what it might look like in the future but they'll take all the data from the six months they'll kind of pulled altogether but yet the bicycles are no longer in the community unless there's some hadn't been tripping over them over the ... here you know I I actually I saw their remarks at a company had\nSaid something I was just calling us from memory but I sure it wasn't a wasn't viable economically I think is what I remember\nFrom them yet we have not got the final report we thought it was a good demonstration project I mean I had mixed results of course you've got comments on both sides but\nUh you know we'll see where it goes and then I think you're right if it's going to be viable for any company it's going to make money and it's gonna have to be productive and successful so a good pilot project I'm I Know we have our differences there but we'll see what happens for certain things\nIn the demo derby up you know they're going to did you hear that I had on a Coconino county board of supervisors gym part I heard the show yeah talking about the ... yeah I'm trying to get that revitalized and and and bringing it but I the first thing I he wants to redo the horse track and that's up at talk ... dot com they stopped the races when the economy tanked right\nUm but I started thinking about your you and and the lights club right right and does that mess if they make that thing too nice\nI mean once you bashing cars and remember we crashing the infield not a racetrack are but I Will tell you he made a comment that they might bring it back from war all day I Would have a pigeon I'm gonna go back and put my comments and on his master plan proposal yeah I'm a one on the fourth of July again I mean that's where the horse races traditionally\nWhich I think was a great fourth of July of ... for the city of Flagstaff so I Hope the county can get those resurrected and it would be awesome if we could have a horse races over the fourth holiday but I like\nThe one really good and I think first of all I think the posed as maybe two two or three down right now I talk with Jeff dot com and I put a link in their right to the master plan you got a comment if you want horse racing back\nUh you got to do it by October thirty first yeah I'm renting and what I liked that because the first thing I asked Jim was um is is who's going to fund the horse you know I I don't want to subsidize right if if you're going to do it and he seemed to think hey they're going to be able to make it work we sign road\nReturn we see that there will be successful in the works I think the county really done a good effort of trying to get as many um good uses outta that park they have that overland expo now they've got the snow park during the winter season I mean they're\nTrying to use up part to a better potential the tracks the open space so yeah they could resurrect a horse races what a great when we were kids you remember I mean I was going out to the horse races for the fourth so yep I'm all support and Dell make sure I get my comments in before Wednesday and uh it would really really cool to at least entertain the thought of workers it's coming back\nOr folks likes a city councilman Scott over ten is with me eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one or less knock this one out of the way because we've got to go to break pretty clear it'll save you when we go to break for proposition for twenty two I didn't bring in for that one but this is the what we call the Robin Hood taxi\nYeah let's let's talk about all the proposition\nGot a great but yeah for twenty two I Am a ... you know still\nA in a position that I I Can't support for twenty two I I really wasn't in favor of sending us the voters yet wherever these are my opinions and my belief not the city councils council sent it to the voters and said should we take secondary ... property tax\nAnd garner twenty five million dollars to throw it more affordable housing we're all sympathetic to the issue we all understand the dynamics of you know cost of housing in the city of Flagstaff but [noise]\nYou know I've been around the city a long time now and um this one is just not quite ready for primetime yet and I do have some concerns that we have in the city thought through the true implementation of what this looks like over Twenty years so I'm not in support of it yet um there's just not the right\nTo increase the sales tax and I think that's the hardest to understand and really the\nContinuation that is not new to this is a new\nBut remember as a news service to be provided so what we said as a transit agency is\nIf you want to have more frequency increased the same routes the same buses\nThe same schedule but just increase the service frequency so now you're going to go to like a Fifteen minute bus instead of a thirty minute bus longer hours long weekend hours there are a lot of things the writers have been asking us for\nSo I think this is a response to that and the question is for Fifteen cents on the hundred dollar purchase would you like to increase frequency of the system\nSo it's a simple yes no question and uh you know if you don't support it the bus system going to continue to operate they're solid they're on a good trajectory they've got ten more years of sales tax revenue to operate the system if you say yes we're going to increase the frequency as us more buses going to stop\nMore often more frequent if you have to stop or off and I asked this question is Jeff mild that goes and it was the former CEO of ... yeah and I asked this question of them because a lot of folks will chime in and say hey I see those buses and I see a lot of empty um but you're looking at overall ridership\nI'm usually okay but we know there's more potential you know I Will tell us as well unfortunately just just kind of a an extra bonus university um to their credit have also said if it is a successful question\nThey will take a million dollars per year and they will buy every student a universal access pass which provide all students all access to the entire system if you ask me I think that's a pretty big benefit because you will see students that utilize the service\nUtilize it even more so for me it's one more piece of transportation a solution or just that the committee says I'm may not be for you but I'll tell you what um it's something to consider and if you think you want to help and Jen might want to consider but it's a new tax and I think that's the hard part is that a lot of ... ... if you're\nJust joining us smokes out with like the city council Scott over ten in the last segment I mentioned the pension shortfall right and kind of the challenges that are coming up ... how do you pay for that sure a couple of years from now when you're only revenue sources would be sales tax or a property\nRights on this ballot today we're going to get to the next issue for twenty ... um we have competing tax values so if you need to prioritize\nI'm going to ask you to do that and maybe for Twenty one and for twenty two and four twenty don't rise to the surface of prioritization for you yeah well that's why the community and I will tell you the city's done a good job of always going to the voters with multiple question so you can pick and choose\nUm it's not the end of the world if you don't support it but I'll tell you you've got to look at the positives and the negatives of both the questions and um\nIf if um you're right if you're thinking real globally and you're thinking big tax capacity this might be one that you can sit out on this one but um you may also want to have that bus every Fifteen minutes so [noise]\nUm yes I was I had an hour or ... I mean I think it's really become a robust system is a good job I got to say this I mean for a small city out of it where I kind of folks from Sedona Prescott and they they don't have anything nodded obviously it's a huge community value and we're getting we're not going away we're not ending service were just saying if you want ... you got to pay more\nAll right proposition for twenty let me ask you about this this is a bridge\nNow you lived here forever um I I've seen this forever as far as the fourth Street Bridge it took decades to get that had over the tracks little different because there really was no other way to get over or under the tracks on this on the east side of the city where you had to go to Steve ... and you'd hear a train almost all the right and I used to drive that all the time before the bridge\nNow they're proposing to build a bridge I'm downtown Flagstaff\nOr to go over the tracks and connect with a with sixty sex correct uh the question I've got four you on this uh I'm not opposed to bridges but I'm looking at this thing and like it's eighty million bucks okay I get your tell me why here because you have an acquisition this and that but there was plus forty\nIn interest am I missing something you know you're not and I'll tell you so here's what I Want you to do I want you to think about um ... big transportation right away to think about big transportation networks so the city plans\nThe entire network and we talk about Milton quarter we talk about what sixty six we talk about sixty six that goes through the community and all the ... and the butlers and how do they all work together\nWe know the lone tree and John Wesley Powell to the south of lone tree if it can connect with south for street which is kind of dog pound road as we remember his kids [noise]\nUm there's a significant transportation relief valve that will pull Milton traffic\nNo it won't solve all the mountains problems and we're not going to fix every congestion issue in the community but we know that ... there's going to be a very difficult fix it's eight ... jurisdiction it has very tight controls on each curb line there is no property that choirs businesses up to the curb so if you ask me the goal would be don't build another Milton yeah\nTree is a pretty good option of this so we've done some studies and we've done the work and those planters upset this motion the best fix is gonna be complete lone tree and this for twenty is a bridge that runs from butler avenue to route sixty six into downtown now\nYou're right it's an expensive project if we waited Thirty years like we had to wait for forestry it will be more than the eighty million\nI hate that comment it will be I Know it will be but so will the revenue everything will in ... in constant dollars is gonna be the ... is if you want to build this bridge today\nThis is the way to advance the revenue bond the project and get a bill but the reason we pulled it out of four Nineteen and and the citizens commission did this with us as well as they recommended at the council\nWas because we didn't want to undermine the value of for Nineteen we recognized for twenty is a giant ask and we recognize the\nRest of the court or lone tree Jay W. P. they're not completed\nSo in all honesty for twenty might even be a little premature were just saying\nIf the community wants to get a jump on it will take that revenue will bond for will build it sooner rather than later\nSo we're trying to avoid the forestry complaint of decades it took decades to where we just save up for this stuff though can't we ... there's just no you go I I mean look I mean when you say you put it towards mentioned that you put it towards other greater liabilities these er\nSo can we ... there's just no no I\nI mean look I mean when you say about you put it towards mentioned that you put it towards other greater liabilities these are big wants their not total needs\nThey're not total catastrophe we don't get them I'm just telling you if you'd like to try to work on congestion issues you gotta throw some solutions out there so the bridge is one of those we pulled it out for Nineteen on purpose because it's an expensive project\nAnd four Ninety which is the focus of our transit or transportation dollars I'm really has different meaning without the bridge in it\nOkay and we're going to get to for Nineteen I Want to leave plenty of time at the end here does armed guards for Nineteen if you've got a comment eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one back with it it's like the city councilman Scott over ten in just a minute\nJeff are that show Monday through friday at three PM [laughter] neither do\nBe a shocker\nDuring this important election let's keep growing Arizona jobs in our economy improving our schools and stopping illegal drugs and human trafficking by securing our southern border police for proven leadership senator steal the Allen representative Bob door and retired army veteran ...
