Scott mentioned Julie sweat and they have to take them as completely accurate and having asked for a one week delay\nThen when the FBI supplement it first seven time Mitch report they found that the nine witnesses interviewed by the FBI over the last five or six days and do do Thursday night we're kind of not not enough that another list of twenty five more\nOnce they were interviewed there'd be forty more and after that for a hundred more it would never stop 'cause this is all about running out the clock taking about control the Senate on November the sex that's what it's all about\nIt's not about fairness or determining whether or not you know Cavanaugh is a Romney slash Bush Republican he's not an Amy Coney Coney Barrett or judge threw part I have a sense that Kavanaugh's going to be a conservative maybe about along the lines of Anthony Kennedy\nBecause that's just what is your one when Susan Collins one Saturday yesterday and spent all that time at three o'clock running over his opinions and looked at me like a pretty moderate Republican why was selected I'm not sure\nBut once they came out with his wife and his daughters and the girls basketball team and the vicious lies perpetrated a bone in by the mother major media I got on his side completely one hundred percent\nAnd the poor guy will not be able to coach girls basketball anymore nor teach at Harvard a lot of his life has done not because there is truthful information or corroborated information in fact it was shown to be false it's because the allegations that title nine proceedings\nThat were held in the U.S Senate clearly demonstrated that professor Ford was factually wrong in every major point that she had including the fact that she was afraid to fly including the fact you put a second front door and her house\nIncluding the fact that uh there were four witnesses that will occur operator story including our best girlfriend none of them did\nEvery part of it and want her boyfriend came out and laid out\nIn an affidavit to the Senate how many times that professor Ford lied and was downplayed completely of course by the Washington Post the New York times and the major media because it didn't fit\nThis was all about destroying Brett Kavanaugh personally to send a message through other Trump nominees this is what which for you Amy Coney Barrett\nA judge third part of the sixth circuit us court of appeals this or ... or ... or judge the judge hardness or wait for you and certainly was about frightening and scaring the next nominee I oh Ruth Bader Ginsburg lives along live off the Supreme Court\nBut in a Youtube video a couple of months old she could identify the fourteenth amendment what it was what it said\nI mean she's obviously at the age of eighty six losing it but she wants to stick it out for the next two years hoping the Democrat wins in twenty twenty which I predict tonight is not going to happen but if you're dating or their calls recalls from Chicago\nAnd by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he had moved to Connecticut so she had to\nTell the fear that it was Kevin Oh but they but the notes of the therapist clearly indicated it could not have been bred Kevin you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance\nYou are incentivized to tell the truth not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when it's really are left foot\nBecause you one treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said and twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and the Nineteen eighties\nShe had flipped out on Kavanaugh and change the story completely suddenly there was one boy and not for\nSuddenly it was in her late teens it was Fifteen suddenly one in the mid Nineteen eighties it was Nineteen eighty two she had to change your story in order to fit Brett Kavanaugh\nThat clearly indicated to me that she was mistaken at a minimum and probably line Let's continue is Brian from Indianapolis Brian in Annapolis

Nineteen eighty one okay never and I had to get screened when when when the doctor was hit her testimony in front of the committee\nAfter the fact took all come out the FBI investigation even my little sister who told me you know why don't you believe what she's saying I ... I Believe for but she has a lot in some sense deceased\nAnd that they're all of this she has come to the conclusion also that she has a lot of inconsistencies and the bully she believes something happened to her but you don't believe it happened when Brett Kavanaugh was\nRunning or what happened to her once the therapist notes for boys tried to write for her\nWas in her late teens and the midnight teenage that happened and that doesn't fit Brett Kavanaugh but she projected his face on those four boys because it fit or a political opinions\nParking across the ... you know across the board and\nBoy they got accused of rape yeah okay and I came out here ... years you cannot Brett Kavanaugh his ... he he's right here down in the middle of a moderate conservative if you look at his decisions\nThat the constitution is not my opinion is not a living breathing document it is written Jimmy interpret it as it is written\nAnd that's the only way that our constitutional republic will survive we cannot change the parameters or the Gulf Coast as the Democrats do\nA ... on this and I believe Brett Kavanaugh will roll roll the constitution dictates hammering guy Kim\nBrand can I tell you I had a conversation and had dinner with Antonin Scalia\nOr ...

experience and let us bring in Joshua pie worn right now hello there Mr Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight if Halloween the event oh I Love it\nOr we're going to dig into this extremely creepy thing is like a man the mirrors I also have an update for you\nAbout time warps in UFOs or later on we are going to give away some free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday a there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with\nThe way I'm bum 'cause I've got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of be will be with you OK\nWell you know what when people say that to me it means something so thank\nGod that aren't the cycle man the of it's a small enclosed area set up with a chair dim lighting the mirrors angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd the number of other people in person in the ... technique um and it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager\nBecause I started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the uh local newspaper and I found again and again\nWhen I go into a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and said this is the most haunted room and I would look around and the two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I find a room had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomena\nUm there are a number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infinite tunnel\nRight like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light as electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of white which operates has some sort of a portal that these\nDoes it have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a near\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know what consciousness is and when you look at a mirror what you're doing is you're seeing yourself and so it's almost like you're creating an infinite puddle of consciousness there\nAnd it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of the spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to cry by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek highly polished stone\nBut there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective substance and you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience you have an experience Georgia and I want everybody to understand this I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like state no\nWhen you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional\nSeemingly core portrayal figure that will appear right in front of you head to toe and this being can come up to you and not only speak to you but\nTouch and so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to does it go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho ... they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother than he would take you through a period of time that could be days\nWhere he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find that reminds you of her and he pictures and he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there your mind is charged with that intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through\nNow when this becomes\nVery scary as when you have people who experiment or you know people talk about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble\nOr anything you know you have people who go in there and they just say I don't care I just want to see something and when you go in there with that attitude that's a ...\nYou you are well you know you get what you ask for right\nI just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a cycle Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact\nUh over the years I've done many experiments where you know we'll set up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair\nAnd so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in\nFront of the ... same mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and but you know all that kind of stuff yeah I think ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays L. E. D. left in the background\nAnd maybe some white noise I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through Sacramento him experience and I would say that a\nLot of people chores or is it is a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody\nAnd a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent\nBut I always am and you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had the full\nOn it and perhaps dramatic Josh with us we'll come back and talk about time warps in some UFOs here's our first emerging artist Paul Rubin from Santa Barbara California with a song called winter when\nThat that sounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this may be\nThe I'm going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said where of course that place turned out to be here is if the one [noise]\nLas Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me\nUm it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and the ABC NBC CBS Fox News media in Russia China basically\nI discovered some type of a space time anomaly between\nLas Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert and\nIt turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in the state\nWere incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred and so uh I have of course continued now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can uh capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um\nI mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way it was very cool that you played on\nA a group from Ashville North Carolina the rink room [laughter]\nYou know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and ah you know that's where I have my history museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very sitting to play an Ashville group [noise] but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context\nOkay um and\nI Want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just coincidence or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that as sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to view it\nAnd of course I never believe in coincidence and Stearns\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe in that would mean you'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does of Jordan new\nSo All right let's start with December twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal that should've been covered even more by the mainstream media\nBut it was not there was not no I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop uh and this was a program that was a course headed up\nBy Senator Harry Reid who was who was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind\nUh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow\n[noise] now later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and saw the very night that I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force\nSo here I Am next to Harry fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announced as there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around that same time George nap whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in the state of Nevada\nAnd a good one yes he is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine\nIf any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings\nHe goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management and safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient he goes on to say even more\nAnd this is the one that really gets me associated exotic now that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies likely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science\nTheory ... and thermodynamics given that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries an unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here\nSo he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified I've independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise]\nHe's saying George we have discovered an exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's right we we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nWhat he's saying is it didn't come from them new so if you discovered something that\nHas that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic we're could've possibly come from um I also want to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to desk where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project in some of these topics there's thirty eight of them are one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking wormholes in space time gravity wave communication work drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution the scientist as with and yet still there's one that's redacted so anyway\nGetting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time\nUh you know ... with ... July twenty fifth All right so that said now we move up to August\nAugust of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville joined\nThe mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry which is very similar\nTo a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb and they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beat two at ... air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore yes when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space force\nSo that said\nI Am of the impression here that there is some kind of amazing technology\nThat is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry that is being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt when I'm telling you you can download this information for free if you go to Joshua ... Warren dot com\nAnd scroll down the home page there's a place where you can it says something like you know Senator Harry Reid's PDF or whatever and you can you can download that now you tell me George you think that that is all coincidence that this stuff is winding up the way it is\nNo coincidence you know that none in let me ask you this when the late president Ronald Reagan initiated and

I don't think all that water has receded yet has it now called on the floor and it will at some of it will have but some yeah\nNot a pretty picture so it brings around to a new report issued by an inter governmental panel on climate change at the un warning that the world is rapidly or running out of time to scale back greenhouse gas emissions\nThis document says global warming has to be kept within one and a half degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels to stave off planetary changes that could be catastrophic\nAnd to do that fossil fuels have to be phased out to meet net zero emissions by mid century\nOr more immediately emissions have to drop by forty five percent below twenty ten levels or by the year twenty thirty I this is this kind of stuff is very speculative as far as I'm concerned\nOn anything I wouldn't judge an inventory are are not easy to have an ... one the other day on TALK more still healing anyway and\nThat isn't quote unquote natural I was reading something in a uh I don't ... the un has come see comes as far as I'm concerned\nBut there is there's a great article in the current issue of a National Geographic that pretty much outside ... outlines what's going on and some of the major cities in the world\nAnd how they're coping with is you know you hear these stories and then you throw\nThe oh my God it's not being done well nothing is further from the truth 'cause a lot is being\nDone and some of it may have impact\nSignificant sum it may not\nBut to think or say that nothing is being done is nonsense 'cause there's a lot being that in some cases some of his little puff or a\nA but in in five or six if you see the new National Geographic there's five or six cities including Los Angeles some Asian cities some um South American cities it's interesting because they never focus on the middle east when it comes to this\nBecause the middle east is such a disaster [laughter]\nWhen it comes to any of this stuff nobody pays any attention to it because it's it's a mess everything's a mess\nBut there are a couple of Asian cities that are impacted Hong Kong I think is one of them is one in Malaysia that they highlight and what's being done\nAre in this uh in in China there is stuff being done but not to the extent we've done a lot in this country I can always do more but it's it's instructive European\nFocus on this has been very serious and one of the things I remember when I first started going to England in the Nineteen seventies\nYou would go into some of the older\nThan the really beautiful English towns and the buildings would be black\nAnd I never really thought about it much the buildings were black and then you go back and you see the buildings cleaned up and I remember asking having a conversation with my friends in London\nIt goes back to when the only source of fuel in England was cool\nAnd after the war or even before the war\nWhen they back in the Nineteen thirties when they knew they were going to go there are going to have a problem with Hitler they focus to all of their uh attention on on the warm machines and building stuff and so everything sort of stayed the same\nAnd the cheapest fuel because all of the the more modern fuels were being used in the war effort so coal is burned everywhere and it was off coal and the soft coal leaves a really Harvey is\nA I suppose you could call a contaminant on the side of buildings that black\nThat there is from coal dust from the cold going in the air so imagine what people who walked around in the city of London or any of these other places what it did to their lungs just the beginning of black lung disease the population the people who worked in the coal mines\nWherever they were coal mines for the hundred or a hundred and fifty years before this all were dying of black lung disease but it became more a ... a a circumstance or a problem in the general population because\nIt was being burned everywhere so people were breathing it\nIn their normal course of their their days\nAnd so that black stuff on the buildings got into your lungs bad news man but that stuff is really been cleaned up so anyway do we get to this point do we think about ... all of the national international focus on it really has to come back to you\nYou got to decide whether you want to drive an electric car a car that's a hybrid or do things in your house like I'm building a new barn facility next year at the farm and it's going to be completely a solar powered\nA animal equitable of four and a half acre I'm going to put it on top of the building and I'm going to build I'm going to have a on the side of the hill a little a solar farm to power everything on the farm not this just this new building so\nThat kinda stuff and more and more people around where I Am anyway a friend of mine I just work did some work helping him at his house and he's putting up a solar on his roof of his garage so we can power is out and write another guy that I Know is putting it in because he wants to sell back the power\nTo the power company and that's a good plan to but there are a lot of really good wind is fabulous I was thinking of putting a windmill at the farm and generating but we're on the side of a hill and there's not going to let him be a lot of wind there so probably a waste of time\nBut there are lots of things you can do think about it yourself in terms of your own home that's where you start what's your drive higher power your home that's the sort of thing it means something to tell us about\nYou know one and a half degrees Celsius in global warming and all that crap that doesn't mean anything to anybody but when you get right down to the nitty gritty where you can do then and if there's a financial incentive which there is\nOr when it comes to solar and that sort of thing as a financial real financial incentive as well as an atmospheric incentive for doing it so I'm just telling you what I'm doing and you maybe get an idea here's something else I'm doing I'm big as are the ladies on Texas super food\nTexas super food what a great name isn't that\nThing about it for a minute what would

false\nAnd these things stick with you for years they ruin your reputation for ever\nAnd you know this is not minor posting on verified things like this should not be the way our society goes there and yet there have been issues this is the problem I mean you talked about that with with like sort of pendulum theory before Glen when swings back one way and swings back the other even further um you know\nThere are a lot of things that we've seen that have come out of this that I think everyone in the in the audience would agree are are positive\nRight like people like you know Harvey Weinstein right with tons and tons and tons of evidence\nGoing down or at least having he still has not been charged and should be um but the idea that some women actually did go and one of the reasons we know about Harvey Weinstein and we can really all kind of come together and say yeah he was actually doing these things is because\nA couple of women went to authorities and got him on tape doing it yeah with the authorities with the authorities and that is why it's a lot easier to feel good about a saying Harvey Weinstein is a guilty\nThen it is about a Brett Kavanaugh\nBecause you know

this actually came in from Pam again one more time trying to send an email talk with Jeff iCloud dot com or I've been listening to you talk talking about all the initiatives on the ballot is there any way you can post on your website how you would\nVote on them I'm Pam thank you for that email I'm almost there Pam I Do have at talk with Jeff dot coms to go to talk with Jeff dot com top bright corners in elections tab and I have a bunch of interviews there we've done with candidates and a bunch of interviews we've done on on some of the issues\nAre Pam I'm Still deciding on a couple of initiatives actually now some in what I'll do is I Will get those I'm gonna try by the end of the week to get my recommendations up but but like I said earlier in the show\nI recommend that you hold your ballot for a little while um if you lose that you can you can go request a new one I Believe I'll Try to get the need to get some county recorders on here this week let's let's try to do that\nUm but I recommend you hold those valves because you never know a bomb shelter gonna come up plus we still have candidates coming on for ... for example if you're in Flagstaff area I haven't even had on all the city council candidates there are six\nI've invited all six of four have been on the ... a fifth one is coming on this uh Thursday and that's Paul easy I'm trying to get the six but quite frankly uh the sixth person has not responded I Want to try to get the write in candidate George rebel on again and I'll I'll throw one\nMore invite to the mayor ... coral Evans and I'll hold my breath for that one but I haven't even had everyone in yet so I recommend holding them but what I'll do is I'll give you my recommendations especially\nOn a lot of these um propositions and one of them I honestly that I'm undecided on and this will be at Coconino county issue and that's for the community college now typically I Am a no\nTypically I Am a no on most bond initiatives that because there is people's property taxes however and I'm\nNot telling you which way I'm going yet because I'm undecided I'm I'm going to reach out to them maybe go to a tour of the community college and find out what they intend to use the the additional funds for she's been on the show US President Colleen Smith of Coconino community college you can get that interview at talk with Jeff dot com\nBut I Want to go see it from my own eyes before I give a recommendation if I give her recommendation and I probably will and this one has piqued my interest in this proposition in the uh Coconino county areas proposition ah for Seventeen\nAnd and it's a bonding issue taxing issue because I'm\nI'm looking at all these costs to go to a university such as northern Arizona university I'm looking at the effect that northern Arizona university\nAh is having a on the community and there's a lot of good\nBut there's also a lot of negative and we've been talking a lot recently about the huge land purchases totally what Thirteen million dollars right on the main court or Flagstaff Milton avenue we're looking at college debt how much students are coming out of school so I look at the community college\nUm and say hey search is there a better way and she explained it real good when she was on the show and there must be a better way a cheaper way for these kids to get out of school and I I I keep saying kids but these are adults to go to these two that are looking for a career change they're looking for technical training so anyway I'm\nBack to this email Pam I'm Still deciding I'm like you it's just I get to the vet some of these things on there and you get to hear my my brain working out loud and um I Will decide soon but for Seventeen I I'm On the fence on but there's a couple of others families I'll tell you right now proposition for twenty two if you're in Flagstaff area\nAlso known as the Robin Hood tax as named by former flags the mayor and frequent contributor on the show Jerry neighbors um would would tax your property now that's another bond issue\nThat's a borrowing issue the city wants to issue up to twenty five million dollars in debt and then attach that to your property taxes which by the way you've gotten your tax bills right it's gone up tremendously because the economy's doing better housing prices have gone up but can you imagine how much is going to go up if all these bond initiatives do pass\nThat's why a lot of people are saying I'm voting on everything because it will raise your property taxes despite what some people say\nThe proposition for twenty two would require twenty five million dollars in additional debt that you're responsible to pay back through your property taxes and then it'll set up some vague committee\nSome vague committee to decide who gets home and who doesn't or who gets down payment assistance or it's so big I don't even know what it is and the opposition on this has been pretty steep I've seen opposition on the right and on the less\nSo uh I Will tell you now proposition for twenty two I Am an absolute auditor no on\nAnother one in Flagstaff and they're going to move on to a couple of state wide ... and we'll cover these all week and and the coming weeks until the election which is what a month away now but you get in your early ballots your towards the end of the week\nProposition for Eighteen in Flagstaff which has become a heated mess once again with national tie ins I saw an article in the Flagstaff ... in ... local paper this weekend about the out of state money which we've been talking about forever\nBut are they particularly focused on the yes on for Eighteen money and this one's a little confusing this is the minimum wage that's going to Fifteen fifty per hour in Flagstaff\nAnd if you don't pass prop for Eighteen it's going to go to Fifteen fifty you're going to have one of the highest minimum wages in the nation right in Arizona\nHired in New York higher than San Francisco and profit for Eighteen would slow that down to about twelve fifty per hour and then have inflationary measures built in as part of the state law okay so huge huge increase\nAnd there was this article that basically said hey out of state or dark money is coming in from the U.S on fourteen folks\nAnd the person uh we've had ... he's the manager of the proposition said hey folks didn't want they want
