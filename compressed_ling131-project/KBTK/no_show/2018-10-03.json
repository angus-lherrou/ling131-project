liberty and love them and I was mesmerized\nWith your interview with John ... and I thought he was going to stumble a little bit but I could not tear myself away from that interview because it's so refreshing that you ask a question and the person actually has an opportunity\nThe whole question you know you know\nLet me let me tell you this my friend excuse me my microphone ... let me tell you this I've tried to develop something unique here which is a long form interview program where you wanted to guess of most and you ask a question you actually sit there and listen to the answer\nAnd I listen to the person across from me and I looked him in the eyes and I'm listening to every word they have to say the next question isn't written down ready to pounce the next question may well be a question based on what they just said\nAnd these are people that I'm bringing on the program who in many ways are unique or the heavy side to them you haven't seen a we had a wonderful guests on Sunday unfortunately it was eleven pm eastern against my wishes and it is a it is a program it as a format\nThat some a broadcast folks executive folks and other folks are just they have trouble wrapping their mind around it and yet when you look at it\nNot this Sunday the Sunday before we had the highest ratings\nOf any show on the weekend on\nFox CNN and MSNBC this isn't to brag this has to

format the same model and just make it louder and louder as if that's gonna make a difference anyway go right ahead\nWell you just touched on the comment I was going to make I think the ... the the problem with a clip of in this country is they have it in their mind that they're morally and intellectually superior to the rest of us\nAnd he said these debates on\nUh those other stations that I don't watch and they'll have ten sometimes twelve people and then other people standing behind them and they're stealing all of their\nKnowledge um you know that the American people are just too

we're not stupid or able to take\nWell some of them are I mean after all had a halted Schumer wind up in the Senate but I get your point most of us or not\nOr imminent as in New Jersey but um\nWe we we can think on our own we can see what's going on and with every one that I speak with everyone is so fed up with is\nNobody even bothered to listen to it anymore so let them put out their hatred and their anger I I I Believe in the American spirit I Believe in in their ability to discern right from wrong\nWell I'm all in favor of believing but we better get off our butts and vote otherwise none of this matters\nWell in two thousand sixteen they had Hillary Clinton up by sixteen points on election guy I'm well aware and I understand that but um I Am saying\nThat we need to vote\nAnd we cannot

[noise] um my wife and I work currently in baby steps to uh we started this time last year with about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in debt or we'd been because they all intents and paid off our cows in dollars wow as of this month\nYes a sold my brand new pickup truck sold a race car um [laughter] wow everything though\nWe um we have an an interesting situation a we have one child and we look no expand our family however we're going to need to um originated they do I have a we still have another sixty six thousand dollars to\nPay off and what what is your household income ah we're making about a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year right now so you did a hundred in a year\nBut a lot of that was from selling stuff I'm pretty much\nA large under what what's the math telling you that it's got how long has he going to take you to show the sixty\nUm [noise] if we if we continue on this course where we have literally sold everything so the rest of it's just going to be working really are I think it's going to be probably about another year maybe a little bit more\nThat's what I was thinking that's what I Would ask him on a cell that OK cool and so what is the pricing model of Avielle that you guys are looking at\nUm well we actually met with a doctor a few months ago and got a ballpark up about twenty thousand mhm I'm uh just you know we haven't\nFound anything or start any any process as yeah we're just still kind of shopping around but twenty thousand or we're looking at a we've spoken with other couples and looks like it was kind of around there um\nLet me give you a little inside okay this comes like a lot because babies are important\nI mean having kids is a big deal it's an emotional thing and it causes people to uh\nYou know to to change their financial directions and to to violate things and everything else so let me tell you I I absolutely know nothing about medical things I I'm a medical idiots okay but uh I have actually been involved in about this decision probably a hundred times\nOver the years and what I Am hearing even as late as last week a with couples that we are coaching on this is that when they press in they find several different pricing models\nThe ... in Atlanta is very grandmother died [noise]\nFamily couldn't keep up the house side he's moved in it and they're paying the mortgage and\nWanting to know what to do whether he should fool with us or not and whether you ought to try to buy or work it out or however\nAnd if somebody what you told me so far sir\nYes oh okay so you\nKnow from renting out Ninety five thousand dollars on the house that's what it takes to pay the mortgage off correct\nCorrect okay\nAnd the next thing you need to do is you need to talk to a real estate agent and find out what this house was actually\nWorse because right now you don't know\nYeah I don't I don't know a I don't know exactly who it's if my wife I'm with my wife is a great grandma so I Know where I live I Will always say there was a it's a hundred and thirty ... know if that's even ... they're not\nAre not like it's not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that for discussion purposes okay if you if you found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy it for Ninety five thousand that really wouldn't be that great a by\n\nI just be an okay by it's not like you're getting the re great deals are where you just went wow that's the best deal ever ride yeah\nThis is I'm not sure if I'm like\nI even get kicked out 'cause someone gated or should I leave or should I should I go back ran over\nWell where do I want to be long term with it\nYou want to own um\nWell my wife she we kinda do want to own 'cause we got a daughter she's four and my wife she that school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now\nMhm have you got into an area\nIf I'm like I say my wife great grandma's house has she been here her whole life so she likes ... it's like about two and a half three acres\nMhm and um it's kind of in the country well part of Atlanta\nGotcha okay and how old are you to\nUh my wife she turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days but we both twenty now\nMhm and you got a one child you said and how much debt that you have\nA we don't have any debt\nOkay and what's your household income\nI make about every ... here but I'm trying to get in school but I had to kind of work with the answer to that was\nThat much I don't know what else\nUm I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars might\nAnd your wife doesn't work mhm okay that's pretty that's where he's right on your budget is is very tight on your budget\nAnd we found out about you not long ago when my friend from Cherokee recommended me start with Nancy but now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff on how to eat and we're already kinda\nYou know trying to start it off a little better and you\nDo it good for you\nOkay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the house the only way you can buy it is the uh the relatives that are involved that would be the air's a this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren\nThat would be the air since there was no will someone would have to petition the court you'd have to get a lawyer and go to a pro bake court and probate court would have to rule that the house to be sold and would assign someone to sign the deed as the cellar\nTo be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done\nOkay I don't think you need that expense right now yeah though\nWith all that was the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages paid I doubt they're going to get thrown out\nYeah 'cause that's what I was thinking should I feel kind of want to actually start even going into real estate 'cause I Do construction that's what I Do know I kind of this house is kind of it's not ... it's kind of beat up and fight the last few years she\nYeah she didn't like other relatives staying there kind of beaten it up so I I mean I don't know if it's like maybe work more maybe you know what I'm saying they Lincoln flipping and get another house or am I left\nThere unless you become the owner of it\nYeah and and that's why I'm saying like I Do I Need to you'd had I see in a statement learning anything they just hurry up and now like my in laws where should\nI tell you what I Would do if I were you I Would be willing to walk away from this house some day when you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it\nYou're probably not gonna bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about okay\nSo uh what I Would do is pay that rent or pay that payment of rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't fret about becoming the owner today\nIt's inexpensive rent in the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing\nYeah\nIt's going to be a nice kind of be a really strenuous process with the courts to become the owner of this because we don't even know who the heirs are\nYeah well I don't I Know a couple of the day is this is not that many um\nOr that they actually even know about it like I said we we been here for a year so I don't know like should I I I'm not like should I be worried that I'm staying here paying their oil I just keep paying it\nIn because that's the only thing that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nYeah but I'm I'm just worried like can't nobody called me and me out 'cause it's not in my name\nYeah they can come and get you out the people that only can there the air's but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nYeah and they're they're they're far away they're like in another state and\nYeah but they're not that they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all it's not bothering them one way or the other they're not going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than a vote on it\nIf it was valuable now there'd be some sharks and the water circling right but it's not got any new because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out but some day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it 'cause some that you're just gonna walk off and leave it\nYeah because they cause I've already done paying eight and scrape the before David ... some something you know to make my life because\nThat's like whatever money whatever money you spend or make her happy is money is gone when you leave because there's going to come a day two years from now\nThat you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing the probate court\nAnd get to be transferred to your name and you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars and you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that and um\nAnd you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent\nTo a place you kinda like living\nAnd uh you know six hundred bucks rent in line is not a bad gig on two and a half acres so I'm sitting there in front of you for now\nA snow hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any more harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyways still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter and some day you're just going to move on\n... worried about being the owner\nThen if you really want to be the owner then get ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months a pain in the bud court actions\nIt's through if you can gather up all the people you need to sign on it and that's what you're facing so it's an interesting situation but my guess is it's not worth any more than his vote on it my guess is ... probably fairly close on this if we thought is worth two hundred thousand bucks\nA relatives on his worth or a thousand bucks a Ninety thousand was old and they were going to get a hundred thousand their pocket when it's all\nKnow sharks would already been circling they would have been trying to figure out some way to get that thing sold and get the courts do it when you die without a will and you have to go in and the judge has to you know authorized the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs\nAre just like it would in a wheel but it's just a lot bigger mess and you can't get cleaned titles of this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become the owner of it any other way than doing it properly and getting clean title cause you won't be able to sell it if you don't get clean title so\nThat's how you do it if you decide to do it later but for today I Would sure either to treat Brent it's a rental house how much money would you spend on a rental house that you're going to move off and\nYou don't own a nod any as what you would

after that and she was the one she gave me it shouldn't be in a study\nAnd I read through the whole study I was amazed there was a huge correlation\nBetween extreme levels of financial control\nAnd domestic violence so if you have a friend who is not allowed to go to the grocery store bought herself without her husband\nOr her boyfriend if you have a friend that is not allowed to touch money in any way because her husband her boyfriend is incomplete extreme control of every decision around the finances I'll give you a Ninety percent probability he's hit there\nThat's how that's how strong this study correlation was I mean there's just because there's so many it's a it's all about control and it's all about bullying at a different level\nSo there's just the sicknesses involved there and it shows up in the money believe it or not and you can see it\nAnd and after doing that reading the study all those years ago now I'm always listening\nWhen he used to when he won't let her touch

actually it's a few thousand but I still it or it so I Can't test that free\nOr it's all good with me how can I help\nExactly okay so um my husband and I we had a house that we've done for Twenty years that was our first family home and we have turned it into a rental and has been the last Fifteen Years and so our\nMonthly mortgage is about eight fifty per month and we are in the process of looking for new tenant and we have um narrowed it down to three of our top packs\nBut they um unfortunately all of their credit scores are in the last six hundred and they do have little marks on their credit such as a bankruptcy\nAnd due to divorce or medical bills and a collection and and some are one of our perspective tenants actually just had a um I credit card debt that they're slowly paying down but all three of them had actually\nGone through financial Pete's university and hatch certificates that they've all for it at me\nAnd and they had their Americans have tiny and they have um a parasite income so am I Am wondering is that\nI'm a show of a determination a good enough to rent to them even though they have a checkered a credit history past\nYeah I read the people will check or pass all the time I'm I'm worried about their future and handed it to the extent that their past as an indicator of their future you don't rent to them if they got an ugly past\nBut a lot of the authors of the stupid stuff in the past the question is are we still on that road\nOne of those guys are you\nWonderful day thank you very afraid welcome welcome where are you guys live\nWe are

but uh how quickly did you get involved Sarah\nOh very early on I didn't really have a choice you your voices on\nIn the bathroom as I'm getting ready every day so it was a you know I was in full bore and I and\nJust death and was the driving force but it was really easy to\nOn board so you guys looked at it and together in all seriousness other than the overdoing the day Ramsey part I'm you looked

rolled up our sleeves we can pay off the shelf that's it you know how to haul moment\nHuh yeah and we're we're a good team we bounce ideas off each other and we always came to the same conclusion as to what we were going to do and and here we are\nNow you don't have a payment in the world not that and the grass does feel better when you walk on it I'm telling you it's not an exaggeration it's a great metaphor but it's also the truth yeah very cool very cool so how long have you been married\nEleven years have you ever been dead for a while you were married ... know this summit recently now

Mars cutting in hot ... and just seeing how true that is with our daughter it's\nAn amazing thing to see and she literally as you know a senior in high school and preaching your program to her peers and this is going to continue on and on and on\nWow so the family tree estranged yes settle down on just what the money part but with the lessons learned yeah well\nDone you guys think when you tell people to key to getting out of debt is\nWell I think it's planning having a plan communicating with your spouse and being real strategic with your money\nWhen we when they were shopping for groceries would go to the discount you know grocery places ... whether it's going out we're going to go out to eat um we're looking for coupons group bonds some sort of deal when you know when we go out to eat and we\nPretty much every time we go out to a meal we share an entree and I'm like no I mean every single time so things like that and I don't I'm I'm not a big shopper sell all my clothes come from discount stores I never buy anything on sale\nThat's just how and I and I don't see that changing ever settle it can change if you want it to I mean you you don't have your payments\nNow and then my DNA I I go straight to the ... well that\nSharon she always tells me how much money she saved me which means that costs me something but [laughter] but now days we can afford it it's not a big deal you're like\nNo one else later you can live and give like no one else and you guys are in that position so did you have people thought you were crazy or detractors or did you have a more cheerleaders\nUm we definitely had all cheerleaders around us and no negative comments it through the whole ... and we love seeing you know our friends are set to part of our family it's just been

your home over you can get brand new custom blinds without paying custom prices from ... dot com always put in the promo code Ramsey and you'll see the best possible deal out\nThere you guys are great company blondes dot com Shelby's in Illinois is it a good idea to pay for the coverage offered by the gas company and the phone company to cover the lines that run from my house to the street if something were to happen we are not in a financial position to cover any repairs\nUm no I Would not pay for that and I would get in a financial position to cover the repairs it's called your emergency fun so you need to work your way out of that like we teach\nAnd that's maybe step to paying off everything but the house using the debt snowball and then from there\nOnce that's done once you're out of that everything but the house then we're going to build your emergency fund three to six months of expenses I Do not have any insurance on the things that run to my street on my house is not on any of them\nAnd if something breaks I Will just have somebody to come out there and dig it up and fix it it's that simple I Would I Do that well I Would use an emergency fund how did I get an emergency fund didn't give people like this money [noise]\nSo I had more money now are you taking a risk in the meantime yeah I mean you could something happen between now and the time you build it up but the point is get your financial act together and the weird thing is it causes you to end up with more money\nSo here's what's cool do you ever hear the term the rich get richer the poor get poorer while there are several reasons for that and it's not oppression and capitalism is evil that's not a\nRich get rich or poor get poor because by and large poor people who do rich people stuff with money become rich people overtime rich people who the rich people stuff with money stay rich people rich people who do poor people's stuff with money become poor people in other words it's a ... have you ever think\nIt's a set of habits a set of values are set of choices that's part of it\nThe other part is is when you do get your head above water and you get the you know you get Murphy out in the streets Sallie Mae has been a victim you have more margin in your life and the weird thing is when you have more marginal in your life\nYou make more money let me give an example when you have your emergency fund in place you can ... you can raise the ... on your insurance safely\nWhat happens to the premiums\nYou cannot pay for gotcha insurance like these little you know shoreline\nInsurance or some such crap [laughter] believe will know you don't put your money and stuff like that you self insured through these kinds of things in the weird thing is emergency what happening as soon as you get an emergency plan isn't that where\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nIt takes is one emergency trip to the dentist to blow your budget quickly now I'm not a fan of dental insurance I think it's a waste of money but there is another option it's called one dental and it's not dental insurance\nOkay so that's a big thing keeping costs down yeah that's what allows you to do this what other points do you have for getting out of that [noise]\nWell uh definitely you know we live in the age of of excuses you know everybody has an excuse for something\nAnd I got a lot of [laughter] yeah I'm\nJust a you know don't make any excuses we've heard a million times you know oh well if we major income we could get edited or if we didn't have kids we could get out of debt the really anybody can do it I\nMean if people don't have all all strike down here\nYou know very cool yeah that's good that's a good point no excuses just get after it you're going to pay your bills so do you deal you know whatever your deal is do it\nThat that is what was dealt with you get excellent good job you guys are eating wild on we've got a copy of Chris ... book for you as well retire inspired number one

were just like a person guidance on some things I'm so we don't have very much that we've got about twelve thousand two hundred on a car that's worth about nine or should she got twenty three hundred and student loan debt and then we have our house mhm\nUm we bring home between four thousand I'm forty two hundred a month mhm um and she's looking\nShe's not really satisfied with their job a career path and she's\nDone a majority of our cars coursework to get an associate from wanting to see\n'em about where that would fit into step um\n'cause she makes ten Seventy two an hour right now part time but she gets forty hours a week with some benefit\nI'm ... and the programs that she was looking at a as a radiology attack which would take her about two years to get down in uh the estimated ... ... your\nLab technician more take about a year to get done with her car and the stuff that we're trying to star and she'd be making thirty eight thousand after that or an HR specialists or take her about three years of a shout out of the the last\nYou know choice of hers to get done so well you know we're not we're not that much debt and I just didn't know where we should focus on first\nWell the first thing is I hear a wide variety of jobs elections here or course yeah she doesn't even\nTowards the rat pick as their number one it's a really good program here in the local areas are short now\nYeah you know what I think I hear that you guys are analyzing her career only on the short term income\nUm what's your thinking long term she she right now she works in er HR 'em and

that are kind of a an orientation type thing and she really enjoyed the the teachers in the facilities and\nThe idea of working with people in that way so of the three I think that will be the best long term for her as\nMore and there was a two year program did you say\nOh yes sir and when it would be around Nineteen thousand but I think losing remain I'm work but uh she would have to get her her associates as well as the actual course work for the degree\nOkay so really what we're saying is is we need Nineteen thousand dollars over the next two years plus we need a about Fifteen thousand to be debt free over the next two years yeah so that's thirty five thousand over two years that's Seventeen five a year and you make about a little over fifty\nA yes so I'm so much you can do Seventy

big step too and\nI'm not sure whether I should roll over the four oh one K. which at about ... broken up into almost a third with ... tax free tax match um I'm not sure if I said well whatever or cash it out it's just shy of Ninety five hundred dollars\nAnd I don't know if I should put that towards maybe hail or\nJust roll it over and leave it and say oh we get an a point of our baby steps to

Hi Anthony how are you\nHow good how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] okay um I Am contemplating going to a new job and my current I'm a nurse and then his and um my current hospital offer to ensure held a life insurance policy\nThat I think it's about five hundred thousand um my new employer fair like I tried it they operate only one hundred thousand and I can't get it um otherwise I have a lot I mean to orders and I just I get an idea or I'd have an outrageously expensive\nPolicy and I just I'm trying to think outside the box that stuck in a job that line happy because of this one issue yeah\nAnd the policy and I just I'm trying to think outside the body fat not that kind of guy that line happy because of the one issue yeah I don't know how\nYou're going to be making more at the other position\nIt'd be the same okay I'm Better I mean ... kind of an hour [laughter]\nI Wonder if the new place the new hospital or whoever has enough flexibility that they could add some insurance programs to their group plan to allow you to buy more\nAsked about that and they said the man I spoke with said that it's by no packaging hated him back the case\nUh\nAspect with um I met her and he um he said he got ... and they are paying for the well and he's about to manage buying account\nNo that's not my ...\n[laughter] I'm like I never heard of it out well I'm not gonna start buying bonds to offset the fact that you don't have insurance that's not you know that's what he's doing than that no thank you um I mean you you need to build up a big pile of money called wealth and then you don't have to worry about life insurance so that's the general principle that you moved towards a more about\nHow south at least they don't have any that um\nAnd so you know I and the more wealth you have the less and less we need to worry about replacing your income for the good of your family mhm\nRight if you have enough wealth that your family is fine and you have no debt and your family's fine without your income than we don't worry about this subject anymore because you become self insured your family's mine 'cause the point is is the family major income to live\nRight on to the extent they don't need that just to the extent you don't need life insurance now have you actually shopped or are you making an assumption that you can't get insurance\nI got denied about seven years ago I tried\nCalling ... calls end or insurance and the market has changed dramatically\nBlackout another diagnosis back in March that when I look at life insurance and this diagnosis it um they basically said get denied but I haven't tried Zander\nYeah try them I mean there is no it doesn't cost anything asked mhm let's talk about it and found out that I don't I think you may be right I mean if you know you probably found some bowed research and probably not insure all you know so the only question is just you know if your family only got a hundred grand instead of getting five underground how old are you\nThirty eight\nAnd and uh the auto immune that you've got I mean how are you know you're a health care professional uh does do you have a real threat here of losing your life\nYou can there's different degrees of it and mine mild but I um when it hits your record it kind of\nDumb down by the actual fact you die and I am Lee is left without you what's the probability of that\nLand on that it probably going on and on and get help so I mean it could get worse ... how old are you thirty eight\nOkay so I mean in the next ten years a typical thirty eight year old will have very low probability short of an accident of passing away and yours is slightly greater resolve it's not like to have a terminal cancer diagnosis right right okay so I'm not gonna worry about it I'm gonna take the job I Want\nAnd then use your fabulous income what you have to build wealth and to become debt free in the family but I mean if you're sitting there with a million dollars in mutual funds and your four one K. and mutual funds and everything's paid for house and everything and you passed away I think your husband can struggle through\nYeah I think\nYou know and that's what I mean by self insured by becoming wealthy\nAnd these are about three hundred thousand and retirement you and your house is ... ... and you get a hundred thousand and insurance so you know he is he going to be OK yeah you'll be OK yeah plus I'm guessing he worked right hey we're here now so I mean he's going to be okay so I'm taking the job\nOkay buckled because and or for informational purposes and just double check your something's okay okay I Will thank you thank you Michael is with us from Charlotte Hi Michael how are you\nGood thanks thanks for taking my call sure what's up so overall I'm\nTrying to figure out whether or not to continue to build up my underfunded emergency fund or to pay off my car so I can give you a little bit of a back story\nWe teach people who are what we call the baby steps\nBaby after one is a thousand dollars already got anything above\nThat goes on baby step to any other money goes on that anything except your home you lift your debt smallest largest you attack that with a vengeance how much do you own your car\nOr Eighteen thousand in the car and I do have a mortgage also in how what's your household income [noise] sixty four fifty five other how fast you can pay off in Eighteen thousand dollar car pretty quick watch printing awake ah well right now I'm just making the normal payment so\nFast to make sixty thousand are you going to pay Eighteen thousand do that math\nNine months\nYeah you have no life you get the car paid off or you sell the car and moved down more than two but you don't need to pay that much longer how old are you twenty four\nTwenty four and I almost like I've done this before [laughter] okay yeah so you got a really expensive car and it's kicking you in the teeth so a payoff half because I thought oh my God it's really expensive car was worse\nAh I paid thirty and you make city\nIt was it was my graduation present myself\nYeah I'm also not risen to yourself not a president turning my brother to myself if I'm going to ruin my life you know now that hasn't okay\nSo you must get stupid thing paid off or let's get it let's get a show on the check so you got nine months to pay it off with a

we got on the plan separately we've we've never gone through those dumb decisions\nUm we've never had to deal with those stupid purchases or we've never had to look at something that we've done as a

know\nI'm sure you're I'm sure you you're a a fiend about term life insurance through with that\nNow as we were just listening to that [laughter] oh and the other thing for me is when the Holy Spirit

to the program good to have you with us\nOh very good night to Georgia and great to join you\nI was just mentioning climate week with just wrapped up in New York well\nWhat do they do anyway\nWell they they had a lot of people there are a lot of dignitaries their goals from the website where that they were run it to a race ambition reduce climate change and accelerate climate action or some big notable Tony Blair former prime minister of England spoke bond key move from the United nations\nUm actor Hugh Jackman\nUh-huh the man the Wolverine spoken so quite a quite a bit group also a big public relations steely\nClaim a five hundred thirty five million people were reached in three hundred and news articles written so a a kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would and and a lot of folks there I think believe that if they change light bulbs they can save polar bears ...\nIf we all drive electric cars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build a wind turbine towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe and George we live in a in a modern age of superstition or there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo they are definitely man made global warming proponents aren't they\nThey are well I have never been a fan of that because you know I I I think one Steven I think you agree were polluting the planet there's no question about that than we need to fix that\nIsrael below showing it affects that's\nCorrect I don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think we're in solar cycles\nI think this this planet or has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbons in the atmosphere and anything like that\nAre at least for periods of the last ten thousand years when it was\nAnd we didn't have cars and all the carbon in the atmosphere in anything like that\nThere are at least for periods of the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist eight thousand years ago when we've been gently cooling since then although the temperatures go up and they go down\nAnd uh you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were so many people are conflicting without coal real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment things like carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide\nMercury particulates with carbon dioxide which is a voter lists harmless invisible gas and what I speak to groups I liked to say to them what to cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that there are so many proponents for man made climate change\nWell it it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress\nAnd they it was a very hot summer day and he said he was Ninety nine percent sure that the earth was warming in humans were causing as he was a computer model or and or within a year and a half the United nations form Intergovernmental Panel on climate change\nAnd just three years later we had forty one nations and the European Community sign a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases so in my opinion of the first thing is that uh the world's kinda jump to conclusions quickly on this\nBut uh you know for the last uh Thirty years or so the computer models have been predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it a temperatures have warmed just a little storms are stronger the polar bears doing fine and then the second factor though is I think a much of this is being driven forward by momentum by money\nUh we have a wind and solar and biofuel industry so we have dean says sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability corporations\nAnd there are over there is over two hundred fifty billion dollars a year spent every year on renewables to try and stop the planet from warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second is there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nAmazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days they've been talking about here's a one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nBut you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee governor of Washington state\nJust to post an article and CNN quote how does show Trump you care about climate change and he's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer and that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well we've had one degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years one degree\nOr yet and I think it came from the sun while I Do too\nBut that come straight from the climate research unit at East Anglia in England they the number one authority on this one degree so so in the last decade maybe we've had attempted degree in ... in Washington for a center say that all these forest fires that caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work um the way we take care of our forests ah for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous miss allocation of resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved today eighty percent of the world's waste water is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago in Brazil the swimmers didn't want to swimming in the water\n'em and they're just building the first water treatment plants down and Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nA a electricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease yet we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming\nAnd the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun it's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things you're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that you know the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change keep plugging heads\nBut I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to feel the way you do that we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\nWell if you again if you look at ... at any of the well any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about uh\nUm what was Hurricane Florence\nAnd last year we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas ah we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida\nBut if you look back at history this has happened before we've had a twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states these are this is really nothing new\nA hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century\nOther and and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see this storms are either getting more frequent are stronger\nOr the U.S government also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more floods are more droughts we had more droughts in the Nineteen thirties we have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never showed data comparing the past to the president\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book outside the green blocks Steve ... linked up the coast to coast ... first name Steve G. O. R. E. each am dot com Steve more room\nCall now\nNinety seven one coast to coast more stimulating on who's just goes Ninety seven point one the the more you talk\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether the global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box tell me about the time for\nSure well that's a this is a book that tells you what your green consult doesn't tell you a written for a general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over and think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they're forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of the environmental apocalypse\nA which are overpopulation\nThe idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction uh and the fourth is a resource depletion\nThose for fears are really at the basis of all of a our state and federal laws about energy 'em and they're taught in the universities and taught in a high schools\nBut if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been exaggerated to a very very big extent so\nI discuss the Fort horsemen and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries\nOr energy materials agriculture a et cetera but it's fun to read it say a colored paper back and\nGot a lot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also but uh uh eight hundred notes in the back so people can go deeper\nWhile they wait for size it's a heavy book\n[laughter] well I don't know about that but in lots of reasons why we put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which kind of summarize with some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\nMore weeds climate change with what's happening I'm a I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you know\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago amazed that\nCould be temporary because Saudi Arabia's ... talking about turning out a lot of ... additional oil production but uh we're growing very fast the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse\nAnd uh yeah we're the biggest producer of crude no\nNo I Believe in Thomas schools theory of abiotic oil that's the planet is got in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs in plants\nI tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time but we know natural gas can be created by all sorts of things including a you know camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I saw I think there's probably a combination of of some that his fossilized fuel but the others others that do come up from the ... of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase fossil fuels I like to use the commercial hydrocarbons instead\n... well you know one of my simple theories on why the ... theory is the ... theory is because most of the oil that has pumped on this planet it's way way down there oh yeah in Lansing dead animals get down there\nThey're finding now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah some of these very deep\nWells they find oil and you've got to kind of wonder the other thing is that a lot of it has been you know found in the polar regions too and and uh those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but I Know we have shipped shifting of the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I Do think it's a\nIt probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the ... of the earth\nWhat is the argument about overpopulation and that it's a major problem for all of us yeah so\nNineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world in up in until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy you know the big reason for that was we had declining um infant mortality we had a declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems\nAnd so a bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death from the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties but they didn't\nUh first we had a global agricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled up by a two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output but the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping the\nFertility rate right number of of ah children a woman will have in her lifetime and back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average is having five children during her lifetime will today that has dropped down to two and a half\nThat said dropped in half and the reason is we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological a sort of a state where more women entering the workforce there waiting to have children and they're having smaller families\nSo all none of this was foreseen\nBut of a state we have more women entering the worst workforce there waiting to have children they're having smaller families\nSo all none of this was foreseen it all occurred and the great news is that uh we're probably going to get the global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years and so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue and the\nBenefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles cross silly fine and it was driving to get to the venue I saw things that I haven't seen in years because I spend a lot of time in St Louis\nI saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in June ... strewn all over the place\nWhere he said was this you know four new seats in Los Angeles yeah I you know looking at how homeless\nPeople in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so that really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call waste dumps everywhere pollution [noise]\nUh it certainly is it it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though if I might if I might comment the government to California keeps making housing more expensive you know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand they're they're gonna want everything to have a electric car plug in\nSo he just had about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California does isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right more would you recommend that people start doing personally to come back to ...\n... people and businesses or you know actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going in the land fills\nA that piqued about Nineteen Ninety in the United states and then as now starting to trend down we're doing more recycling um but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we touched on before\nUm nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide particulates et cetera not carbon dioxide\nUm so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide\nIs what they're pumping into greenhouses in California to make their cannabis crop grow a bigger and faster its its plant food\nThat's right or the idea that uh the CEO to as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these pictures that were you have this dirty looking air over China\nIf you can see the air that's not causing global warming all of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gases number one is water vapor most the biggest greenhouse gas to as carbon dioxide three has a methane those are all invisible\nSo if you can if you can see the air you got to clean that up but the greenhouse gases are are really not causing air pollution or so we need we need to get our our uh aimed at the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nSteve you talked about in people coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of ... is this\nYeah well we've had a basically a rate payer revolts now in Australia just this last summer and Australia um we had a\nA Scott Morris and take over as the uh the new a\nMinister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out and leaving the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is called for withdraw from the Paris accords\nUm the prime minister Morrison says is number one priority is to reduce power prices while we keep the lights on wait a similar thing up in Ontario by the way both Australia and Ontario electric rates have gone through the roof more than doubled over the last ten years\nEverything you know my mom

I don't even know what to say about that you know and yet this is something that was passed on\nYou talked to my mood knocking that the people are hearing what's going on with that what's not so\nWell you know this is one of the things that we we see on the television or relative to a big foot people running around knocking on trees with bats and sticks\nOr they apparently believes that this is some type of communication uh between big foot you knock knock back the signaling each other in the woods but\nThis is really odd this account came to me and to me if you believe this\nIt really disapproves the board knocked\nBecause according to this couple a this guy's name was ... he was a [noise] a semi pro landscape photographer [noise] uh and he and his wife were in an area called lower Crabtree meadows in twenty Seventeen July so this was fairly recent\nThe two of them will walking into this area\nTo take some panoramic pictures now some of this guy's pictures are actually on line for sale so he says uh so he he also commented that I don't know when somebody is touted to be a professional but he had been doing this for twenty five years and never considered themselves to be a professional\nAt any rate there in the valley taking pictures\nAnd there was nothing in the valley they hadn't seen any animals and then know el ... there was nothing around and they heard a loud knock emanates through the valley\nShow he's got his cameras set up under tripod the wife has a pair of binoculars and she starts scanning around\nAnd ... to a husband I see something pacing around over there on the hillside and he says what do you mean you see something pacing she says I see something there's something on two legs over their pacing around on their side\nTo do like the show\nSo what do you mean you see something pacing she says I see something there's something on two legs over their pacing around on their side\nToo late to like\nShow he swings his camera around using a telephoto lens he's trying to look through the she's got it now he sees it and he says even though it was so small in his lens at the distance he was looking\nHe knew it was a big foot there was nothing else around there and he says he described it as looking like a ... a nervous man waiting for a bus this thing was just like pacing back and forth swinging it's arms up near uh like you said the nervous man waiting for a bus\nSeem very alert to\nYeah well a show then they're watching this thing it stand still raises its head up into the air like a howling wolf puts his hands by its side just like you or I Would do mhm push all voice forward\nThen they hear the knock you know what I Can't even do it but you know like if you click your tongue against through your mouth\n[noise] you've got at George was like only like you know a\nThousand songs louder\nShow he said\nIt wasn't the knock at all but it was more vocalization that the creature was able to do somehow with the stroke its tongue its mouth who knows you can ask them questions\nBut he said it was not a knock at all so then that was really interesting that somebody had caught such a thing you know\nIs it in your opinion is is it a blight gr ma'am\nI don't know George I you know ... aren't you yeah it's ... it's its own thing you know\nIt's all you know like in in a blue walked on Ford's very rarely will and they walk just standing up right it uses its arms and knock on the move along as a chimpanzee does too mhm this seems to stand up right all the time\nOr not so really\nYeah uh I mean people have encountered them are hitting all fours\nWho would look like a beer to me you did that\n[noise] yeah but a little different or I'll\nGive you this is this is really a strange encounter a this was called the balloon is citing the balloons citing this guy had been given a gift certificate by his new wife for his birthday for a balloon rod\nYou always wanted one I got a he was afraid of heights and his wife didn't know it so good [laughter]\n... what they want a to meet up with this balloon is out in the field and uh he was scared out of his which but he fought through it and they went for a ride and here's the guy\nOr to try to keep the balloon as low as possible and the guy kind of weight to them and said you let me know when you get really uncomfortable and he said there were about five hundred feet drifting over this farmland and more land\nBut here's what happens which is really unusual they got to a point in their flight there were other people in the ... with them by the way a it was like just him and his wife to probably five or six people in their [noise]\nThey got to a point where the pilot or the balloon lowered the balloon over a wooded area so that the gun Dole low was scraping the branches\nAnd they came down and did that and everybody was cheering and everything you know ... trying to grab belief off the tree and all of this\nHe lifted it back up again as they made it across the next field he\nDid it once again he lowered it down and they just moving slowly along scraping\nThe tree top and they all started cheering now he said you'd think they won the lottery the way the people carrying it on and it's gone\nBola [noise] but here\nIn with a big foot comes in when they're scraping over the second series of trees that was bordering a field\nBusting out at the tree line as the balloon is guided along gliding along comes this big foot he staunch out walking quickly looking over his shoulder and the guy said I Swear he was looking directly at me\nEverybody said look at that and one lady snapped a picture of the things they kept quiet and you can't control the balloon\nThis fellow said that after this thing think took several you know very long and fast strides walking in the deck on all fours and took off he hid it looked like a racehorse at the Belmont\nRaise you see that's unusual isn't it\n[noise] well I I mean you know I've heard of this I I have a story in one of the books that cold along came a spider\nWhere these guys were hog hunting so here we go back I told you had some accounts of ... feral hog on\nThese guys were hog hunting and they were sitting in a field or coming up on dusk waiting for the songs to come down out of the trees that were already some out in the field they were in the tall grass and\nThe grass was sporadically patch and all the words that were clear areas and areas of high glass of grass\nWorking away around the field they saw what he described as a furry army homemade sticking above the grass that's what they were looking at all these shows like this dome\nOf black for they were watching this thing moving through the grass in spurts similar to like a spider wanted most quickly and stops moved quickly and stops\nFinally they catch this thing coursing and opening between two patches\nAnd it's heading towards the hogs that they were looking at which we still far away when this thing

shattering the micro this this thing really looks like the real McCoy this was in Pennsylvania now and I should go clean shaven they just want to make up and they make sure they have them and\nAnd the second question I as you mentioned that your little some men that shot a big foot what happened after the break ... why would you go down like I mean they should have what kind of weapons that they have\nWell here's an answer your first question no I'm unfamiliar with the two big foot in Pennsylvania [noise] uh but I have a number of historical\nAccounts one of them was quite an ... interesting uh that came from a photograph taken from a a a grandparents' house after the ...\nFinal grandparents had died in which was depicted a work camp in Virginia at that time\nUh that was set up a after Roosevelt had established a uh the protection of the parks\nAre they they needed to start making eat grass and and access to these parks and structures so people could go in there and stay in a bathroom facilities and rangers stations so they had assembled this civilian core\nOf workers and these guys were in there basically roughing it in the wilderness in these you know only protected uh a wooded areas that were to become a national parks and they were regularly having encounters with what they called the hairy men\nAre in fact in the one in ... account in a one of my books called the hairy men\nOne of these things came into the camp and tried dragging one of the men off of this caught\nAny other men attacked it throwing a handout taxes and grabbing guns shooting at a thing as it ran a out of their uh encampment now but the odd thing is about these things\n[noise] it seemed that shot gun fire has almost no effect on them are in fact in one account called the pheasant hunters this guy hit this thing at twenty twenty five yards with both barrels of a seven and a half lead shot\nAnd he said the thing didn't even flinch and kept running through a briar patch\nOr in answer to your second question about a big what's being shot or in my account called the bullet this guy was hunting and um I think it was either home\nAt any rate he came to an area or in the woods where he was confronted with a mountain ridge line on three sides in front of him and he ran across what he described as a corn to call it\nHe was confronted with a mountains in a ridge line on three sides in front of him and he ran across what he described as a ... made of sticks he said this thing did not randomly form there in fact there was nothing about this pine forests that lends itself\nTo having this quantity of sticks and branch powers or thousand branches formed and this type of thing any inside had about a two foot deep layer of branches as well as well for me what he thought was like betting\nSo his initial thought was that hunters had built this thing as like a shelter when they were out there but that was shown that change\nOn this line that he didn't actually seen coming into the place he was now seeing a dark figure standing at the ridge which started to charge in his direction down the hill\nNow he estimated that this rich line was about a Fifteen hundred feet\nAbove the valley that he was standing in and he said that the ... that this thing was running down the hill was impossible for a man to do when this thing broke to the base of the ridge\nHe estimated now that it was about six to nine hundred yards away from his position and at the time he was a hunting with a vintage Korean War vintage am one car being\nAs it got closer he level the site on it and pumped around over its head thinking it was scary it kept running he described this thing as looking like the cop in the Terminator movie wasn't that that\nUh cyborg or whatever the heck they called the Terminator robot was are posing as the police officer and how he was running relentlessly with the arms pumping and like nothing could stop them\nEven load is gone fired a second round out that he was sure he hated it had no effect on them and they kept running\nHe fired a third and fourth round and if things kept coming at him now it was closing any squeeze the trigger on the fifth bullet which is why I named the story the bullet and they finally drop and when he walked up on it he got closer we shot it with another round\nHe got even closer to and he realized the thing was was not\nMoving in that it was gone and he left it where it was now here's the thing George\nFirst of all this guy shoot this thing in self defense he's in imminent danger a distance coming at him like a bat outta hell\nHe's shooting at this thing and the bullet seem to be having having no effect on them and yet when he saw it lying on the ground he conceded that had been wanting to do was multiple blood patches where these boys had actually hit it\nBut why these things can go now we all know if you go hunting if you don't have a moon shot or an Al Gore deer if you don't get a good long shot or hard shot some type of solid organs shot\nThese things can run and hunters to lose their a quarry not being able to find it because they can go for miles or you know they could just disappear on you if you don't get a good shot but these creatures\nIt seems like to me if you are going to take one of these things down it's got to be a head shot it's got to be in the neck or the ... or\nSomething ... much

Helmut Kohl ... who was arrested after a woman claimed he approached her while she was sitting on a bench outside of Wal Mart with her daughter\nThe woman whose name is Tracy Nye told police this guy Mr cold asked her if she was married before changing the subject to her daughter's getting ready to be creeps out ladies uh seemed like a friendly conversation\nHe didn't seem like a threatening person at first\nAnd then he started to badgering ms by\nAsking if she would sell her daughter to him oh he said he had one hundred thousand dollars and then he went up to a hundred fifty thousand and then he went to two hundred thousand I Will buy your daughter for two hundred thousand the daughter was sitting next to her on the bench\nAnd he grabbed the girls wrist and kissed it into the mother of before she got creeps out screamed and there's a picture of this guy that you can find if you look around and the the ... section of your favorite and he looks like the lead singer of Jay and the Americans\nTo me a J by he looks just like him but he does also looked like he just looks like looking at his eyes\nWhat is wrong with people I that's it that's my I don't that's my question though I mean is that where you can go now Mario games yeah\nGo ahead what are you able to wonder what brings people to that point ... is it about mental illness is that violence is it somebody perpetrated some awful crime on them what what the heck get people to that point\nLet's go back to what you just said I Believe\nThis study that's out this week confirming the link between violent video games\nAnd physical aggression and there's a debate that continues didn't never happened in my house it was no you can't have any video games have any sort of the really make any difference we had no video games that are ours when Reagan and branding corrupt none\nAnd if I had children I I Would say the same I say the same to my daughter who you're about my grandson miles\nOr because it does these studies prove that players become more physically aggressive\nThere were Seventeen thousand adolescents who were surveyed from the ages nine to Nineteen and the uh results from playing violent video games led to increased physical aggression\nSo when we're training pilots to be in the air force what kind of video games do they use for that anybody know what it's like grand theft auto call to do those are the ones that are real bad\n... known for training those are flight simulation games\n... oh yeah okay yeah I thought they ... sometimes they were just regular video games so my question to you not to Victoria or Jennifer Cara because they're not parents those of you who are parents and those of you who let your children play with these games\nHow do you look at yourself in the mirror\nAnd you can yell at me all your like 'cause I Know yell at me when I talk about football so you can yell at me about this you're a bad parent\nYou are I'm sure like if you let your children play with these game Europe that parent is violent you well I say that you're a bad parent if you let your child play football you've heard me say that Victoria yeah yeah and now with this new study on football injuries\nThat's another item of interest out this week or the or if and and this is interesting because the suggestion here listen up if you are having your children allowing them are encouraging you to play football maybe there is a way to make it safer\nOr there are of there's a focus on kickoff rules that may lead to a significant reduction in concussion rates\nThere was a letter published in the journal of the American Medical Association after the ivy league athletic conference changed its rules a couple of years ago to move the kickoff in such back lines in games there was a very\nSerious reduction in a concussion rate apparently among players specifically the average annual concussion rate in the college conference was ten per one thousand plays\nAnd it dropped or to wow\nThat's quite a significant drop yeah it became twenty percent of what the problem had been before that sixty nine Seventy percent or more reduction and the rate of concussion incidents\nKickoff returns like pose a risk to concussion because it involves players running at a speed toward each other over long distances yeah it does sort of makes sense because you're not really banging into it right\nRight right that's the hardest hit is usually on the kickoff return\nAll right so what would happen if Israel was introduced in professional football or would it ever\nI don't know that it would ever at because that people want to see that\nRight so what would happen if Israel was introduced in professional football or would it ever\nBe I don't know that it would ever a because that people want to see that hard hitting there used to what they're used to so it would have to probably be something that\nWas implemented overtime but you know with the more lawsuits that come and the more class actions the NFL I mean the NFL getting hit in the pocket book we all of these things so who knows I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility I Do think it's unlikely though\nYeah All right food for thought ladies and gentlemen yes I Will not rescind if you're a parent and you are having your show by for its soccer's all this I'm edging your child your daughter

that ... according to research living in urban areas experience healthier lives than their counterparts who live out in the ...\nTheir colonies are larger they seem to be better fed them and they are less prone to disease\nBourbon colonies survive longer than the country cousins they have a this research\nOr looked at wild caught bumblebees in agriculture and the uh like the cousins who are in urban environments every week the researchers counted the beep population in each five three times who wanted to have that job colonies in the city grew larger than those on the farm\nSo people who study and they were looking to be used for the past eight years or so they see changes in our farmland here's the most important part of this for everybody to take away it's nice kind of fun to tell the story about how the bees are healthier than urban areas but their reasons for it\nThere are reasons go directly back to insecticides\nPollutants in the country coming from Monsanto and that ilk the sprays around up type product\nKilling the bees we've heard that story before about how bees are dying right and left because of their exposure to this crap that's put on that too and it's so it ... it was a self serving part of this is the farmers need to be more aware of this because without the bees they don't get ... get a crop\nYeah so you're you're you're kind of cutting off your left leg here using this stuff and that's what this study showed eighty years\nThe look over the since World War two especially farmland\nHas had a problem with pollinating insects like bees and lost because of the insecticides that so what is beautiful country side is turning into a wasteland be waistband anyway chemicals have been shown this low rates would be reproduction\nIncrease the prevalence of parasites and to be colonies\nSo is this is very important they they don't there's no spring in the city where they're going to spray inside a building\nThe New York they spray for um mosquitoes but\nUm if that's usually not where mosquitoes are are always around you know puddles and things like that as a threat so it's really not where bees are so in Central Park they don't spray Central Park is actually surprisingly organic\nAnd all of New York city really is it's a very green city people don't think it unless you live there\nBut on it so the bees are thriving and a lot of people has on pollinator gardens and heritage gardens that that's like a big trend right now that people are planting at home and a and a lot of people are planting specific plants to help the bees and to attract them\nYeah as well we should be yeah speaking of mosquitoes young mosquitoes who eat small pieces of plastic\nContaminating other members of mosquito tribe but also other insects and mammals is another bit of research on what's going on we talk about bees\nOr they want to start with Doug disorder and then on Ninety seven was they they ... ... what's going on\nIn that sub a spectrum of life\nThat we don't pay a lot of attention to and so if the mosquito larvae by his coming along each these ... bits and pieces of micro plastic residue the plastic remains in the insects body into adulthood\nSo the micro plastic could then be transferred to whatever might eat the mosquito birds come to mind\nResearchers say it's not a stretch to think the plastic could move up the food chain in that way so then you let's say a pheasant eats them mosquito and you shoot the pheasant eat it\nYou're getting the plastic uh-huh ...\nWe're already getting plastic from fish right and I a lot to say so we're all and that's already right documented the micro plastics and fish it's it it changes the\nThe DNA of fish and it actually ruined it disrupts their fertility and other fish can't actually that's why the fish population people talk about oh well just plastic straws it so much more than that contact lenses disposable contact lenses I was reading about that last week that ending up in in in\nDrive so much more than that contact lenses disposable contact lenses I was reading about that last week that ending up in in in the ocean and in and fish are eating them because you know they reflect the light coming through in the water and it looks like tiny fish and so other fish are eating contact lenses now\nThat that can't be die generous and so we're going to have to start really worrying about the population of fish because the plastic it's ruining their their reproductive system so if they can't multiply then we're going to be really screwed it's so much more than than just talking about draws\nA lot of yeah it is is way beyond straws micro plastics in small latex beads\nAre pretty much everywhere put a toothpaste now ... and you brush your teeth

I like a pencil in five books for the rest of\nThe year [laughter] to well make it to you out yes oh yeah All right\nIs Brett Kavanaugh Kevin I was guilty correct you're saying it without having to say what you're saying what you should say instead could you look up the word accuser\nAccuser yeah because you're okay ah accuser accuser a person who claims the weight but it's just starting to sound accurate it is a person who claims that someone has committed in a fence or done something wrong okay so in at all sure either her\nAn accuser so he wasn't mocking he was stating the facts of the trial or the or the hearing\nAnd a A N\nCondensing the ridiculous miss of the accusers claim\nWe must stop using the word victim they are accusers they may end up being a victim that we can call them but if we're going to presume innocents that I Know there's an old fashioned idea if you're going to presume innocence you must\nPresume innocence which means this is the accuser your honor this is not the victim because one she's a victim\nWhat happens well we're supposed to believe could you look up the word believe uh yes I I can we are now being taught believe the victim\nBelieve okay ah two definitions of the word belief definition number one except something as true feel sure\nOf the truth of OK so not just your or something is true\nSo people now are saying believe the victim which is translating\nFeel sure that this person has been harmed or injured\nIn a in an event of some sort okay and and in this area is response ... yes okay so you are being told when someone says something I have to believe and assume that we\nGive me the definition again except something is true I have to accept this as true field sure and feel sure that it's true that this\nPerson has been harmed or went through an act caused by this person\nWow that's a\nThat's quite a statement that doesn't seem logical at all\nBut should only happen after ... ... you know that was beyond a reasonable doubt\nLike that for a standard as there what's the second version of believe um hold something as an opinion ... sink or\nSuppose\nThat seems like the one they're applying here they're just trying to make it seem like I Believe you I'm sure the truth when\nIn reality it's just their opinion there supposing it's true mhm they think it's true\nNow do you want to be judged or have your dad your brother your son your sister your mother your friend have so world assume that something is true because someone stated it with out\nThe answer is no but we are being taught the next generation is being taught to believe the victim here's the thing when you present evidence and I seen preponderance of evidence\nWill believe\nThe victim now that's not even through quarter law I just want a preponderance of evidence I Want to see it now you'll notice that last week he was looking pretty dicey for cabinet\nThis week it looks like there's been some things that the press is reporting on some people coming to the table saying okay I flew with her in a small plane in Hawaii\nAnd a small plane a single engine plane it only had one exit it was cramped who's just us she didn't have a fear of flying she didn't have a ... we went out to go circle the volcano what are you talking about a fear of flying she didn't have a fear of flying\nThe people coming out now saying the reason why she had the second door\nI was there\nYou you all you have to do is go look at the permits she was building an office in her house\nWasn't for escape it was because she was having clients come to that door and not to the front door\nI have two front doors 'cause I'm afraid not according to the permits not according to why wait you put a front door because you were afraid why did you put the office there\nWhat'd you put several after him there of all things would you want to be random clients coming over your house all the time when I Want to separate that from your business as much as possible K.\nSo I don't know what's true I don't know what's true but I certainly do not supposed to believe her I don't think she's I don't know if she's a victim or not I don't know she may be a victim but he may not be the perpetrator\nRight I mean ... the only person who should be calling her a victim is herself if she let let's just say this did happen to her\nShe can fairly call herself a victim because she knows that happened to her if if it's true right but even if it's true none of us should be calling or a victim at this point that victimhood from society\nYou was the victim is when other people have some confirmation of the trial going through there are enough information to prove\nThere is one proven victim between the two of them right now one proven victim that is Brett Kavanaugh who now can't teach up at Harvard because all of the graduate students are saying where\nIn the two of them right now one proven victim that\nIs Brett Kavanaugh who now can't teach up at Harvard because all of the graduate students are saying we're not having a rapist teach who can't to if you can't the coaches basketball games anymore because they can have a rapist ... he is now a victim\nNow that I've noticed assumes that he's innocent um no no no wait wait negative ... he's a victim even if he's guilty he's a very them of mob justice right because they have not perfectly\nCorrect he's a victim of mob justice\nI'm not saying that he is he is not rightfully a victim\n... this point it sure doesn't look like it this is mob justice so far mhm um she also is a victim she's a victim of the Democratic party and leadership she is been victimized\nShe has been dragged out when she said she didn't want to be dragged out she was lied to when they when the Republicans said we'll go out and meet with you you don't have to fly they didn't tell her that\nShe's a victim by the Democratic party and they don't care they do not care that is the real tragedy of this to people's lives are for ever changed one if she is making this up\nIts on her and quite fun frankly so is the victim heard of him it's on her\n\nLook at what's happened for political purposes only and if you think the Democrats and I think there are people who vote Democrat I think there are people who vote for the Republican I\nThink there are people who vote for Kavanaugh actually feel bad for Christine forward\nI think they actually feel bad for because they don't know she may be something happened I was willing to say last week that I think something happened and I don't know\nHow it is becoming less and less clear to me that even something happened because of all of the other testimony now that it's coming out but saying no I I was her boyfriend for ten years nine years\nNone of this none of this happened I I don't know\nBy the way I frankly do not believe her by either one of those definitions I don't suppose is and I don't know it's true\nI'm now look I could be wrong on this but she had ... like you know what can be a hundred percent sure that just didn't occur we weren't there but that's why we have a system to try to figure out those situations and were never there for crimes okay for almost never there for them so you'll notice that you are presumed innocent look up two words assume and\nPresume in our standard you are presumed innocent until proven guilty you're not assumed you are presumed what's\nThe difference presume\nIs usually used when you suppose something based on probability\nSo the odds are based on what we know she doesn't know the house she doesn't know the time she doesn't know the months you know the year\nThe people that she said here they'll testify that they were there all of them disagree all of them say I don't have any recollection of this at all so she has no witnesses\nShe ... the the documents from her doctor conflict with her report she has changed the time four times in the last four month or two months so and that is sketchy because it it appears as though she kept moving closer because Brett Kavanaugh would have been out of state\nIf it would have been where she originally claimed\nMhm so all of those changes so what's the preponderance of evidence\nWhat are the odds based on the evidence the odds are he didn't do it that's the presumption of innocence what is assumed innocence assume is used when you suppose something without any evidence\nSo no one is asking you to assume he's innocent\nWe're asking you to look at the facts and then play the odds based on those facts what are the odds that she has it right\nSo let's stop using the word victim\nKinds of conditions in the ... subject credit minimum monthly payments with one must have purchased the store just flush of license pretty

smaller uh I don't know what they want to do with it but what's interesting about this that I think a lot of folks ah ears are kind of ... is that it's on the ... used to be any use tucked away in the back\nRight down the corridor it is is on the court or and or you know like I mentioned earlier in it and another segment\nIt takes that property out of the property tax pool and also a there's got to be you know I Love the city doesn't want to cut back there's going to be people wanting that funding still so where are they going to get it they gonna raise other people's property taxes you know I mean it it's got to make up for it somehow yeah well it does\nAnd that happens when the city purchases property rising where they build a maintenance yard for example or the county purchases I mean any government age it and it makes sense because you're you're\nYou're right you can't have those into the taxes basically an organization\nThat relies heavily on on taxpayer dollars um which would be a city property county ... and the university they get a portion that comes from the ... the budget they buy a lot of money that comes from students who go out and borrow money\nAnd a lot of that is federal right you know there's a lot of taxpayer money I play why pay taxes on some interest in it\nYou know as they\nEnter you doesn't have to go with most of the city because either a when it comes to that so they can be exempt ... they could belts and taller buildings in those locations I Believe they could\nAnti Trump and I remember when he was on during the interview pushing that book which I don't think so do many copies really I doubt it I just said to myself because I I could have gotten back on after that but I just I'm just kind of done yeah I just I I don't get what we're talking about anymore and the direction he was going\nUm and he he just went a direction that I I\nJust don't want to find any common ground and try to work toward a solution he seemed almost just wonder what struck to everything that point\nBut then I almost think he's in his in his head and I I guess I should do that can can decide but I think he's trying to be that statesman who I'm going to bring Democrats and Republican and only does in the process is he makes every alienate right yeah and and you ... you saw the elevator episode last week where all of a sudden he comes back with this investigation\nOf maybe he learned that if you ... up with the less they won't be your friends in the first time you do something they don't like\nSo I'm trying to figure out is this like where does he vote now and he\nObviously didn't run for Senate because they must said polling numbers obviously that polling yeah I knew that they were going to lose and at the time it was just Kelly Ward Kelly Ward was trying to them in polls and then other people got in the race\nOr obviously ... is now in the race on the Republican side and the nominee but what is he going to do\nAnd you saw he has a plan\nHe has a plan will\nShe wants to run for president well that was a rumor that that's the rumor is I mean I haven't\nHeard a stray from just now but I there's rumors flying rivers are out there and folks on\nThis show in here were saying that quite a while ago and I was like no that's ... ... ... votes to get\nYou know is that he's not going to win those on the left and let's say you know jumping registered Republicans to vote for him in the primary uh well\nHe's smart enough to be smart enough to know that he doesn't have that support right I mean what is it it's just a a ... keep your name out there jumping on the surface enough support nobody's going to primary him as just thinking that happened\nMaybe Jeff Flake does she run as a Republican I mean come on you or maybe he is an independent that was very good possibility but then who who does he pulled the most votes from the probably pulled them for the Democrats probably wants him to run as an independent\nWhile and then it'll be interesting to see how he goes with that regard thinking about future aspirations and I don't know I'm just assuming I'm just assuming\nDo you say I vote no incumbent on then um do you become a commentator do you you know what I'm saying do you have an opportunity to do that you\nYou probably become a lobbyist and then just work behind the scenes and I I don't know some big company ... where's that\nBase of support and and ... that he's not he's not he can't run for president\nHe just but I just thought he was right on with it I'm just done with it Amazon you\nPosted this up on your Twitter account I Believe is well at our Smith um I I think I've got this up I talk with Jeff dot com as well\nThey're pushing a they're there\nGoing to say was yeah they're going to be paying the author and plays Fifteen dollars an hour but you know what I think you're going to see with ... is a lot more automation ... so there I think they want to get ahead of the curve mhm and they know that there's a big push for this Fifteen dollar wage and a lot of ...\nYou started embracing it so if they get ahead of the competition you know there'll be they'll have their automation in place they'll have everything set up and then there's the competition is since ... trying to make it work at the last minute please I guess I think long term he gets a lot of politics and that and then they also get to come out looking like they're the the good guys and the heroes\nOr you know the the the sports or the working man and woman and so they come out as as a [noise]\nYou know the champions\nThat's what's interesting and and Flagstaff smack in the middle of this wage issue at fifth heading to Fifteen fifty per hour and a lot of proponents don't get it because you have the major corporations that might be okay with that super high wage\nHeard like I'm ready to have it on and they can add orbit\nOne where they have thousands and thousands of locations they can absorb that right I quit so when you look at a company like Amazon do they decide that we're going to automate a lot more quicker and and not hire new people cut people what they are on\nThe line I think they've looked into the automation and they know exactly\nWhat they can do before they even announced that what ... what would it cost us these aren't stupid people's kind of like we go back to Nike cap Capra neck thing and ... you know they just decide all of a sudden we're going to make a social\nYeah yeah they have Alice in ... um\nBut they're able to absorb that a lot more and then as a small business as a mom and pop shop or whatever which most businesses are small businesses most are under ten employees a lot of them are just you know do what I Do exactly and um you then have a hard time keeping up with\nWith us when there's an artificially mandated minimum right and ... and this you know there's a lot of the people who pushed this they hate the giant corporations but in in the long run they're helping them because the giant corporations can one absorbent for to their competition gets put out of business well hate the giant corporations ally Russia\nAnd they hate things like straws but rather than they like to read and write their speeches on the eye pad\nTo read I like I Love I Love socialists yeah capitalism to get their their agenda across yeah it it's it's very interesting okay um [noise]\nOh [noise]\nThis is a big one the climate action guide\nThe climate action guide I don't know if I should start this right now because it may take I mean I've been afraid to read it as much
