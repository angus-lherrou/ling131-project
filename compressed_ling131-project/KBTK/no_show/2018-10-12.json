I'm now um and I think\nThat's what everybody thinks you know I'm an average guy I'm hurt you know ... lamb luckily I have a concealed weapons permanent I'm On my arm\nWell you look at you look at the interview and the conversation that came from from sooner Paul and his wife saying that she sleeps\nAbout that with a gun or it that's not that's the real world or being a outspoken conservative in America today\nUh I I have to protect myself with a gun I been targeted I've had to use my gun to protect myself I've had a significant number of legitimate death threats I've had people that come after me and my family um that is the intolerant left\nThey will come after you with everything they have a and and and there are no rules anymore and and and Brett Kavanaugh's proof of that when I say there's no rules anymore what they did to Brett Kavanaugh what they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh by saying\nEvery day every day it was something else well he's you know he he he didn't write me but but he planned rate so then he was he was involved and gang raped me didn't game right me but he was playing the parties the gang raped me well then I think it was a gang rape is any drinking college any drink in college and I think it came right people in college\nOr a sexually assaulted me way didn't sexual assaults me but he might have been the room when other sexually assaulted me\n... for somebody like Brett Kavanaugh he was the perfect drama I mean is the is part of the stuff American claim of a person over I'll bet on a high school or\nCollege and then I I don't think it will say I think he was probably a jock who was the captain of teams who drink and party with his friends and that doesn't mean that you're a rapist\nYeah you know and and and today it was interesting 'cause on the view today they were having a conversation about this and you want to talk about mob mentality or and and and I we I appreciate the phone call but they were talking about this mob mentality\nAbby Huntsman or was defending Maloney as me to comment saying call for evidence and and the view show exploded around her\nMaloney Trump talked about the me too movement and she said you know in this exclusive interview with ABC News that she stood with women and the me too movement but added quote that we need to have really hard evidence\nThat if you're accused of something show the evidence you cannot just say to somebody you know I was sexually assaulted or you did that to me because sometimes she said to me it goes too far and away they portrayed some stories it's not correct It's not right and I agree with millennia\nWell you know the view of course took on Trump's comments and and sunny Huston took a swipe at Trump claiming that the first lady is telling women everywhere your word is not enough um that's that's not true I mean it's\nI Can't support the me too movement while also saying that we need to make sure that the me too movement is held to\nA level of accountability that our court system says is that is adequate and correct that you must have evidence you can't just destroy someone's life you don't believe me look at the kid whose parents are now suing a five high school students who uh falsely accused their\nSon of sexually assaulting them destroyed is live destroyed his\nFriendships destroyed his entire life they everybody's walking around saying and then they finally recanted their stories and they're suing as they should\n\nThere are people you out there was a star football player recently there was a ... film I think it was on HBO done about him\nHe went went to prison missed out on the best years of his career because he was falsely accused of raping a girl and it came out that finally that he didn't ...\n\nWe should believe in the presumption of innocence over guilt but the mob guilt but the mob mentality of the left is if you are a woman you must be believe no matter what\nAnd the man is guilty automatically\n\nUntil he proves his innocence\nIf that's not a mob mentality I don't know what is\n\nYou can go out there and and accuse somebody of doing I mean Abby Huntsman said today evidence should always matter\n\nEvidence should always matter\nI had no problem with saying to Mrs Ford I had a problem with their story when that didn't\nAdd up take emotion out of it\nThe reason why I didn't believe Mrs Ford is because she got to hand pick the people that were in the house in the room and people said the president was mocking Mrs forwarded that campaign rally when you know she said you know Brett Kavanaugh you know tried to ... murder me and raped me remember that\nWhat you were to happen I don't know where to happen I don't know how did you get there I Can't remember how did you leave I don't know if you tell anybody know\n\nMillennia Trump said exactly what ever and this is where I Believe the midterms are going to backfire on the Democrats I Do I really do believe this there are too many mothers out there that have sons\nThat have husbands that have nephews that have dads\nAnd they saw what they did the Brett Kavanaugh based on a political assaults and nothing else and the assault is still going\n\nThe assault is still going Democrats are saying elect us to one of the houses put us in charge of the house or the Senate and we will impeach Brett Kavanaugh\nNot based on fact based on emotions in a mob mentality based on the fact that got nothing else to run on so let's turn every Republicans into a racist or sexist sexual assault individual turn them into a gang rape is\nThat's what you gotta do to turn them into that\nTurn them into that\nOne eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven when they go to Steve

physical health spiritual health mental health it's all going down since I lost all help I'm just wondering for coming by far to the U.S I think that's what happening again\nYou know so you're single okay and when did you leave your parents' home\nAlso been living or what happened is a bit on my own for about a year and a half but I moved to BC and once I got to be see I was in a car accident\nMhm but my money that I had for a place one war my vehicle magnify vehicle mhm\nAnd then it was great in the middle of summer and I wasn't able to secure work until shortly may be on later I was living in a homeless shelter and now recently the shelter I extend my they like it's been hard\nUh-huh but um where is home yeah I I parked by the ocean and I don't know where where do your\nParents live\nA ... about three hours away but she has a boyfriend going to counter me being there isn't really\nA [noise] it's very tough tough\n[noise]\nFor being with us from our 'cause this is the Dave Ramsey show\nYou know it's interesting\nAnd informative to all of us to stop and think about some hope\nCauses you to be able to\nMove the needle causes you to be able to move forward when you think the light at the end of the ... at the end of the sun was an oncoming train your paralyzed your stop your overwhelm your frozen you get paralysis or the analysis that hopelessness when you think it's alive and the tunnel is the way out of your trap and then you run to the light\nBut if the train is coming at you and run to that obviously right\nAnd and what's the difference in those two events both light both a tunnel both the situation one is you believe that if you run to the lot you're going to get out one of you believe you run a lot you're going to get killed right I mean ... that's hoping hopelessness\nAnd all of a U.S me included face that or have faced that at times in our lives\nAnd it's amazing to me the power of our brain and our spirit that God gives us to do things that are way beyond what we thought we could do once we believe that there possible\nThat's called hope and\nSo when I show you look you know you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you got thirty thousand dollars in debt you feel stock but gosh if we did that at a thousand dollars a month you're going to be out of debt and my gosh and I thought I was always a month out of a hundred thousand it's nothing I swore thousand dollars a year you're going to be out of debt in a little over two\nYears and you suddenly go oh I see it ... it's the same situation you were in but now you can see it\nYou see what I'm Talking about and once you can see it that's called hope I can see my way out one of the things is steals your hope is when you have lost your perspective perspective is of course your point of view the way you're seeing things\nIt's happened to me it's happened to you\nI remember one time one of my daughters when she was in high school certain boy did not call it a certain time that he was supposed to call and she was very upset by\nThe world is coming to an ... and her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in and comfort her [laughter]\nNow why are we standing in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their\nHopeless\nWell we've got perspective we see things that she doesn't see because we've been places she has a man and have experiences that she doesn't have right so in other words we've been to our twenty year class reunion we know she'll be\nGlad he didn't call [laughter]\nThat's why we're giggling about standing and All right so we have\nPerspective and so we you know when you don't have ... when you cannot see the other side you're standing in poop up to your knees but you can't see the other side of it\n... then you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but when you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer and it it's going to grow some things in your future\nYou know when you're walking through garbage in other words you're going to you that there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the end of your life\nWhen you look out ten years you see stuff different than when you look out ten seconds\nAnd the young man I was just talking to an end folks that have dealt with an homeless situations is one of the problem is the the desperation just to\nEat and not be cold causes you to have ten second increments of thought instead of ten year increments just thought ... I can stand back from that sitting here warm and with a full belly in my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more\nBut he can't see he couldn't see that you don't care that you wouldn't get like go go go deliver pizzas go blow leaves go walk dogs go shovel something somewhere you know go do something do you know work all the time because she knew that money comes from work is where it comes from and I can't get enough hours woven work\nSomeplace else work more work all the time but by 'cause I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does I mean when we were going broke two babies in life the houses in foreclosure were that close to homeless ourselves\nSo how we get out of it worked or bought off and well you know you\nCan't work your way out everything that I didn't work my way out I went bankrupt but I didn't lose the house and if I had lost the house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that well you know and and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter\nThing is just perspective it's like I didn't grow up rich but I had a friend that grew up rich and\nBecause he grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out considered always worked out and I had the perspective that ain't gonna work out [laughter]\nIt's going to be awful ... and ... because he thought everything was going to work out you know it all worked out a lot\nBecause I didn't think it was going to work out sometimes it didn't work out you say you set yourself in these tracks and these rockets with this thing but when you can see the other side of it it's easy to work through it\nIt's when you can't see the other side of it that you don't want to work through it because you don't believe it's going to work that's called hopelessness the situation is exactly the same they only different issue is your perspective\nAnd so I'm challenging some of your another think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career you think you're stuck in this\nMarriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money you think you're stuck in that you're not stuck\nYou're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film strip you're going to turn the page and something else is going to happen better or worse tomorrow it is not going to stay the same you are not stuck\nSo look the other side of it look out there five years look out there three years look out their ten months and say what am I got to do what's got to be true that's not true right now for me to never be here again that's a question he was asking but he was having trouble emotionally buying it\nAnd I don't think I helped him I was kind of bothered me that's why I Want to talk about a minute I'm not sure he hurt me\nBut if I woke up in his shoes tomorrow if you

Carolina Hi Jason welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave thank you for taking my call sure what's up I'm okay I just took a position a at a new company I'm traveling a hundred and ten miles a day roundtrip commuting okay\nI'm I'm averaging about four hundred dollars a month and gas and I'm having a little bit of trouble kind of stomach moving to this new city because of the fact that it's ... higher up there\nMy rent right now is only seven hundred dollars a month up there for all and that's on a two bedroom apartment a one bedroom apartment up there starts at a ride around thousand dollars [laughter] so my question is which I Do about that where your dry or [noise]\nUm I'm driving to carry North Carolina\nI think you went shopping and one of the town and there's another town Kerry Kerry is not that dramatic it's not thirty percent more expensive than Burlington I'm wrong something's wrong with your analysis here\nWell everything that I've done research was I Can't find anything less than non fifty to a thousand dollars off for a one bedroom apartment\nAnd I've been digging for almost thirty days now okay uh trying to offset the cost of gas and be closer to my job\nAgain that now I'm not I'm just not doing what you're doing but I'm a I'm a I don't have the emotional ability to commute like that some people do but I Can't do it my commute seven minutes so I Can't relate I'm the I'm sure\nThat some people do but I Can't do it my commute seven minutes or so I Can't relate um the um\n[noise] I I just I really think that I mean I ...\nI have never seen anything that indicates that carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive than the rest of North Carolina I mean now maybe you need to move\nTwenty miles from there instead of a hundred and ten miles from there to get something cheaper but I'm the numbers are giving me just don't work I I just ah truthfully I think you haven't looked in the right places I think you're looking in certain neighborhoods or certain types of apartment complexes or whatever\nI'm going to continue to shop and learn and I'm probably I mean I'm ... you may need to dial it out pan back a little bit and dial out just a little bit mileage was from where you are looking to get you may be in the most expensive in the town I mean I can imagine that there is an area of carry this that expensive\nBut overall to carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive rents than Burlington no that's just I just don't believe that\nUm I can be wrong but I I don't I've never seen that indicates that the one in North Carolina is that much more expensive than the other and now you want to compare Manhattan to apple in Texas we can talk about this but that's a different issue and that's not what you're proposing so I think you're\nUm you're looking at different end of town of Kerry or you move a little bit further out of carry but not a hundred and ten miles out of scary and let's see where we are at that point\nUm but I don't think you can um\nWhat your your numbers just don't work I thanks for the call Sharon is with us in West Palm Beach Florida Hi Sharon welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nAnd

things then you're going to you know you're going to finish off the dead are going to spend a limited amount on the wedding so that you can use the rest of his money to clear your dad when we are married after we get home from the honeymoon\nI understand you've got some shame about your past we all\n\nWe can do it over when you do that oh my gosh [noise] uh no I don't let that hold you back you know you got plenty of good stuff I had a nuisance today Ramsey show [noise]\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just getting rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat\nBeing in med school and not having any income living off loans it's kinda hard to figure out how you're going to pay out that while you're taking out then they sent 'em and then Alan and I met and we were engaged and\nWe want it to start or mirrors off rights or we want it and it's worked out in the same vision for ... or ... or what have you with a sort of what our future was\n... so out Allen actually had a when we met he had already paid off all his school loans and had a lot of savings and I'm like hey you want to get married I've got a hundred and fifty five thousand in debt\nYou know I don't think I feel really guilty doing that one girl a minute ago yeah yeah\nAnd our church I'm at the time was offering it for you and so I'd like to go to this class because I'm terrified and I don't know what to do and\nI'm so we did that in that was in two thousand twelve wish she did that while we were engaged and so we got married August twenty twelve and so\nTo this day you know before we got married we had our budget ready to go on the spreadsheet ... from the nerd and uh [laughter] to this day we can tell you every penny we've spent since the day when I got married so that's been that's been an interesting journey but definitely blessed\nTo have a new one month later ... things that yeah so what do you tell people were key to getting out of debt is well\nGosh a source of communication or whether it's with her married are engaged for years by herself you need someone to talk to you about it um and then it's setting the budget and being just went on it there's no problem changing the budget for its just intellectually spinning every sentence forget where it goes in the village and just just do it\nYeah we've gotten very good at 'em cash flowing things there's been a lot of an ... of course over six years a lot of unexpected expenses\nAnd we always say that if it weren't for the budget than we wouldn't know where to get money from ... um we've actually cash slowed three cars in the span of time um and then about two years ago we um\nWe we were having some trouble I'm getting pregnant which you never think that that's going to happen and um\nYou know fertility stuff isn't really yeah it's not like getting cancer it's not like a medical emergency or anything but it's definitely a very stressful um and so we we were very glad to be able to have the\nFunds and know where to pull money from and we actually ended up doing to round of IDF which was very expensive um and so we're happy to finally be pregnant\n[laughter]\nWe're not we're not going to call her days so good [laughter]\nBut we just you know going through the stress of that and I see I've seen plenty of friends go through that are wanting to adopt and not be able to because they don't have the money or they have to find rates for years and years and so we were just left to not not have to put that on hold because of money so that was definitely a blessing when we\nGo on MasterCard yeah that would be

Mao extra to doubt in my own shale hate our my credit card that no one has outlined in church or no ...\nYeah how um altogether right now I got about fifty nine thousand dollars and I'm twenty seven of them do that about Seventeen I met at a car loan and then I Am\nAnd it's got about fifty nine thousand dollars can buy 'em by having them student about Seventeen out that in a car loan and credit

ad no more new debt that's a victory\nOkay then the second thing would be to pay the actual payments on their credit card just minimum and we'll call that a victory uh and then the third thing would be if you can actually start to make some progress paying down on those you don't you're not paying anything on the student loans while you're in school right\nRight right and a half I mean it's almost like a credit card you know how to understand\nAnd it's a really really dumb idea okay you're making a mess and so have you cut up these credit cards um I Know you haven't caught them all up [laughter]\nYeah I don't even found my French too\nI don't care if you use them or not drop 'em up I'll\nStop using them you have to stop this stuff radically and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you probably need to work more or at a different place\nWell it can't work more because of health club agile and out of the fact is that probably make about the area where I'm located\nOkay well I ... a little more money on another thousand dollars a month to change your life uh-huh so that's what I'm looking at is what what can I Do to create that just on the short term you only got about nine months to your income can change hopefully with a new\nUm with a new job in a new career at that point um\nBut hang on until the end and stop borrowing on student loans to pay off credit cards Naomi is in Seattle hey Naomi how are you\nLike to thank you sure how can I help 'em so might have been ready to come home and it hasn't been bringing in as much as it used to in the

make a combined they get to that would be a month and now with the get down to five thousand dollar home mortgages large chunk of what we are now\nOkay I'm a little bit confused 'cause you modeled everything together so how much of the Fifteen thousand was you\nUm about three and ... are you still doing that yeah okay so he was making twelve and now he is making seven yeah no no no no no\nNo I was making nothing by his business has almost disappeared yes you do know what's wrong with it what's wrong with it\nUm [noise] I don't know what I have to talk to and I feel like a chip competition

on so many people enter the clothing online business that weren't there before and I'm not letting her up Ninety percent of his income\n\nThat yeah that appears to to break and\nAnd you just get a job or needs to fix this business\nYeah it's going to harm and option can\nNo because there's an fix the problem the homes not the problem the problem is is businesses failing\nOkay\nAnd we have to feed their fix that we have to identify the problems with this business and make the changes to fix the business or we have to get a job and close the business\nWatching I don't care if he starts selling something other than close yeah obviously knew how to sell something on the Internet at one point he was doing very well\nSo I can alert he's making a hundred and fifty a year yeah that anybody like three years\nYou know that ain't bad so I mean he knows how to do something with marketing on the Internet some kind of digital marketing\nAnd uh it may be that the product line he's into the space cesium yacht invaded or maybe he's gotten lazy with his ... and he's not handling is is digital marketing properly or I don't know I Can't tell what's going on but I can tell you this dissident heading the right way is it\nYou know it's not so I'm going to give them my friend Henry Cloud wrote a book called necessary endings\nK. and in that chapter in one chapter in that book he says that when you end something a relationship a job business whatever it is when you into something it's when it's bad and you have lost hope you have no reasonable logical reason to think it's going to get better\nAnd that's when you end it right I mean if you if you've been one of the guy who's been drinking for Twenty years and he says he's gonna quit there is no logical reason to believe him a unless there's evidence to indicate he actually has quitting this time\nAnd you you know you're married to a drunk you got to make a decision at that point right in your case in ... with this thing this thing's trending the wrong way you have to give me a logical if I knew\nYou and him when I look at this and say look at yourself in the mirror and say is there a logical reasonable good reason says that that we can turn this thing around if we turn these three knobs and get this business working\nThen we have to change the business or something obliquely different\nOr we're going to get a job

it can lower my natural levels of co Q. ten [noise] he told me to take too long it has the number one cardiologist recommended\nForm of ... a very important nutrient for healthy heart healthy blood pressure level [noise] shoot with three times better absorption\nAnd collapse of the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you were thinking about that first and then you say oh it must be ... I was just thinking about\nYou right that's very common um\nI think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or the ... cents but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psyche grown out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families\n[noise] um yeah that's true someone who say let's say when my mother or my grandmother had that ability\nIt seems to come more from the female side doesn't\nThat's right that's right yeah I in fact I had a great a great aunt had an experience where she fell asleep and she will cost and she said her brother had died he was living in another country and shortly afterwards she found out yes or better your dog\nThough yet but I mean it does happen to men as well and I suspect that men don't talk about as much as women do [noise] but you know people talk about a woman's intuition so it does seem to have that connotation that it's more common and women and I think that's probably true plus the fact that women are more likely to talk about it than men are\nDo you think Dr these experiences are from the brain or outside of the brain\nI Would say both\nI Would say that these are sort of um cooperation between what's going on on different levels are different dimensions and these experiences a protest in the brain\nSo for example if you take the example of an out of body experience which I have had myself and it was just completely spontaneous and I was quite young\nI had one eleven I've never been able to duplicate it again but it was one of the strangest\nWonderful little section I've ever had I mean there I was bouncing on the ceiling re looking at my body in bed or you stayed home from school I never miss school but I had a fever that day and I didn't go to my mother's a George you don't go stay in bed\nAnd I took a nap and I woke up again and this time I was looking down at myself I thought it was a dream Randy Raybon the effort that point it's lamb ... back into my body\nI woke up was jarred I'm eleven years old I don't know what the heck happened to me now but eventually I got my way into a library you know weeks later she stumbled\nI'm psychic Rome section I guess and found\nA book on astral projection and sure enough I said that's what happened to me but I've not been able to do it since at least in my awake moments\nWell in my case also with the ... it was completely spontaneous I wasn't trying to do it I didn't know anything about it um I just like you I just find myself voting on the ceiling looking down at my body and dead\nBut you know there there are ways to produce and out of body experience how there was a neurologist in Montreal Dr ... field was able to his mapping out the different areas of the brain and he if he put on electrical stimulation on the right time for car tax he's able to produce and not have body experience [noise]\nThat that doesn't come easy out of body experience originates in advance and that tells me that the that air it being well protests the out of body experience\nUm and you know the types of out of out of body experiences we had was quite straightforward um they went complicated but some people as you say it can be called astral projection around\nNovel people can leave not just their their body but they can leave the room they can leave their house you know they can actually traveled to different locations\nAbsolutely now do you find that the people who tend to have these kinds of experiences are believers in the paranormal or not\n[noise] I'd say no not not ... not initially because when this happened to me I certainly wasn't a belief or I didn't even know such a thing as possible and I've just kind of learned about the paranormal as I go along and as I have these experiences\nUm another strange experience I had when I was a student um when I was Nineteen resolve it and how it's affecting your medical student at ... examined the night before the exam and when I went to the exam the next day the first question on the exam is the same as the first question in my dream you\nHave the answer that you knew exactly\nSo I felt like that dream helped me past my exam but I didn't tell anyone about it because it seems so unbelievable in fact if someone had told me that story I probably wouldn't have believed that\nThe name of the book is called the borders of normal with the subtitle a clinical psychiatrist you by the way de stigmatize just paranormal phenomena tell me about the book\nWell one of the reasons I wrote this book has you know as I say in the subtitle I'm trying to de stigmatize paranormal phenomena\nBecause what I found and this is my own experience as well when people have these experiences they tend not to talk about them because they think people are gonna think they're weird or their strange for there's something wrong with him or they're losing their mind is something like that\nBut I'm trying to say that a lot of people have these experiences it's quite normal to have these experiences\nI mentioned that the word parent or a month for example the ... parent means beside so we have paralegals working beside lawyers have paramedics Paralympics and so on\nSo parent normal means beside normal it doesn't mean have normal and there is still to this day a lot of stigma attached to talking about these phenomena and I find when I give her reading or if I give a talk somewhere people come up to me afterwards and share with new things that have happened to them which they've never told anyone\nSo I'm trying to make it more acceptable for people to talk about these things\nAnd that was really what motivated me to read the book\nDid you ever come across research from a psychiatrist who has died named Dr shift ...\nNo I'm not familiar with him or her oh her\nIn a it was my aunt and she she went to a Oxford University and she got her degree in psychiatry yeah and specialized in all kinds of things and then decided she was given all that often to study telepathy\nAnd that's all she did she wrote a couple of books was called breakthrough the creativity of but she was convinced totally convinced\nThat the ... the was the real deal and and again the psychiatrist seen that in so you're the only only other psychiatrist I Know that has really jumped into this\n[noise] although I'd like to look for that ... that sounds very interesting on\nBreak through to creativity I'm\nDefinitely gonna look for it but you know they're being on books\nWritten by physicians but near death experiences for example even Alexander the proof is having yeah and he's a neurosurgeon\nAnd marry the Neal she go to heaven and back she's in our therapeutic surgeon and of course Oliver Sacks he's in the garage test he wrote a book called hallucinations so physicians have written about these things that I haven't found another attack as to who's written about paranormal\nYeah you're going to enjoy them I mean she she just the the devoted her entire career to them so she uh she passed away and very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in a radio\nFilled in their home no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show or no you that's terrible ... how did you get interested in the last thing she just always\nWires and there were so many things that had happened to her and she just decided to do something to do this and she's going to study it and she she went into it in a big way\nWell that's good but I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor these medical center in New York where they were studying dream telepathy the ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming\nAnd in that study they had Sanders and receivers\nAnd the receivers were in a sleep lab\nAnd they were hooked up to an EEG to um the AG could measure what we call Graham sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the receivers wouldn't dream state the Centers for giving random images and they were told to concentrate on those images and try to send them to be the face and they found that people were more susceptible to ... to telepathy when they're asleep and it's also true that people are more\nSusceptible to telepathy when they're under hypnosis\nSo there are ways to augment leprosy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happened spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the more Dr many major is with us his book the borders of norm [noise]\nGo students ... the new version of the coast to coast am now available for I don't know Android for not only listen live on demand anywhere anytime\nNinety seven one coast to coast more stimulating on Sunday mornings at age more stimulating talk pastor Kim Masters just into in Ninety seven out of date or a mini\nMajors who are talking about his work the borders of normal a clinical psychiatrist de stigmatize as per normal phenomenon\nMany let's talk a little bit about the death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned over this so until you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice\nIs dying patients and they found\nA lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors and as they got closer to death is visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these visions weren't disturbing at all they were very comforting\n\n[noise] so yeah I think those those deathbed visions are very common now one interesting thing about death that visions is that sometimes there are shared by people at the bedside there was one case of a woman in India who is dying and\nShe says someone a deceased relative who came to take her to the other side and every three sisters who were at the bedside also saw the same person\nHe's not the not so unusual isn't it\nIt's unusual but there's been several cases like that three of in some cases where the medical personnel at the bedside saw the same vision that the dying patients saw\nAnd that's interesting because you know people who have deathbed vision the skeptics would say well that's because they're on medication or because they're confused or because they have a shortage of\nOxygen is the lack of oxygen to the brain they tried to give some kind of physical explanation for it but it's a vision or shared than those explanations wouldn't be valid because the people at the bedside wouldn't have a shortage of auction their brains\nAnd they weren't on medication so\nUm it's hard to know how to explain that and there again the people who have these decisions aren't necessarily relievers in the afterlife but these experiences are quite common\nWhen ... when Steve Jobs from apple computer died man he yeah he was quoted as saying\nOh wow oh wow now what do you think he's he was making reference to\n[noise] well I Know some people who\nAre dying tell their relatives they see a beautiful landscape a beautiful vision you know I'm a bright white light you know a spiritual beings you know I'm a feeling of unconditional love you know these are some of the things that I imagine that Steve Jobs was experiencing\nYeah that could be that could be no skeptics course say what the you mentioned that you\nKnow it's the body itself is doing all these weird things near the moment\nThe death how can we argue against that\nWell there was one study of um cardiac patients who had been assassinated after cardiac arrest\nAnd this study was done by a cardiologist and he said of of the the patients who who died in where we start to pay to Eighteen percent of them had a new report it in near death experience\nBut it's that experience is due to lack of oxygen to the brain than they would have all had it because they all have a lack of oxygen the brain not just a small percentage [noise]\nSo you know that's one thing but then the other thing is that um these experiences are reported around the world not just in the U.S there's a lot of cross cultural studies that show that these experiences are in many different countries and if he didn't report it throughout time\nAnd one study looked at patients who are on medication\nVersus patients or weren't on medication and the patients who weren't on medication who weren't confused and who didn't have a shortage boxed into the brain had the same experiences and were able to report them just as often as the other patients so [noise] um people are skeptical I think for a good reason and I think it's good to be skeptical\nBut it's also good to keep an open mind\nWell that's that's true in ... you you've talked about under deathbed visions that they sometimes see a little bit more than just a family member they see other kinds of visitors as well explain the\nWell the other visitors aside from family members they could be someone that they were very close to or sometimes they report angels coming to the others I'm coming to take them to the other side\nUm especially with children and there was a pediatrician mouth and Martha Stewart is dying children and he said the dying children didn't report deceased relative because their parents and their relatives and friends are all still living\nBut they've reported the angels that we're having to take them to the other side\nI had an experience at my father's funeral where I thought to angel is one of the other side of the coughing did anybody else you know so I could say I know they were a product of my own brain no one I saw them but in my own mind I saw those angels\nAnd they were just as clear as day standing right in front of me and I had the idea that thought came into my mind if they were called minutes during angels and they had the idea that they were minister and my father to help them make the transition it's the next level of the next world\nAnd they were the most beautiful creatures and I didn't know what to make that but that's really when I decided I Need to start telling people about what's going on because that was too much for me to keep to myself\n\nSee you I don't think so oh okay\nI don't think they were there for me I think there were there for my father right\nSo they didn't acknowledge you know you know you saw them\n... that's right now the other thing is when you say in terms of his deathbed visions you know um if they were produced by certain chemicals\nThan live with the um visitors only ... the people who are deceased why wouldn't they be other people as well\nThe other thing is sometimes these visions of deceased people there the person who's dying doesn't know that there may be a a brother or sister who had died is a case where there was a car crash and ... all one brother died and the other brother was near death\nSo the the brother that was near death had the vision of his dad brother but he hasn't been told that his brother had died in the same accidents you didn't know that there was the end\nAnd the rather cases like that to where the the deathbed visitors the person who is dying didn't know that that person was actually dead but because the family wanted to spare them the knowledge\nPre ... do the dreams give us your thoughts on what they are\nWell there again I've had the cognitive beams I mentioned one above the memory powerful above yeah exactly they're very powerful and the question is how do we know if it is a cognitive team or if it's an anxiety dream\nBecause often and you know when people are sleeping during the dreams they tried to protests things that happened during the day or things that they're worried about\nSo you know for example I talk about Abraham Lincoln two weeks before he was assassinated he he had a dream that he was murdered\nNow we could say that that was the peak cognitive dream that we could also say that could have been an anxiety dream maybe he was worried that someone was going to kill him [noise]\nMaybe I think you also had a dream where he was in the White House and he walked up to a soldier who is standing by ... and it was him in the ...\nI heard of that too yeah yeah so that could have been a ... another famous person who reported a ... interview with Charles Dickens\nReally I didn't hear that\nYeah 'cause when he was put out a new book he traveled around the small towns and villages and he'd give readings and so on so one night before he was to give a reading into a new town where he'd never been before he had a dream that\nI'm a group of people came up to them after his reading and a young woman in red shah introduced himself to her with four words she said I Am missed Napier\nSo when he woke up he thought that was very strange she didn't know anyone by that name but he remarked that the dream was very vivid and free cognitive teams tend to be very vivid\nI'm often when we wake up in the morning I beams start to fade the pre cognitive dreams stay with us and we remember every detail so the next day he went to give his reading\nAnd sure enough after the meeting a group of people came up to him and there was a young woman wearing a red Shaw and she was introduced to him as misnamed here [noise] so so this stream was a pretty cognitive dream and he didn't know what to think of it or\nOr how to explain it but he he reported he had that the cognitive dream so I'm ... some people for example Larry ... a person has written about\nYes ... cognitive beans and he's written a boat when should we pay attention to a dream how do we know if it's peak cognitive femur not and he said we should pay attention to dreams first of all agreements week current or if it's especially vivid or if it involves death\nFor more information on adoptions dumped us gives don't work a message from the U.S department of health and Human Services or don't you ask you to the council [noise]\n\n\n\n\nEasy

the night that she died I was sitting on the couch with bad weather we're having storm and I was doing laundry can sleep and I just knew something was wrong and then when I saw everything happening on the TV screen it just was like so surreal it was just\nThat was the first time I've ever had anything like that ever happened to me um I don't know if anyone else we've never had that kind of I mean it sounds like what you're talking about two and then for my son died\nI had the same thing I had the vision of ... a dream for like two weeks and just couldn't sleep and uneasy feeling in two cops coming to his dad's door so horrible\nAnd I didn't know what to think of it and it was just I've never had anything else like that happen [noise] um [noise] so um I I'm familiar you know I'm I've heard you know I just\nI don't know I I it only happens in hook people to me when\nIf they're going to die I kinda know I you know I kind of know things like\nYou do you tell them\nWell I'm now I Know I don't know who's going to die I just get\nReally you're just not somebody's going to die\nI just get um I get very I start crying crying you know I get very emotional and very sensitive and just crying and upset but not sure why\nMany what causes of fish don't want to say I'm Sorry to hear about your son\nAnd I was wondering um if you had any post death contact with him\nNow anyway I Would say no I have not any contact with him since he died now I have not and several people my daughters and several other friend path but now I have not in that very troubling\nOkay well in terms of your question uh George what causes that liget\nDream or premonition you know ...\nAnd I think it's related to the well on a theoretical level you could say on one level we're all connected\nAnd somehow are able to communicate with each other in a way that we're not really aware of you know I'm I think that especially someone very close like a family member especially you know a child or sibling or parent or a spouse\nIf you want to communicate with the deceased loved one is it easier to be a little more aggressive to try to communicate with them or do you laid back and let them try to come to you\nI Would say that the latter I Would let them come to you know because they may not be ready\nYou have to give them any signs that you're already\nWell you have to I think you have to say that you open the experience and that you would love to hear from them and then the ball is in their court\nWas going to Virginia Keats with us welcome to the program Keith\n[noise] hey George how are you hey there good can you hear me okay yeah pretty good\nOkay great I'm willing to let you a couple of things one last night with your guest I call them but a too late to get on and uh it there are some commonality and some of the topics tonight about um the paranormal and\nAh you know something I consider to be quite a link between paranormal and the a Judeo Christian teachers in the Bible a link could be\nA the content of a book called eternal man and anybody can go about are searching on YouTube or Amazon you\nCan find different lectures and things about that and over the years time it is a book written by a B. Y. U. religion of ... professor and over the years I just listening\nTo coast to coast it's just been quite remarkable that\nThere there is much of the paranormal uh that that can be clarified and expanded upon perhaps to give some other Sandy after of of the eternal nature and our spiritual nature as well and\nUm to switch to another topic really quick or a ... years ago I had a dream and it could've been induced by\nA listener on the coast to coast a lot about a year ago experience for them to friends who passed away only about I think Thirteen Days apart from each other about twenty

your consideration about the possibility of\nA the certainty of Dr Christine Blasey Ford about the events that she said happened to her\nBut yet all the people that she mentioned not a single one of them even if you think about that and uh the dream that I had was that um that was my my brother's apartment where the second round little house he passed away playing basketball one night with my brother\nAnd a party at the end of this time the dream to my brother and me all the later and he looks at me and he says and I'll see you and Thirteen months and I knew he was dead\nOh ... ... there's

putting in the book together was\nThere are some part of it are just overwhelmed you that you did not expect that you came across when you were researching it and put it together\nI think the most interesting thing with the deathbed vision you know because I left that thing that I didn't realize how common that was no we've we've certainly heard a lot of a near death experience and visions and out of body experience is associated with near death experience\nBut I wasn't really ... with a deathbed visions or the visions of deceased loved ones that are also very common\nThe deathbed visions do you think it's the body's way of making death a little more comfortable for people or is it something other strictly outside of the physical brain\nI think it's both I think it's a combination because I like to look at it from the point of view of the body plus the mind plus the emotional life plus the spiritual life so I think that for different components in each one is important\nWhat has been for you the most dramatic case you've come across\n... that's a good question because there's so many of them\nI mean the cases have example people who've had the cognitive dreams that have helped him win the lottery\nWow you know I'm I don't get those kind of dreams\nNo me neither but that's been verified [noise] you know I wanted to say one comment about your previous caller sure when he was talking about the connection between paranormal experience and the Judeo Christian tradition Mm mhm\n[noise] if you look at the Bible they certainly lots of it will cook profits like Daniel and as the keel or if example Joseph you know who had the cognitive genes are prophetic beams you might say and even in the history of the church people like St Francis ... the the Joan of arc they heard voices\nYou know when when John was Thirteen Years old she said she saw lining light light and you heard of voice which he identified as the arcane something Michael coming from her father's garden so these experiences have been documented by many people\nThroughout the Bible and throughout the history of the church so I think there is a connection\nYeah they're most definitely is just remarkable how this works ... it's it's you know let's call it the gods factor or whatever it might be but it's out there it's real yeah the big question is why should the were the first place what do you think\n[noise] [noise] [noise] ... the first thing that came through my mind if it's out there to make our lives more meaningful\nIt gives us a different level or a different dimension to our lives and that somehow if that's something to feel like what we're going to even if it's a painful experience can have some meaning it can have\nSome value absolutely okay let's take some phone calls here for you we will be given by going to Joe in Long Island New York hey Joseph go ahead\nYeah Hi Maddie I Want to ask you a little bit more about the dreams\nAre interestingly I had to drains recently that began with a preference of the day it said of October first and I ended up at the beach I go on the water for a little rough with this other people's swamp thing and it's um usually warm which would be the case had I Want\nBut I never really had a dream where it started off given the ... the day which was the same date\nIn real life\nSo my question would be with your dream about the past\nThe next day which was you know you had the first question it's it's almost like the dream was a personal coach for you [noise]\nAh so I ask you about that you know what you think and the case that train for going to a really acting in your favor number one and then if the dream is\nNot quite calling and what and you're thinking that the aspects that are still really current and have current applications that you could cherry pick and how would you do that\nWell first of all your first question how do you know if the demons acting in your favor or I'd say is is the content of the dream of warning you know is it something that can be helpful for you and your daily life is telling you about something that's\nComing up for you and your life or is it about another person so I'd say it's acting in your favor first of all if it's about you not about another person\nAnd if it's and they the accidents than official\nNow in terms of Kenya cherry pick I Would say yes because\nIt can be some super fluid author extraneous materials energy and that's not necessarily related the main point and fixing so I think to a certain extent you have to take out those parts of the dream which you feel applied you and which can be helpful for you and your daily life\nSo now you ... yeah that's that was good yeah\nOkay very good next up we're going to marry in Seattle, Washington west

Hillary\nHillary ... block\nSo now are there going on eight speaking to her they'll make a lot of money I think it's Nineteen stops if I'm not mistaken starting next week or two at Christmas Time and they're going to ah talk about the birds and the bees the flowers and the trees the moon up above and the thing called love\nOr maybe not but they'll have good stories I don't think there's a more popular person\nIn terms of just attracting a crowd in this country no matter what the genre that Bill Clinton he attract people love they with the same degree of animals they dislike Hillary or at least some people do but uh yeah there are people who just like robot there's something about it\nThey just very enjoyable is dirty I Know what they're it's it's true in\nFriends of mine ... never forget this my mom and I belong to the to 'em and historical preservation group\nAnd so with lots of little old ladies and on and they're very very Republican and I remember years ago when I was a kid they had met somehow they met Bill Clinton and ... both these two little Biddy they said you know we're you know we we didn't vote for him we never would but you know what when when we met him we kinda got it\nLike like they had like they figured out some great they said that they like really like when you meet him in person he's got this magnanimous kind of aura about him and they said that they they definitely were swooning over a bit\nUntil your question him about the sexual assault stuff the poet cab and all\nThat well I don't know not everybody all that kind of a story this week is that\nYou know they're going out on this tour and bill really should be just kind of laying low right now waiting for all this to blow over before he comes back out because\nI Know unfortunately this has been planned for a while right now Hillary has to answer to her covering up for Bill and calling these women grounds you\nCan be sure any questions from the audience you're going to be well screened or yeah had dug they're going to be having oh hey Fred back in the third row bleeds right they ask you a little\nBit on ah some news channel the other day and he got a little testy with them\nYeah well the he pushed on Monica Lewinsky recently right and so I I think that's where he said look you know either ... yeah because of the me too movement on she's now Monica Lewinsky has labeled herself as an activist\nOn so she's kind of been a little more visible recently but you know look if they're going to go out and be on tour together\nI don't think it would be Hillary's and though to back away from those questions maybe bill doesn't want to answer them but I think Hillary would I really do\nMm well it'd be interesting what you're going to say power covered what are they saying\nWhat well I don't know what her and walk into any way to either one of ... and all the rest of them Jennifer Flowers flu is ... ... what's your response to the gym sector and re question then let her answer it or that\nI mean her husband was a serial cheater I don't know if he was you know we don't know if he was a sexual Salter like the way that you know Brett Kavanaugh was accused of oil and and the bill Cosby type stuff\nI don't know if he did she marry a deadbeat husband absolutely but you know that's her choice to stick with him so\nA deadbeat has been in what way well\nHe's a he's a serial cheater to me that equals a day that's all you have ... evidence or really for me personally I started a deadbeat husband would be sort of didn't pay his alimony there like a ... a deadly you could ask so\nTrends parents it's just I get them to\nA way to make more money but you know what those any different Ronnie ended on a million dollars by ... how how is it any different it's not right so some people choose to stay in in marriages it would not it would never be from and that's not for me I wouldn't want it\nI think Donald certainly is attracted to and love having a lot of us as white whether it was er I don't know in ... he was there for convenience and write me she loves him too I don't know maybe she does\nSo maybe the Clintons have some sort of other love for each other

I Know because of what I looked into when I was trying to find ways to support my sister and my ex wife in their fight and Susan G Komen Foundation itself\nA was named for a lady who suffered long and and the way her sister has run that thing is just a damned outrage so and now she's up for the job you're an ambassador\nThumbs down baby on her for any number of his name\nWas Laura there I just want to correct the ice and ...

Nancy Brinker has already been confirmed because she was in um\nIn fact it was ... or how to Hungary under George W so I think she already went through the Senate confirmation so I think that might be part of the reason a she's a woman and I think it might be part of the reason why she she would pretty much sail through a Senate confirmation\nI'm guessing that ah that she will not do the kind of work that Nikki Haley is done\nThey're going to be able to get a job to do that over there and but you know she's ... like you said is that a toughie years\nWell but they are and the headline was all about our finances yeah so she had the same financial difficulty a lot of his head why are we focusing on that\nScale because she also mentioned that too that she wanted to get back into the private

about this guy this Saudi citizens\nBeen disappeared I'm always I'm always amazed how the media just all the stops doing any kind of journalism like like I see the stories are writing and I'm like this is not what I Would be writing about at all\nFor one yes this is like a ... style movie somebody's it really is yeah I absolutely think the Saudis are guilty on this I think turkey is probably over playing what they do have probably just a little bit in the ...\nBut um but everyone's framing this this this uh this journalist ... as this great guy Nobel Prize winning oh yeah he's got to be he'll be a Nobel Peace prize winner soon he came out so surprise surprise he really came to prominence in the media loved him the west loved him during the Obama administration\nOr why was that because well he was one of these one's advocating for democracy and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other places when the Arab Spring was breaking ... now that lines of exactly what the Obama administration was wanting to do and also who are they in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood and places like Egypt will surprise surprise because shockey is Muslim Brotherhood\nHe's actually that's the reason why he's not in the people in the media have said oh well he spoke out against you know the uh the kingdom the Saudi kingdom and that's probably why they don't like I Know kitten but it goes way beyond that like he they support a political Islam group\nThat wants to overthrow the monarchy it's a lot goes a lot further than I spoke out against them yeah he is the public in public enemy number one but he's right up in that group with them\nUm and then he was friends with the crown prince thought what do you not um I don't know how they're framing\nIt he was friends he was he was he love the crowd ... they got along and and he said a lot of great things about the crown prince now he disagrees with some of the crown princes policies\nAnd that's where they've wife wants to take the Saudi out of Saudi Arabia basically that's the best way to put it for this guy but he's a he's not a good guy\nHe wants to political Islam he wants to political Islam to invade countries all over the world and take it over and he was living here for quite a while before he went to work in Washington Post yeah no no issues there whatsoever\nI'm I'm On the other hand you have this one guy that's not that great of a guy on the other hand you have a mom and been some in the crown prince who ever want to send this is this great reformer he he he's a great guy is a great leader is going to modernize Saudi Arabia women can drive now all these social is all these tackling\nHe they dug plain and simple he is eight Doug they go after he's doing this to tons and tons of people thousands of people in his own country people just disappear they go to jail for the rest of their life he has a thug and the only reason he's tackling social issues is because they have a lot of young people in Saudi Arabia\nAnd social unrest is about to hit the street if you want to see the place where the next ah Arab Spring might happen Saudi Arabia\nThe the demographics point to it I Would not be surprised right all so how do you keep Saudi Arabia under control do without a thug\nYou can't I mean it's like Russia really either right groups like other countries like that you really can't here's a disturbing part ... ... ... most likely most likely this guy was killed by Saudi Arabia yeah um it just it just feels like a man and then maybe all of a sudden he pops up and I'm like\nNo I was a chick fillet and nobody in the news media wants to look at it that way so I was invisible\nFor a while maybe doubtful here's the problem we are ... we are pushing through a major arms deal\nWith Saudi Arabia we should not be doing that now we should not be doing that that should it be canceled today I can tell you however what is being what is happening is\nYou know the United states was supporting the Muslim Brotherhood now we have some people who know exactly what's going on in that part of the world and there are probably being talked to by Saudi Arabia going look look guys guys\nYeah I Know you don't like what we're doing here but uh it's the Muslim Brotherhood and its a caliphate you what you want the whole region to be in the Muslim Brotherhood caliphate have at it yeah and that's the

it's so frightening because you know kids\nWhen they go into their teenage years their bodies are changing and everything else and they you know they start not listening to mom and dad and ... out of all the usual\nStuff okay but now it's like you know ... ... you would lose them overnight and I need to lose them with depression rates the way they're going with all of this influence that they can get I'm just so freaked\nOut all the time and I can't believe that I'm Alone oh you ... I'm sure you're not alone and like I Would you know basically the perfect child as my mom would Fouche uh for for\nMy mother had died she would say the same I figure I'm sure I'm\nYou know but it's it's ... you're right it gets dark fats I think the stuffing swirl out of control really fast with with social media and stuff or you know I I don't know how\nI don't know how to even contemplate dealing with that but yeah I mean I you know your your kids seem like they're pretty pretty good shape I mean they want you to believe upstanding young people\nHaven't you know that I mean my son is now going he's got testosterone you know pumping through his body and you know I just it's it's frightening I guess because I remember what I was like I remember how I felt ally was moody and everything else and\nAnd now [noise] you know what's\nReal what's not what's it's just so hard and I you know I said to my son I said to my son last night we were having a conversation and I said\nSo what are\nWhat are the two words because he was talking himself down and I said\nStop stop listen to yourself\nAnd he said what and I said listen to what you're creating listen to what you're saying and I gave him the dad I Am speech that I've said how many times have you here at one more time my gosh you're going to kill yourself yeah hundred times on the air you know that that I started in this and I said you know this and he said\nI don't I said I I've ...\nOh my gosh am I not told you this you haven't told your own kids but you're told the national radio over and over and over again and I realize that\nThere are some things that we just think our kids here and\nBecause there are around us they just know they're going to pick up I mean he's in American history right now and you know she probably knows more than some kids are most kids on a lot of things but things are big gaping holes and I realized\nHow much of my time with my son do I think he gets it through us most is somehow or another you know\nJust because he's living here and blah blah blah and he hears me give speeches and here's me on the radio and here's a blah blah blah\nHe's\nThere we it's maybe it's just me I don't know if if I'm just going through this but my gosh you have to be very very specific and watch what you're saying to your kids\nAnd and be with them all the time and what's frightening is the influence is so strong and so sexy on the outside that it's the draw that they're just ... you're just black and white that everything else is color\nYeah yeah I ... a ... I mean one suggestion is a he was the Jodie Foster movie panic room and she what she did is she was able to lock herself in the room and have no outside influences at all\nAnd I think that goes into it or I ...

he always wants to be and do the right thing and won't be concerned about reelection this is just a political move in a political statement\nAnd um I I mean it doesn't get any more sick than this\nNow thank goodness our friends over at project Vera toss wherever the catch all these people including top campaign workers were Bredesen exposing what was the truth was their undercover cameras you know you know based it's all exposed they're ready to stab saying that Brett it sends a liar\nWhen he said he would vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh it is purely a blatant political move\nAnd uh when I asked for comment all they said was well project meritocracy posed as fake volunteer and and you secret video recording equipment to capture uninformed is speculative comments made last weekend by

said I Would be voting was a big deal and they're all saying\nThat no it was a big lie it was a cheap political move to get rural voters that weren't supporting him in Tennessee I mean I took it\nAnd that that isn't but that isn't your a statement now that this tape and coming from their own mouth and Sean I don't\nI'm not speculating here I'm not reporting this anonymously you can actually see the sitting in the coming out of their own mouth they're the ones who are selling it so we are confirming the suspicions what you just said we've confirmed that\nAnd again it's not just one or two or three and half a dozen of these people are inside the campaign office they have confirmed that the people are real\nAnd and then of course you have the the oldest material what the president staffer thinks the Tennessee voters are ignorant\nHe says quote we don't say this out of these walls\nHe says will be a good Democrat and what that means he'll be a good Democrat that means that he's going to vote with the Schumer wing of the party once she gets elected kind of see they don't want them even the Democrats don't want them to be Chuck Schumer democratic so all of this is pretty amazing stuff Sean and uh\nYou know it's it's just we're confirming what was known for years\nYou know you you think back and you you think Peter Struck and he talked about smelly Wal Mart Trump voters and you

poll how'd you within five\nAh thanks for having me on a Sean and you're right I was listening to your earlier remarks about the Florida and everything and uh you said help is on the way that's actually our message to the people of California that\nGavin Newsom political class has resulted in the highest housing prices the highest gas prices water is being rationed in California you're right he's proposing new open\nAll the way they should rationing the water because of the delta smelled so I went out there in Denver newness his district is a great guy and if you're in the in the San Joaquin Valley I was out and I did a show from there a couple of years ago when the farmers to couldn't farm because they were saving water for this little itsy bitsy fish called the delta smelt\nWell that's part of it Shawn but they haven't built a reservoir out here in Thirty years imagine\nCalifornia if it hadn't built a road in the last Thirty years can you imagine what the congestion would be like it's it's all horrible anyway and but they haven't built a reservoir and we'd go one desalination plant that\nTruck Twenty years because a lawsuit and regulations and you know we've got to do more just sell nation we got to do more recycling we got a Bill Maher reservoirs that's all the rest Jordan but the political class you're right they don't want to do that they want to save well little tiny fish which is wonderful but we got to live\nWell farmers got a farm and that is such a big part of the California condor mayhem and you're growing oranges and avocados and and all sorts of other you know strawberries and\nAnd fruits and vegetables you may not know this about me but I Lived in Santa Barbara five years of my life when I was broken and have you on what I was a porous guy in Santa Barbara at the time but\nUh I Love the weather out there and when I had my first orange picked up a tree which I stole a it was like a I think I've ever had in my life um let me ask you this so you have Thirteen and a half percent state income tax rate out there you're sanctuary state not a city whole state\nAnd now the avenue someone's free health care for everybody's busy putting up a sign that says if you get sick come here\nYeah I saw that the Newt and said that all the other governors around the country are probably vote for a new so so they can send anybody who is ill to California\nAnd our taxpayers will pay a their health care you know that's ridiculous shot I mean even per month that they didn't want single payer health care but you know news is basically just\nOffer anything free to anybody and then the process what he's doing is he's going to make California even more on affordable than it already is a\nI the people know that this guy mismanaged San Francisco you didn't fix the homeless problem there he's personally compromised jeez are\nPretty much empty suit was put in business by a billionaire or get a family and I think people want somebody like myself I struggled I built a small business I've got results in the private sector a and I think that's what people are looking for\nHow come the people of California then maybe I should ask the same question of myself because we're not far behind you in New York state was nine point nine percent hide the highest income tax rate why did the people of California takeoff Thirteen and a half percent\nIncome state income tax rate and and there's no rebellion out there why are they taking that crap\nIt's beyond me and a lot of people are leaving Sean as you might know California's had an exodus of people\nTo ask ... New York New Jersey in Illinois when everybody saying in Texas and Florida and then the Carolinas you can come but if you're going to bring your dopey dumb liberal policies with you know stay home [laughter]\nI don't blame them I talk to Greg Abbott about that you said they are they're they're they're ruining the politics of that state although I think they'll still survive lets it we've got to make sure that California is affordable that it's\nOpen for business Sean our education system is now buying with Mississippi for one of the worst educational results in the\n... best ... you'll be the best you know\nYeah look I don't know what the I don't know what your odds are I Will say this I I really hope\nThat the people of California pay attention because you know putting a businessman in their California is one of the most beautiful states in the union and it's been literally being destroyed from within by politicians\nFrom the Ninety seven point one the big talker weather center and always online ad big talk radio dot com I'm chief meteorologist Kevin Williams\nIn Oak Creek some ...

everyone hope you all have any grace friday we've got a lot of interviews lined up for you today talking about a lot of issues a lot of propositions\nOr election time most of your receiving your early ballots so we're going to go over tons of stuff because today I'm actually touring the Palo Verde nuclear power plant I'll tell you all about it Monday starting at three PM\nAnyway here's an issue that I don't think a lot of folks really heard about or paid attention to and it's the selection of judge it I'm not talking about cabinet here I'm Talking about in Arizona\nAnd how judges superior court judges are are put into that position is Jerry neighbors talking about proposition for sixteen [noise]\n\n\nAlways looks cheering interest is with me I'm Jerry I'm obviously was mayor of Flagstaff also an attorney hum and you've dealt with judges obviously for for your career for for many many decades what I've found kind of weird\nAnd all these years is electing judges and especially it's not even like the city council races where it's non partisan a meaning you know there's not a deer in our on the ballot or whatever um the judge races in at least Coconino county are partisan their political races correct\nYeah and and Jeff we are talking about this the carrier court judges are not justice of the peace will not talking about that at all but the superior court judges of what which we have five in Coconino county\nThey are right now they are elected and as you say they are elected in a part of some process they are either Democrats or Republicans and they go through a Democrat or Republican primary\nAnd with they are on the ballot in the general election there's no designation of the or are but they had to go through a partisan primaries to get there\nOh so you're saying on the general there's no person indication but the primary he run as a Democrat obviously that you're pulling the you're getting a Democrat ballot you're voting on it now I Will say this is Jerry\nI have not noticed many Republicans or anything else running for um judge in Coconino county it's mostly Democrat and the other side don't oppose almost it seems like almost every election\nIt is it's very weird Jeff because you're right a lot of times it will be two Democrats running against each other\nOccasionally it as a Democrat and Republican that run against each other and a lot of times the judges run unopposed\nIt is the case they're very definitely the case and we know that we have to select a mixture of parties that than names to the governor can all the of one party and\nAnd and on this committee we've got Democrats and Republicans and independents like me and um and I can tell you Jeff we set that aside\nYou know there will be a motion to you know I recommend this person and that will you is that is a real top notch candidate that will usually get you know numerous vote yes for them that named to the governor regardless of party\nAnd then Jeff I have to mention this\nThere are a lot of good\nJudges potential judges in Coconino county who would never run for election ... they would have they would be happy to a wider they're good attorneys their top notch attorneys they would love to be a judge\nThey would be more than willing to apply and be interviewed to be a judge\nBut they are not going to run for election\nDon't want to go through the process and\nIt yeah exactly you know get all of the nomination petition signatures and you know ask people for donations than put out your signs than you do all the advertising that they're very on becoming for a judge\nTo have to do all of that and a lot of people are not willing to do that they just go no if that's what I have to do I'm not going to do it but if there was an opening I Would be more than willing to apply\nAll right then and so that the best thing about this merits selection process as it gets the best quality candidate and it gets prop not judges with out getting end of the partisan election process\nI it's just a real good way I've seen it first hand of course I've seen it in Coconino county uh you know forty years as a as an attorney in Coconino county I've been involved in judicial elections are then judicial elections and that no way to pick a judge\nAnd I've seen the select the merits selection process that's the way to do it that's the way the the country is moving and I think it would be great Coconino county to be on the cutting\nYou've been hearing a lot about prop one twenty seven independent studies show prop\nOne twenty seven will cost the

actually came in from Pam again one more time trying to send an email talk with Jeff iCloud dot com [noise] uh I've been listening to talk talking about all the initiatives on the ballot is there any way you can post on your website how you would vote\nOn them I'm Pam thank you for that email I'm\nAlmost there Pam I Do have ads to talk\nWith Jeff dot coms to go to talk with Jeff dot com top right corners in elections tab and I have a bunch of interviews there we've done with candidates and a bunch of interviews we've done on on some of the issues\nAre Pam I'm Still deciding on a couple of initiatives actually now some in what I'll do Pam is I Will get those I'm gonna try by the end of the week to get my recommendations up but but like I said earlier in the show\nI recommend that you hold your ballot for a little while um if you lose it you can even go request a new one I Believe I'll Try to get the um I Need to get some county recorders on the air this week let's let's try to do that\nUm but I recommend you hold those valves because you never know a bomb shelter gonna come up plus we still have candidates coming on for ... for example if you're in Flagstaff area I haven't even had on all the city council candidates there are six\nI've invited all six of four have been on the east a fifth one is coming on this uh Thursday and that's Paul easy\nI'm trying to get the six but quite frankly uh the sixth person has not responded I Want to try to get the write in candidate Georgia mellow and again and I'll I'll throw out one more invite to the mayor of Flagstaff coral Evans and I'll hold my breath for that one\nBut I haven't even had everyone in yet so I recommend holding them but what I'll do is I'll give you my recommendations especially on a lot of these um propositions and one of them I honestly\nThat I'm undecided on and this would be a Coconino county issue and that's where the community college now typically I Am a no\nTypically I Am a no on most bond initiatives that because there is people's property taxes however\nI'm not telling you which way I'm going yet because I'm undecided I'm I'm going to reach out to them maybe go to a tour of the community college and find out what they intend to use the the additional funds for she's been on the show US President Colleen Smith of Coconino community college you can get that interview at talk with Jeff dot com\nBut I Want to go see it for my own eyes before I give a recommendation if I give her recommendation and I probably will\nAnd this one is piqued my interest in this proposition in the uh Coconino county areas proposition\nSeventeen and and it's a bonding issue taxing issue because I'm\nI'm looking at all these costs to go to a university such as northern Arizona university\nI'm looking at the effect that northern Arizona university\nAh is having a on the community and there's a lot of good\nBut there's also a lot of negative and we've been talking a lot recently about the huge land purchases trolling what Thirteen million dollars right on the main court or Flagstaff Milton avenue we're looking at college debt how much students are coming out of school so I look at the community college um and say hey search is there a better way\nAnd she explained it real good when she was on the show and there must be a better way cheaper way for these kids to get out of school and I I I keep saying kids but these are adults to go to these two that are looking for a career change they're looking for technical training so anyway I'm back to this email Pam I'm Still deciding I'm like you\nIt's just I I get the vet some of these things on there and you get to hear my my brain working out loud and um I Will decide soon but for Seventeen I I'm On the fence on but there's a couple of others fan then I'll tell you right now proposition for twenty two if you're in Flagstaff area\nAlso known as the Robin Hood tax as named by former flex of marriage frequent contributor on the show Jerry neighbors um would would tax your property now that's another bond issue\nThat's a bar on your shoe the city wants to issue up to twenty five million dollars in debt and then attach that to your property taxes which by the way you've gotten your tax bills right it's gone up tremendously because the economy's doing better housing prices have gone up but can you imagine how much is going to go up if all these bond initiatives do pass\nThat's why a lot of people are saying I'm voting on everything because it will raise your property taxes despite what some people say\nThe proposition for twenty two would require twenty five million dollars in additional debt that you're responsible to pay back through your property taxes and then it'll set up some vague committee\nSome vague committee decide who gets home and who doesn't or who gets down payment assistance or it's so big I don't even know what it is and the opposition on this has been pretty steep I've seen opposition on the right and on the less\nSo uh I Will tell you now proposition for twenty two I Am an absolute outer no on\nAnother one in Flagstaff and I'm going to move on to a couple of state wide ... and we'll cover these all week and and the coming weeks until the election which is what a month away now but you get in your early ballots your towards the end of the week\nProposition for Eighteen in Flagstaff which has become a heated mess once again with national tie ins I saw an article in the Flagstaff fire in ... local paper this weekend about the out of state money which we've been talking about forever\nBut are they particularly focused on the yes on for Eighteen money and this one's a little confusing this is the minimum wage that's going to Fifteen fifty per hour in Flagstaff\nAnd if you don't pass prop for Eighteen is going to go to Fifteen fifty you're gonna have one of the highest minimum wages in the nation right in Arizona hired in New York hired and San Francisco and profit for Eighteen would slow that down to about twelve fifty\nPer hour and then have inflationary measures built in as part of the state law okay so huge huge increase\nAnd there was this article that basically said hey out of state or dark money's coming in from the U.S on fourteen folks\nAnd the person uh we've had Blake over on he's the manager of the proposition said hey folks didn't want they want to remain anonymous and I know is of some of this money's coming from I've talked to them folks I'm not going to say who they are but all I can tell you a lot of this money most of this money's coming from locally\nAnd they're worried about retribution they're worried about people picketing and protesting their businesses now you know describe would never do that I mean they wouldn't try to claw their way into the Supreme Court or anything so these these folks are concerned about retribution on their businesses if they support or trying to cap off the minimum wage\nBut the no on fourteen people to fly seventies race group they've gotten their money from out of state from New York's from New York City from unions down in Phoenix so\nI don't know folks for Eighteen I Am a yes on for Eighteen to try to slow down this massive wage increase now one more I didn't want to cover today um and by the way I'll Try to get 'em I Want to get ... it looks as trying to get him on today but it looks like it'll be tomorrow\nAnd we're talking about the selection of judges in Coconino county most of the state\nDoes judges on a merit based system oh no here we go I'm Kevin Cavanaugh flashbacks a merit based system that the governor appoints them and then you vote later on to retain them so do you want to keep 'em or not\nCooking you know Canada's not to do a popular election to select judges are so we're going to talk with Jerry neighbors um it's not prop one twenty five it's it's something else will get it from Jerry when it comes on\nBut that proposition would have a merit based judge selection or for your superior court judges\nOne other one that you know\nI'm supporting is proposition one twenty six this is the ban on sales tax on services this one is shocked me though and there's plenty of interviews up at talk with Jeff dot com if you click on that top right tab\nOr talk with Jeff dot com click on elections I've had on proponents of one twenty six such as Holly Mayberry realtor out of the very value in Prescott area who helped get this on the ballot um I've had proponents on like Senator Sylvie Alan ... and many others but I've also had folks\nThat surprised me um who say they are opposed to proposition one twenty six\nPeople like me who I'm friends with who I agree with on a lot of stances Americans for prosperity there Arizona director said hey we're against this governor do she's against us so I'm In an interesting position because I I'm looking at a lot of my friends on the right saying what do you what are you talking about prop one twenty six would ban\nMake a constitutional amendment to ban sales tax on services the argument is we want to keep that option open and a lot of these arguments are coming from politicians who want to keep that are uh that option open to tax\nServices so that maybe maybe they can and income tax but I say and I've said this all along I think that's a pipe dream so until you show me that you have a solid plan to to get rid of income taxes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "12"}
