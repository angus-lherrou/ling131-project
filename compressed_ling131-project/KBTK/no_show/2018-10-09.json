baby step three B what that means is that they are debt free except their home they've saved up their emergency fund a three to six months of expenses and three beam means beyond that they're saving for the down payment on our house\nWe want to take her two young children to Disney World you should\nWe're currently saving to build her on a new home on property we bought in cash already we can cash flow the tree up by not saving for the house for one month about three thousand dollars I feel guilty for both not taking a family vacation and for not saving money where's the balance you you're guilty a lot aren't you\nI mean you're stuck 'cause you're just going to be guilty you're guilty if you go to Disney and you're going to be guilty if you don't\nYou know what I Do I'd be happy if I did either one not gonna be guilty either way it's your money it's your choice you're smart either way you're out of debt you have your emergency fund and you're saving up for expenditures\nOne of the expenditures as you want to build a house for cash that some awesome go second one is you want to spend more months of that money and go to Disney about three thousand bucks a either one is wonderful you should not feel guilty\nEither way but I'll tell you what I Would do I'd go to Disney yeah little kids you part is perfect age for that\nUm if he is something you obviously do want to do something they want to do I'm just not something I Want to do but you it's fine I mean Rachel cruise loves Disney she just took her little baby down there I had a wonderful time not sure how ready time her husband had but they had a great time and I'm\nNow ... but but I mean if it's what you want to do\nYou've saved up the money you're not going into that you're not getting out of debt and going on vacation you're out of that\nYou have your emergency fund this is the point in the baby steps where you enjoy some of the money and I don't suggest consuming all of it and hitting no long term goals but I think if you don't consume some of it and only hit long term goals then you're not enjoying your life\nYou live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else during the first three baby steps you're extremely intense you don't do anything except beans and rice rice and beans till you're out of debt and have your emergency fund in place then you let your foot off the accelerator some to where you can do baby steps for five and six\nAnd purchases are in there all at the same time maybe step for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement meanwhile you start putting some for your kid's college and five and six is when you find extra money pay off the house certainly in that sense that what you're working towards the middle of all of that we don't go ten years and never go on vacation\nThat's when you go on vacation we don't go ten years and never upgrade the couch that as springs sticking out of it that's when you upgrade the couch you just pay cash for this stuff and you realize that every time we consume something it slows down our long term wealth building but the purpose of long term wealth building has to be able to consume\nAnd to be able to give money\nPiled up just for pollen ... having power money sake is not worth anything is only worth something when it does something for your family or you're able to do something for others that's all it's good for Jay is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Jay welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave out ... thank you for taking my call first time caller sure I'm about two years ago I began a commercial helicopter training\nAnd I finally received like commercial helicopter state ticket\nUm however I unfortunately I Need a the by eighty hours or more training I discovered this I mean there's trees highly regulated by insurance\nAnd in order to become a share of NATO out two hundred hours and I'm trying to figure out how to pay for eighty hours and be ready to work for the upcoming season I'm as a commercial pilot up about\n... is there any way you can do it as a co pilot and get the hours\n[noise] no I unfortunately uh they uh a job I have is the single pilot\nNow that that moment you just said the wrong thing you should do the job opportunity there's only one person in Florida and you know like ... what's wrong\nWell uh uh I I didn't tell you another thing or two days I I work at a firefighter so that's my primary um income choice there's this kind of like a secondary thing that I kinda went off in bed and that's a\nThat's kind of why I'm I'm kinda limited as far as ah the jobs that I I can take\nThe helicopter pilots not make more than firefighters and yell\nI Believe it or not firefighters are definitely make are\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or a career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter pilot\nYes yeah so that's what I Want to do [noise] okay\nUm and you show U.S forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work in a regular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited value\nYeah it's not that body parts like it's not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this is like a like a hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I just I feel I'm I'm too far into it they just\nI'm not suggesting you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except just slow down and go I'm just gonna take me a little time because I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do their hours\nRight they say don't rush to get the job done up to it and it was a child is not worth that much yeah it doesn't pay that much either\nThat's what I mean they're not worth that last compared to what you're paying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training and the first year\nNo mayor right now\nSo not to mention all the money you've already put on it so um what I Want to do is look for a place I mean you've got connections in the fire department or other lifelike guys or something that you can get some hours and the co pilot's seat and get some takeoffs and landings and get some of the council actually\nA fork saying those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently find a Robin ...\nAnd both have to craft gotcha not even a\nTurbine yet but um I mean I've even reached out to people that are on their on an aircraft and and you know offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get does a ... man out for a chill out a lot of those guys are very busy\nSo yeah I can get and our air and our there but nothing really counts as\nTo who you're going to end up paying for these hours what does it the eighty hours cost\n[noise] well considering some of the hour and a choice of a you know on the cheap you can get some at two fifty a three hundred five hundred it all depends on the aircraft and all that kind of a deal you can get you know so\nThat she won a thirty thousand bucks yeah pretty much already my chair and you don't have that laying around obviously negative negative on\nJust take your time and cash flow it because you you now have as we continue the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level ... ... the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more\nAnd so this is slightly above a hobby\nYeah yeah definitely it's a ... ... yeah I went out and out there\nYeah yeah and I I've got a I I collect handguns and shoot them a lot\nAnd uh and and also I burn through some ammo it's but it's a power don't make any money doing I'm not trying to make money doing it but I was just a hobby\nAnd so that costs money hobbies costs are on and this was not going to cost you money is actually going to make you a little once you get past this but up until the point you actually get a check it's gonna cost you money and you know you're just going to put another twenty thousand bucks into this thirty thousand bucks some of this before you get paid\nAnd um that may take you two years the cash flow that instead of one you're not going to make this year unless you can find some way that the guys that are hiring for the season want to pay for it in return you promise to work there are three years or something like that you know and they want to pay for your hours or something maybe there's somebody looking\nFor a pilot that you know with that much intensity uh sometimes or an employer will pick up some education costs in order to get somebody on board if they're having trouble finding the help in that area\nHope that helps interesting destruction [noise]\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\n\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money

I deserve what's up\nWay thanks for taking my call ah I'm working I'm baby steps to enough to patch or you you mentioned that we pay off the smallest gets\nTo the biggest mhm so I'm to the point where how can chew up and I'm twenty eight hundred dollars a wind in fact she um I'll be payment over over payment on the Social Security mhm security uh and the other one is basically a full treated them mhm\nNow for the past month the for my kid only gets you got it from my wages mhm though I'm a big concern that if a part of the budget mhm sure\nSure go ahead and ... at the fire just continue paying minimum on the full one K. and just let the part of the budget or should I go ahead and just the kind that she'll security\nNot because it's part of the budget and I'm not because of interest rate but because Social Security a repayment on that can have heavy seas and um you're dealing with the government which has no so and so I I Would get them paid as fast as possible because I wouldn't want them out of my life\nAnd so for that reason I'm going to you know that's going to be the tie breaker twenty eight hundred versus twenty eight hundred on the debt snowball for me and ah I'd knock them out right quick now when you get to the four oh one K. you know you cannot pay extra on a four O. one K. loan monthly you will have to just save up and pay off the lump sum at one time\nI see what you're saying\nThat they will not let you pay an extra hundred dollars on it a month or five hundred dollars a month you just have to pay the whole thing off or pay the payments and so what you do is you just build up a big chunk of savings as your last bit and then when it when your savings gets up to equal to the four oh one K. above your a thousand dollar baby steps one then you knocked at four O. one K. loan out as quick as you can\nRyan's in Biloxi, Mississippi Hey Ryan welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey can I talk to you too sir what's up\nMy quick who was it about um\nYour credit score so I've only had\nOne alone I'm In my life I'm going through right now or had a small out alone when I brought my her car mhm I'm from a pay that off on I'm completely to rewrite now mhm\nBut I I decided to hop on a credit karma a little bit ago about maybe a month ago when I hurt my credit quarter conductor when it was on\nTo show we are huge fans of people who don't believe the case or something indoor I get home turn into millionaires the original book started everybody talking about those\nBack in the early Nineteen nineties when I wrote my first book when financial piece came out it was a book called the millionaire next door\nBut Dr Tom Stanley it changed the way everyone thought about millionaires I got to know ... a little bit a while he was living and I've gotten to know his daughter since then and I'm big fans of each of theirs and we're big fans of course of anyone who's in this millionaire space doing anything\nAnd as you guys know Chris Hogan has a million or a book coming out in January but Sarah for law is with us a Tom Standage daughter and a ... this was the first time we've ever talked on the air we've talked off the air and she has a new book coming out of the in belong with some of her dad's original research so Hi Sarah how are ya\nI'm good how are you in for having me on well\nI'm honored the new book is called the next millionaire next door in during strategies for building wealth and it it's out this week\nRight that's right yeah it's a it was a labor of love to have a father but you know it out and live LA that's about it\nYou know if you got to know her her dad passed in a car wreck or four years ago is now\nYeah it was a dollar Fifteen that's right yeah I don't say that\nI'm thinking I remembered that you know about there and I'm a we had to have him on several times over the years as we discuss this whole subject to millionaires and all of the some of the mythology litters around millionaires\nSo are you used some of the research from your dad's in Europe a professional researcher to like he was and uh and and I put this together tell me about the background on that part of it whatever this or did you do and more of it which combined with what he had done\nYet I think that that trade had we had worked together really on the initial fair day for the buck on you know really started back in the thousands of thinking about the ... anniversary is a millionaire next door like that it came out in the nineties\nAnd and work together on kind of what books should include and got to the point when we were just about an outlet survey on our fan or a primary and and who were killed by a drunk driver\nAnd and so really he wasn't able to either data and compare it to what was there in Nineteen Ninety six and and be on 'em and that kind of where I took out a chicken product and and kept going with it\nSure is an industrial psychologist and president of data points without a research and\nTechnology company that studies wealth accumulation and builds tools to help and you guys have to check this out its\nUm data points dot com has all the stuff on her research as well but you can get the new book the next millionaire next door in during strategies for building wealth at any major bookstore so the new data that you guys got as you put\nAnd then you've added to it shows with your continued research what were the ... was there anything that just shocked you in the findings where you should go out and see that one going\n[noise] yeah you know we but a lot at um some of them escaped though in that kind of behaviors that ... million ethnic related thing and I think what what I was\nJust like any am I trying to do the right thing um millionaire make mistakes along the way to ... to a lot of that sort of the ... the mistake at the role that they make related to him I think that that was the thing and then I think I think the idea was that a lot of things in terms of the kinds of\nOr rather the amount that they're spending on things like a furniture and clothing and things like that that some of the things that are surprising that were sort of spent more time\nYou know I was speaking in a church a couple of days ago and I told them one of the\nA key points that I've seen over twenty five years for doing this one to ... to do if you want to build wealth is you have to be careful who you hang around with because you become who you're running around ... and actually on the back of your book understanding how those around you influence your financial by a viewer's what'd you find on the\nYeah absolutely I think that again you see it very clear from the work we've done but I really believe in and out the every every day like I like\nThat they are um that that that social and different that not caring about what other driving and buying and wearing the really key factor in building well you know it's related to that were regardless of how old you are how much you make\n'em and I think you know now it's ... it's really hard you know more by what other people are doing research will medium set for it but\nIt continues to be there are just not hearing about what other people as well as as as one of the way while\nYou know I think in my case I was I was a unique because one of the benefits would going broke like I Do it in my twenties were violently was ... at that point I just reached all I wanted to do with survive\nAnd thrive and reach a point I just don't care what people think I still don't care what people think and I think that was a big contributor\nTo me personally to be able to to build wealth again after going bankrupt but I see it with other people as when you don't care what other people think about what your drive where you live what closure where whether you've been on vacation you're not trying to keep up with other people's Facebook version of themselves then you've got the ability to win\nAbsolutely and I think like I said I think that that on Facebook there isn't a lot a lot different right then what's really going on in our lives to something to keep in mind that we definitely see that and the research\nShe'll gaining knowledge and composure to invest in grow well that is a great work come closer to grow ... what do you mean by that\n[noise] that you know when you say that related to making attendance when it comes to mind that it really you know you could apply any kind of major financial decision that you're making a few have kind of call yourself before making a decision though and you know the example we get sometimes there's\nGoing to rain a lot of great time to go out and look for in a car because you're not if you're in an emotional state where you are so excited about the new income level that you have all the funding your decision making as well so he can stay home and come as\nA matter of what his financial affairs bar then you'd have a better chance of making the right one\nAnd I I often hear ah we've got a rubber inch personality does a career show on you're choosing a career and there's all this I'm a stuff about following your passion out there\nBut you guys have you found yet again in this new set of data the idea of a lifestyle related freedom does not equate to less income or less wealthy it actually ... the new\n[noise] yeah you know I think that's right I think that you know understanding that looking at your accent or or your interests let's say for your career Hackney ground and I'm kind of reality and and and I think that that's something that\nYou know a lot of people don't want to hear but it is true and so um if you had an accident or the arts and that's really where you want your career to go out and you know you take that with the reality that means it's certain things are going to be set aside\nFor that kind of again last night a lot of I don't want to hear but um we often have a happy here and said they'll say well\nYou know there's a price to be paid to build wealth and it's worth the price and nobody does that accidentally they'll do it with a plan\nI absolutely yeah that that one of the things that we can't thing over and over again and again let our time out millionaires or those that are on their way to becoming at\nThat time spent planning and and looking at your goals and monitoring what's going on in your financial life and not you know keeping your head and and um that that relate to building off as they can't do that effectively in court and go do it while\nWe're talking with Dr serve Stanley fellow all of a ... in your last night out offsite correctly\nAt a law\nSo I'll I'll I'll laugh yeah it's like I told me about one on there and uh so much with ups or I'm so sorry and a daughter of\nDr Tom Stanley a comic work called the millionaire next door a lot of you have read it if you haven't you should and you need to reach ... new book that she did combined with her ... research project that they were working on together when he passed away the new book is called the ... million or next door it is now out and you need to read it\nNow you know we've got a book out called a ... called everyday millionaire and

FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for Pfizer warrants and permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications John Solomon and Greg Jared continue with us anything I'm saying here that is wrong\nGreg Garrett you've got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian\nCollusion two people are on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele to compose is a totally fabricated phony document\nBased on supposed Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data\nAs well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and conspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that

right down to the point the FBI and the Justice Department were misuse for a political opposition research projects to a stop Donald Trump from becoming president and when that failed\nBase was saying I'm investigation that was designed to hamper his early presidency and that's what the overwhelming evidence out chosen and there's another important part\nThat Baker divulge as in the middle of my story but I Want to fight the south because many times I've heard you and I've heard Greg say the media has been complicit in this well a a a fake or gave us an unbelievable anecdote of complicity in November right after the election right after ... when the reporter David Corn of Mother Jones\nGives a new version of a ... copy it's different from the one the FBI has from steel and gives it to

you'd do not need and want to read a few more to you because\nI I've been I've been looking at this the amount of debt that students come out of school with\nThe enormous roast in these universities and this ... a Harvard professors or or what\nIs at Harvard professor his prediction his prediction that maybe half these university is going to be bankrupt in ten to Fifteen Years because there's so many and there's new technologies now people are doing things on line obviously a and you see that and I ran into somebody after the show yesterday\nI'm at an event just kind of a random meeting and they said they heard the show and they were like hey what happens to all these\nHousing or projects if students stopped coming\nAnd it's a good question I I Would imagine it most of these ah my no most of them are privately held so I Would imagine they would try to figure out other ways uh to to rent these units but a question I'm going to be having for more and more folks who come in who are in positions of of of power and authority especially over the Arizona board of regents\nUm is\nYou know is this a sustainable thing and is growing university to thirty three thousand students in a city of Seventy thousand is that sustainable\nAnyway this Harvard professor says if they may be going out of business not any you the name that just said half the universities but anyway I've been talking about jobs or the dead do not need\nA four year college degree they may need associates they may they may need a specialized training they may need just experience and more and more big companies like apple and Google setter are hiring people\nNot based on that degree on the wall but based on experience 'cause most people that come out of college they have a lot of book smarts which is fine I'm not knocking college folks but usually when the employer employees them\nThey have to retrain them and train them for those specific jobs so they're they're starting to look for more experience but anyway a few other jobs that do not require a four year degree um non retail sales manager fifty nine thousand dollar average\nElevator repair person sixty five thousand radiation therapist Seventy two thousand and my favorite\nCame during the show yesterday representative Bob Thorp a text to me he says hey also without a college degree you could be an Arizona State legislator for twenty four thousand dollars per year\nBut not in line with the pay of the other folks Bob but thanks thanks for that represented serve and I I Am going to get represented for back\nOn the show maybe next week at this point and I want to talk about his I'm pushing a bill that I think is an awesome bill and he did a great job introducing it last session and I hope he does it again and that's to try to\nCurtail cities and towns around the state from raising people's property taxes by two percent virtually automatically all the time and the bill is simple\nGo to the voters ask them ceremony asked them if they agree with what you have in mind to spend anyway folks wrapping up the\nUh education part here you know what you need to work hard and this is what I say to those just starting out and uh those looking to find a field to be and you need to work hard and when you're at that point where you don't think you can work any harder\nNeed to dig deep and work harder\nAnd so the millennials buying into this ... just left this dribble about socialism and you know leveling the playing field blah blah blah blah blah\n... if you think you deserve something or if you think you deserve a living wage or a super high minimum wage you don't\n... ... and\nFolks lines open eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one would love to hear from you coming up we\nHave write in candidate for mayor George river below else expecting a former Flagstaff mayor Jerry neighbors and professor Travis Smith of ... university and talking about the defensiveness in politics in America today you're listening to Jeff or show back in a minute\n[noise] folks\nI Want to tell you about the law office of have this Reich ... strike specializes in business real estate and landlord

hundred\nBack in the morning and more stimulating talk from the Ninety seven point one big talker studios and always online at big talker radio dot com I mean all the Evan Williams\nI'm your thoughts on should we slow this down should are you a supporter for eight I\nActually ah am a supporter for Eighteen I'm\n... and principally here's why government does nothing well in my opinion uh and mandating private industry to raise wages\nOn a schedule entirely defeats the ... the the\nMerit based raises where you take out the ability for people to be rewarded for being a better employee than say the next guy it takes the incentive out of hard work in my opinion\nAnd uh George ... my my guest running as a write in candidate for mayor for Flagstaff and\nUm I've heard from lots of business owners I've got more folks coming in tomorrow on this issue um about lower ... not lower levels employment but less hours mhm I'm we're seeing the stress I but I don't see the stress the economic stress but I don't think we've witnessed\nThe full stress that we may see coming up regarding this wage issue because the economy's doing so well right you see the numbers you see the national numbers

road\nAs a city heaven forbid I don't want to know the recession but we know these are cyclical things or we set ourselves up for some real bad problems down the road here [noise]\nTo me it's it's really simple\nBusinesses have to make a certain amount of money not don't misunderstand there's some there's some businesses out there that can afford to pay more than others that can't afford to pay what say others can't I'm\nWith that said if we continue to cause this is to have to pay more they're passing out onto the consumer\nAnd they're going to either they're going to charge more or as you say they're going to reduce ... hours or they're going to cut positions\nWould you have supported a counselor an opportunity to change this and get it on the ballot quicker and now we've had another set of increases would you voted to get this on the ballot quicker\nOr to let the people have a quicker decision and and have it on the ballot say earlier in the euro versus the general election\nYeah up probably so uh I I think there's a lot of people out there who even were originally for the wage increase and as a scene there their salaries go up there not necessarily seeing\nThe buying power that say this was promised to give them\nUm we have [noise] many communities in in Arizona a Sedona for example I that traffic nightmare uh Prescott traffic nightmare\nFlagstaff traffic nightmare I'm ... and it's getting worse and worse I've been talking a lot recently about any you northern Arizona university and the growth\nAnd um they they want to grow up to about thirty three thousand students there's twenty something thousand there now you see tremendous pressure on the militant avenue court or for example and and now there's talk of any you know they've bought Thirteen million and property who the heck knows what they're going to do with it\nUm is there any way out of the traffic problems there's a couple of propositions on the ballot they want to do a potentially an overpass downtown over the railroad tracks but it's a huge a price tag a it's a it's a it's a huge price tags and do this thing is that really going to solve anything what do we do I mean your mayor\nGoodness gracious I mean no one is is built out to what it is they're not there's not a whole lot of space out there to to build out on the streets we tear down\nWhat we could yeah that's what they're doing yeah yeah well then report now\nPutting employment out you know we're taking businesses and were put him out of business and now we're losing jobs um it's not an easy answer Jeff it really isn't um and I haven't I don't have the exact answer for him well like I said who does I I\nWell they haven't done it yet it hasn't been solved yet yeah it gets worse and worse and my concern with uh the push for thirty or thirty three thousand people exist there's strong strong evidence that\nThe trend is away from brick and mortar enrollment and going to on line so I'm I'm all for education don't misunderstand what I'm saying but are there are some strong a evidence is out there that in the very near future these numbers are actually going to decline because of the availability of online

know but I I don't think that for most in their mind and so you have this committee gets made up of ... and the attorneys are not picked by the board of supervisors picked by the state bar of Arizona\nYou get a mixture of people that are doing this review of the applicants\nAnd then for reading your names to the governor\nIn a very good process and Jeff I saved just from personal observation I Am on the committee that does the screaming and and and recommendation for the state court the court of appeals in Arizona Supreme Court\nAnd I have to tell you we've we've been through the interview and in a lecture process now several times\nSince I've been on there and\nIt is really well done and very objective and this this is definitely a case where people put the politics aside okay\nAnd the names that are sent to the governor by the way they have to be a mixture they cannot all the of one party or the other\nOne jury I got to ask you this because you sit on that committee and you're involved in selecting people I'm a ... is it\nDo you worry that it's going to get really much of a lot more part I mean you look at the Kavanaugh hearings for example I Know that's on the Supreme Court level I'm In touch so partisan or are you even you tell me you're not even see in kind of a whistle that on this committee which I Would imagine is made up of people have different political persuasion is is that the case\nIt is the case they're very definitely the case and we know that we have to select a mixture of parties and names to the governor can't all be of one party and\n... and on this committee we've got Democrats and Republicans and independents like me and\nI'm and I can tell you Jeff we set that aside you go there will be a motion to you know I recommend this person\nAnd that was is that is a real top notch candidate usually good you know numerous vote yes let's send that named to the governor regardless of party\nAnd in Jeff I have to mention that there are a lot of good Rogers potential judges in Coconino county who would never run for election\n... they would they would be happy to a quieter they're good attorney ... top notch attorneys\nThey would love to be a judge they would be more than willing to apply and be interviewed to be a judge but they are not going to run for election\nDon't want to go through the process and\nIt yeah exactly you know get all of them nomination petition signatures and you know ask people for donations then put out your signs and you know you're Raleigh advertising it's very very under the coming for a judge to have to do all that\nAnd a lot of people are not willing to do that they just don't know if that's what I have to do I'm not going to do it but if there was an opening I Would be more than willing to apply\nI'm not going to do it but if there was an opening I Would be more than willing to apply\nAll right though that the best thing about this merits what crosses the best quality
