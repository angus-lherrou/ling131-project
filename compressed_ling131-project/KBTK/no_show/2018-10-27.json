delighted to be on your show because you're alive and you talk about issues every time I tell the press that eighty two percent of those bills on the score Carter bipartisan they don't want to talk about it they just want to\nAttack the president and I said what do you like the president or not\nThree of those votes are for our veterans eleven of them are are regulations seven to them or to keep the government open and fully fund our military funding\nAnd I age you know I'm the only one in the region in the Washington region whose Republican inside the beltway and if you don't have a Republican and a Republican administration [noise]\nThis is going to be a one party town and will be like Chicago or Baltimore where you don't have different voices you know speaking up and and working for our local region\nSo I think it's really important that we have a voice that it's going to be able to work with the administration for priorities for the northern Virginia\nNow here's here's your opponent West is not just a Democrat and I will be fine cheesy radical\nShe will join the radicals in the house of representatives I mean the hard core radicals the open border radicals the massive government radicals and\nSo forth and so on and I'm Nancy\nPelosi has put in over a million dollars in the race and now Bloomberg's coming in and doing two million because they saw what we saw in our polling which is the races tied very close\nAnd they kept saying they thought they had it all put away but I'll tell you we're we're in here we are fighting because if we can get this great record that we have of you know growing the economy getting more people back to work um you know passing the opioid legislation that the president signed this week at the White House\nThat I was there with Democrats and Republicans celebrating that we got this national emergency in the opioid crisis six billion dollars that were doing to help and the press doesn't want to talk about that so I appreciate you being a place where we talk about issues\nAnd the good things that we're getting done for the country and my opponent opposes this agenda and just wants to resist were about results there about resistance on about you know getting things there that improve the quality of life in advance our economy protect\nYou know our citizens public safety I been endorsed by the police benevolent association but I've also been endorsed\nBy and supported by the federal employees pack as well as every business group involved so I brought together a diverse coalition\nWhat what kind of groups of back your opponent\n[noise] um well the uh the the metro union group that is running and attach\nOut I keep threatening to shut down the um the metro in the Washington DC area and violate yeah in violate the law and they're attacking\nMe for not raising taxes so my opponent attacks me and then people like this ... this is a union that was so\nYou know this functional that the Obama administration supported suited and that's who supporting her and and other union groups but she hasn't gotten you know any business endorsements she wouldn't even sit down to interview with the police benevolent association and this is someone she put\nHer own staff into fake parties city costumes\nAs police in or out to imply that she had the support of the police when in fact the police have endorsed and supported me because of my record\nOn public safety on let me let me let me ask you this before on at a\nTime roads big deal in northern Virginia on there's a lot of road construction going on and that's even before the president pushes through an infrastructure program but she's a heavy duty tax or on the toll road is\nYeah well see was ... that that those forty six dollar told that you see when you go into Washington she was for them before she was against them and you know she was on the committee that you know that they put through that but more importantly is she saying she was against them yet Terry McAuliffe who put that into place\nHow she was ineffective and persuading him now you look at something where I Know we might disagree on this but I really advocated for the I'm a pay raise\nFor our federal employees and the president and you know the administration initially was going to do a pay freeze\nAnd I went to them politely made my case and talked about why it was important that the people who you know at the FBI the CIA all this you know that they got their pay raises so they can do the good work they did and you know arresting this a\nCharacter that they got today and so um I work politely with the administration on that she was ineffective and getting Terry McAuliffe to do anything I'm In and get rid of those forty six dollar tolls and so we need somebody who's affective who can work with\nYou know a Republican administration or Democrats I've demonstrated that and and I've always been\nSomeone advocating lower taxes [laughter] sorry and public\nSafety which is why I'm thrilled to have the support of our police and\nI knew a you are in a tough district to marginal districts\nIn what they're hoping of course is that they can scare the hell out of everybody in northern Virginia\nA particularly the federal workers and others and the teachers the usual unions and so forth to turn those people out and what they've done in the Democratic party is they've selected the most extreme radical Nancy Pelosi like candidate they possibly could\nAnd they're hoping to turn the entire area blue so it's crucially important\nLet me speak to live and I sat there many conservatives out there as well I don't know it is crucially important\nSo it's crucially important let me speak to all of a nights out there many conservatives out there as well I don't know it is crucially important that you come out and vote up and down the ticket and you come out and vote for Barbara Comstock\nUm she may not be as conservative as you like but she's not a radical cook like the er like her opponent who clearly is\nAnd I've known you for decades and I know you're a person of integrity and ethics\nAnd I think it's very important that the that the people come out and vote for you conservatives moderates independents at the Republican Party unite as the Republican Party's uniting all over the country 'cause this is a different kind of a lecture I'll give you a sixty more seconds\nWell I I thank you mark for highlighting and really talking about the issues that matter here and we just have a great opportunity

so it's always a question too much human DNA too little human\nDNA then you don't get the human organs right if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature that thinks like him and that has basically human brain\nTrapped inside of a body of a sheep or pick I mean these these are the things that are very real now because of our ability to tamper with DNA um so that's one of the things that gives me gives me a little bit later that we really wanted to and what's\nOur ability to tamper with DNA um so that's one of the things that give me give me a little bit later that we really wanted\nTo and what's interesting is that these guys are doing it\nAnd by the way I quote one of the researchers that says yeah that's that's a real possibility says it's not like you know made a pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this possibility but they're doing this research against the wishes of the anti age the national institutes of health\nWhich is the government never won funding body for biological genetic engineering so even an ice age it's kind of very um [noise] yeah you know forward thinking funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just pushed the pause button and decide do we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines for\nThe guard rails are I'm sure I'm sure these guys are not just doing it in violation of the agent probably doing it against the advice of their moms like what are you yeah yeah you know oh my\nOh my God it reminds me when I was growing up in east LA and then ... the town over and I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found my mom's kitchen\nAnd I look back and I'm Out there in the garage at the ... of our how [laughter] making hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\nYou know but I Would fill\nBalloons up with it and then send little insects aloft just to see what happens ethic\nOh I was a little mad scientist and\nCreate your own space program against their will right by the way\nThat they can marry you're right the mothers I say why don't you know right in that already go this is quite Hitler links or something safer\nMentioned LA ... as you mentioned LA I Want to mention that the the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston\nAnd LA you kidding me know so I just thought I'd seen standing\nFifteens any game three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like thinking of pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz you said the kind of works and so I don't know I guess I guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors because that's how that's how it was happening but right now still there's two men on top of the fifteenth and we're we'll keep\nAn eye on it so All right so let's put the island of Dr Morrow things pretty scary it really is but I I still you know now do you think of what the technology that people you see all the commercials for which I'm\nYou know we're theory you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look on the windows series is it snowing\nYou know or you know Google by ... by ... you know by makes them more attend meet whatever in these commercials and everybody's focused on that type of it's just and I kind of get it but\nThey were just beginning to learn the downs of having a microphone connected um and on monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another it's interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things to worry about and that's your thing we're bringing about our cell okay you're a ... if you're\nAbsolutely right I tell the story of a little girl in Dallas texas\nWho use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by me you know there's a doll house the fancy fancy dollhouse and parents are totally clueless stuffed starts arriving at the house the parents freak out\nBut here's the punch line and you would think that the parents will have learned a lesson and like ditch the echo you know get rid of it uh but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around ... election now are you\nKidding me I mean that's the takeaway leaders [laughter] yeah I Know it's\nSo big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story\nAnd ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing in the line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but but that story out of turkey about the supposedly\nThe audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and death now I I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter\nMaybe it there in the Saudi constantly they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor it that way but however it happened\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening\nThat is going on that we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our country I've just had an op ed that is going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so a saying that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on a a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nThe anger that kind of a ... year three injuring or your dishwasher everything that's going to\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now are more than eight billion\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book and the Chinese are ... see this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show key thing in\nNinety seven point one coast to coast more stimulating talk coast to coast Ninety seven point one the big talk more stimulating talked\nMichael before we started getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before because I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't mess and that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a the these women wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story from the hospital\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is\nSure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this\nThis kind of a Internet of things that are fine on every aspect of our life that can tell you when you're at sleep when you're awake how many feet you are what your heart rate uh you know if you watch Netflix the the the they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean\nThere that this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited\nOn ourselves than we are well these gadgets\nYeah and I liked him a lot of them I mean I were an apple launched by the way they use that as a plot device that thing about the ... been in a ... a law and order episode last week the same thing same\nCook it for the real life oh did you know they always do you know ripped from today's headlines so he um but that's where I mean I think that they\nLike to catch a killer is one thing when people listen to all good they got a killer because of the ... the hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection systems which accidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime\nI mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having this humongous database of face prince\nRunning a that they've not you're not covering\nThe ... yeah and and and and they have like an eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent\nAccuracy rate for the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent inaccuracy\nRunning with which raises the possibility that you and I got to have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their database but the facial recognition technology that they're using to id and could finger culprits it's wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way\nResearchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere are saying it's it's more than twenty percent and so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people are going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA Michael deal in the end of life as we know it let's get you Keith who's in Virginia on coast to coast am key\nHello can you hear me in a perfectly\nGood a night on my own turned back up\nTo go and get a question from Michael\nYes my home and I argue or speaking about the ah Jarvis cart have a couple of friends one of which I Would be a great guess because it's very experience\nAnd service even there's a whistle blower this call them coast to coast and before but a great to have them on to tell a story\nAbout a lot of things [noise] um well I'm a I'm\nA predecessors that artificial heart was a a\nHeart open heart surgery that was a heart lung machine\nAnd Dr wrestling Nelson or\nWorked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that a sharp a cart was at the University of Utah\nAnd some Thirty years earlier and he and his career as a heart surgery I had some paranormal experience is one of which was\nA where\nHe did a surgery that a technique that had never been done before and he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically it's as if a ... or whatever was\nPut right in his mind and he did the surgery a from those instructions that he was able to see in his mind and later\nI got to get you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so if you want to hang on for an open line called the sounds more like that but did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah I'm a rough someone else and by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to the cause I Know there is who we have our time is pressures and I open lines is where that kind of belong\nSo let me go to a Tracy who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracy\nMichael I got one question for you here where does it end whereas stop why do we stop playing God\nOr are we ... we as a good question but are we playing God yet and when do we played God is maybe is another question but Michael\nWell I think that is the ultimate question the traits he's asking and ah you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book um who was actually a a major\nAnd uh you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book um who was\nActually a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president\nHe said now we have discovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book\nAnd ... and it's a very telling quote and I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who was in the thick of it\nAnd this this is directly an answer to trace is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about\nAnd and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture a child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with\nA dynamite you know you pick your your your ticket imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you can have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics\nBut all it takes is one sticker that\nCan really within right there but does everything else\nBut I think that's the crux two of the playing God premise are we playing God or are we would we cure a disease\nIf the diseases natural it was as God made it natural and yours is hurricanes are we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid this phrase although I Know it's a popular place phrase\nRightly that's what I'm saying it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really in compass all the ways in which\nYou know when we make a better break pad or do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but was that really a matter of playing God I I think it's more true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [noise]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplants I I mean that can be said we're playing\n... to ... what I like to do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oilfields on fire oh totally\nI what I was the first TV correspondent to actually find my way to those oil field\nA oh a oil fields that were on fire and the way I had to get there was through a minefield we got a guy from a ramp ... a Saudi Arabian oil company he knew our way through the mind feels and so that's how I I think of traces question is\nI see as their icy as navigating a mine field\nAnd you know so far we've been able to avoid a stepping on that one mine that's going to do with them\nBut as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous nevermind a great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine but I I say all it takes for us to do is to step on that one mind that one hit and mine\nNow

time period and then it represents there's a way to look in the end it or more information and then if you try to Islam\nIt is like page after page after page and the regular section and so you know anything about it\nNow and it's very interesting it's very but I Wish it was a good look over your shoulder well you're talking you're doing that\nAnd it's in a box there you know and I just kind of way in that kind of feel like like they're not really even [laughter]\nYou don't usually do a huge interesting we choose the idea that I mean like the as you said I\nI I Know there are still printing the must you'll be printing a version Hawkins or they don't completely they don't want anything to\nDo that after the second to the laugh loud I'd have to buy it gave them hung up or at home and all that I started looking up things like why why their kids and they get this plan so yeah you find out I mean if you could do home or on\nTo serve I'll take a look at that I'm very treatment that ideas so they'll have to wait maybe tomorrow night if I could figure out something between now tomorrow night or I Will and I appreciate that and I'll get to see if I Do it will be in the first hour tomorrow night\nAn otherwise I'm not sure it will be back on again and Thanksgiving so it may have to wait a while but let me see what I Do but they use really it's really very interesting let me go to Karen who is in Alaska\nOn coast to coast AMA Karen\nHi um this late in she was just saying and it definitely tied in with last night there was some get and um it the show was short um first of all I wanted to say you are by far my favorite\nOther than that to gorge but you seem to be afraid of controversial subject [laughter]\nThough it comes with age [laughter]\nSo you know politically correct though we can't talk about or they just\nYou know I I I guess that is funny because I I should listen more maybe I'm I'm Out of step maybe I should I should be more like ... you will your ... and I'll Try out what what\nI wanted to change the subject to in like I said yeah go along with what she would say and I'll tell you a few things I'll get off the air and everybody else\nCan put in a sense where um that Mandela Effect first of all you've probably heard about it there yet knowing last memory you yeah well that's all they face off memory\nUm that Mandela Effect first of all you've\nProbably heard about it there yet knowing memory you yeah well\nThe last rebel they face off memory in the world remembers that one way and then suddenly it's not and and last night the example they gave with them I Believe it was I say I live in six in the Bible the wolf and lamb versus the way we grew up hearing about the lion and the land that a couple of other examples and and it's in any like when you're confined\nExcept get threat I got catalog in the mail today\nAnd somebody had a prayer because he was saying last night they had also changed the Lord's Prayer and maybe 'cause the catalog grant like minded I don't know for our comfort her ... remember what it was but anyway it was the way we remembered it\nSo Luke I Am your father now if you look at the movie it says no I Am your father um the things that have changed life with like a box of chocolate you watched that movie now Forrest Gump\nLife is like a box of chocolate Sally Field you remember when she\nSaid her really liked me you like me are right right now they're saying\nIf you watch it now says she says you really liked me now\nOkay that's interesting when\nNo not when he was saying the encyclopedia\nHow you have a couple of paragraphs about ... pages and pages tomorrow that last night and I agree with this it's like I said I've been doing the research for a couple of year and a half maybe so they've been saying they're earning baby that they're they said something about their goal was to make a I don't know Cornel into another dimension\n... think demon into our yeah well they were doing say panic rituals outside that place\nI'm and I'm Wondering if maybe that's why they're diminishing Jesus now and and my comment that the as we all know what he does you know the things he believes in any way\nThe other things that would certainly do she'll do will be there'll be a victim of the Mandela Effect well even as you think about it because you\nKnow nightmares more but here's here's what I Want to IRS when I propose would be the ... the thing I mentioned to you about Islam\nAnd about ... about uh Mohammed is that what we often do and I think you're you're getting to this ... this is a completely fair point is that we we rely on other people to give us our memory\nAnd so we think we heard something we think we remember it away to hear somebody else and then somehow we insert their memory in two hours and and and whenever we may have held we might have originally thought of the line the way it was you know but then more people repeat it\nAnd that's the only way that you you know that that they can hear it so I think the Mandela Effect is very interesting\nI think it's compelling I'm Sorry I missed the show we run a great examples um I Will say when it comes to Bible translation just remember this\nIt you can't do a perfect translation into English from Hebrew in Greek not from that era Hebrew enough that era Greek\nIt's impossible to do perfect translation there will always be changed\nAnd some of them are just as simple ones some of them are just you know pronouns in people in ... the name of the person that was talking because it's easier to follow the story but you are changing it you know just by dropping a permanent and putting a person's name and then others are much trickier because there are verbs that literally don't exist anymore\nAnd so we have to quibble informed facing was a verb for a long time I am facing\nAnd we just don't use that terminology so you know the fact of the translations keep changing that's great that's the way to be ... ... ... ... I Hope not politically correct purposes but because it's just a matter of getting it\nCorrect which I think is more interesting All right so let me go to um uh Marty who is in Tulsa and the time we have left on goes to goes to a a Marty\nAnd is a pleasure I'm honored uh first I've ever tried to call and the coast to coast I've been listening to her like others for years and years I had to hit the readout about fourteen times that I was surprised to be able to get on\nLeading right\nI had a and it's nice by the way to hear your back on coast once in awhile I bought you uh had disappeared forever\nOf Eighteen or something with your any kind of hard to imagine when you're dating hanging\nAround about ten thirty one year and when you are a little\nThan the project he did not come out\nOn your holiday time for\nWho are now somehow holiday time dream or whatever is on your land which I\nTry not to try\nNinety seven point one the big di di di di ... northern Arizona is more stimulating dog\n\nHistory made at the world series and Jane ...

I mean all hanging Emma we tested we go through three walls up\nTwo pieces of sheet rock separated by insulation so we're going through one wallet or room to another well into a room and then out the next call wall\nThe only thing we found that won't do that is a shotgun using bird shocked\nAnd I shut and using birch out is amazingly effective at inside most room distances when you're inside less than ten yards bird shot is stunningly lethal and effective\nAnd yet ah the small shot seven and a half a shot will not go through a whole bunch of walls and when it does just doesn't have much energy so I don't know if that helps you is that is that going to help you at all Alex\nOh yeah\nOkay and you know I mean obviously you talking about a shotgun and I would say twenty gauges perfectly fine adequate for self defense stuff inside and use regular bird shot because you know the drill if you know shotguns at all if you're at ten feet\nOr less in something like that you're shooting a water shot that's you know maybe two inches across at most it's essentially functioning like a slug it takes people part\nA and yet when it hits the sheet rock all that little small shots going to spread out and if it goes through the wall at all it might pepper somebody on the other side but chances are it's not even going to do that if I were in your situation that would be my choice for self defense low look I appreciate the call\nIf people get upset about it and they worry about it and go okay well [noise]\n[noise] [noise] the idea that\nSomebody would sell you full metal jacket into it and maybe itself I don't know maybe the cells and didn't know that was intended to be self defense Emma I don't know but look\nThis is up to you\nYou're the one who has to decide what's appropriate for what you're doing you have to figure out okay this is a self defense load is this the best thing and I'm I'm Sorry I don't want to denigrate people who work in gun stores but the sad reality is there are\nA lot of people who don't know what they're talking about who work behind the counter to gun stores and that is especially true\nWhen you get to some places where people buy em oh like Wal Marts or big box stores\nAre places where you may be buying ammo right next to the state department and the guy who is waiting on you and the gun\nSection was working in the paint department last week he heard 'cause somebody told him that this would be the right thing and now he's telling you because he's an expert because he's been working behind the gun counter for a week\n[noise]\nDo your own research go look on our website gun talk dot com go look at our videos where we actually test this stuff you know it's like well how do you know that's true well I Know it should because they've tested\nI shot a lot of ammo through a lot of walls to find out what goes through what does twenty two years ago to a couple of walls\nUm every handgun and I think every hand got above a caliber twenty two goes to all three walls certainly al rifles do um you know it doesn't this is interesting and it's weird all rifles except two to three\nWeirdly enough and they are Fifteen does not go through all those walls and it doesn't matter if you use the help or not\nI Know that there's counter intuitive 'cause you think well let's go Patrick whoever they use the full metal jacket two to three you know it actually does it the ... gene returned sideways you might go through to alls but we could I don't think we ever got one to go through a third wall she didn't have a two to three\nUh three awaits hunting rifles of course not a problem they'll go through all of those but that was interesting that the A R Fifteen\nBecause I Would never use that for ... well actually you might want to\nIf you're particularly what I Would do I would use ... bullets those very fast expanding bullets that essentially disintegrate on the impact that would be affected it stopped being attacker and\nThey won't go through multiple walls in the rec oil is low\nAnd it's easier to hit what you're aiming at with a rifle let's see oh yeah and you would have a lot of animal they should you need it because sometimes these home invasions involve multiple bad guys\nOne thing I Would offer and this and I was going to sound crazy to some people keep a pair of electronic curing buffs next to your bed at night that way with you get a bump in the night you can put on your ear mobster you could turn them on\nThey amplify sounds you could hear what's going on to the other rooms if unfortunately had to actually shoot inside your house you maybe don't lose your ... where you would lose his seat\nAnd they are inside your house you can definitely just just food for thought hey let me come back here to

four liquor days since we were too late for that but it Joe's bar there was an extensive collection of critters that Joe harvested from several comments for good to no good for Joe I\nAlso ah from ah

is I remember\nWhat was interesting to me was learning I mean I Do the John Brown was genius I just didn't know how to get the guy was\nIf you were in Salt Lake Erie is absolutely worth the trip to go up to Ogden to see this museum it's not huge but it's very impressive\nUh it's interesting that after all these years some of his guns are still being used in military and of course people are still using obviously the Nineteen eleven\nSome would say one of his greatest pieces by that would certainly be Mike\nArgument is it the Nineteen eleven pistol ... forty five if you prefer is certainly one

somewhere\nIt's I'm not trying so let me just say right up front I have not tried this okay it sounds as though it would work there when I Believe him\nIt was simply this is where does it sounds it now of course this as soon as your doors not glass because if it is then they'll break the glass and walk in through the um but if your front door or whatever it is is solid enough to keep you from walking through it you\nTake your\nMilwaukee drill and you drill a hole in your four right behind the door [noise] and then you dropping a long wait a screwdriver and all the whole\nThat's yeah\nThat's a great idea that that's a good idea in general\nYou just you know as you think they think and and you want it so that the handle of the screwdrivers pretty much up against the door\nAnd he said you can't open the door now I don't know that that's true it just one of those reports I've heard\nBut if you had like a home invasion folks trying to kick in your door a said you know the base they'll have to take the hinges off and break it from that side nobody from that side to get it it's not that well I don't know if that's true but it sure sounds as though it would work\nUh so I I pass along for whatever its work I mean then I have no knowledge of it no experience with it and it's\nOffered with absolutely no guarantee are warranted okay\n[noise] oh I appreciate that I'll give

representatives yeah great experience and\nAll around northern Arizona and you might have seen my billboards and yard signs etc all throughout the northern Arizona region and a very active in the community and to look for the positive difference and hope of books out\nIn the region store joined the firm is because he does have quite a financial background and you know I read stored number of years ago the vice president of the chamber of commerce journal and then there's a little slice of chamber right and you know the thing is you know Stewart you really have a beautiful face or radio

you back well do you where\nDo we just got an honorary today [laughter] we're here you're the roads between to Florida [laughter] we got a buddy of coffee you know that's why we're ready to you know I dabble\nI got my work cut out for me that you know one of the things we're going to focus on today that we were chatting about a little bit off line\nIs financial wellness and how much having a healthy mind and body really goes hand in hand with having healthy finances that you know what most of us know what to expect when we go in for a check up on our physical health\nBut we don't know what to expect for a financial check out so that's where I'd like to begin today garnish how do we get started with that\nWell you know me being a doctor on radio so I think I guess I can talk about financial help [laughter] so I've always talked to people about a financial checkup is extremely important\nAnd you know you have to have just like you would go get your you know oil changed on every three thousand miles and it's funny in our industry is that the you know there's a saying in our industry that guys take better care of their vehicles and take care of their health you know\nAnd in women live longer because they take better care of their health and so that's kind of important aspect of what we're doing here\nOne of the things we found was that like you're supposed to do\nA physical every year with a doctor in and get a check up and so for doing that on your finances extremely important as well because you know a lot of times you don't realize there's a problem and you know you're too far down the road\nAnd you know if there's any kind of corrections or strategy change that has to happen we want to be able to implement and make those changes as soon as necessary\nWe're talking today with the ... owner and founder of our financial group and you weren't McDaniel is here with us as well he's part of a team that for a financial and I'm generally jak alongside his retirement ... powered by for a financial group\nIs that when you get in your car and you start driving\nAnd the first stop you would say would be you know like going if you're on I forty you'll be going towards Williams the first step would be Williams then it'd be so women then it'd be Kingman\nSo theoretically when you're looking at this you're not getting to check your tires and things like that until you get to a gas station right and if you need gas that's what you're doing\nBut what happens is if there's a problem between that distance you're absolutely unaware of four fifty sixty ... even a hundred miles versus what happens in retirement planning\nIs that a lot of times people say you don't you know check a couple of years or you know most of the most of what we've seen is that people have come in and they said you know I had a financial plan done ten years ago mhm and I go and then what and they\nWere ... years ago and I think we're on track I I don't know I I go how can you be so sure or are you sure and most people I sit down with they really don't limit their on track when uh they just goes you know life is happening\nAnd we have an advisor that's kind of managing your accounts and I think we should be good when most people don't realize is when I first started in this industry back in the early nineties\nThe rate of return or projections that were being used were significantly higher\nThan what we consider using today and I was speaking to another financial advisor in our community\nAnd realize that they're using a pretty robust rate of return in projections on their portfolio so you know it always looks like you're going to make so much more money and\nThen you create your spending plan around how much money you think you're going to have\nAn intern you're good to have a significant shortfall because it didn't perform up to that level\nAnd so part of this also is we won't talk about risk management\nYou know if you look back you know this year will use the ... example I I don't want to go very ... data on the timing but if you just look back this year we've had significant volatility in the market and the recent months uh we've had quite a bit and I think\nPeople don't realize if the markets are up or down because you know sometimes they turn on the TV and it says\nYou know the S. and P. hits new highs are Dow Jones industrial average has hit new high and they think\nThey're making all this money but then they don't realize that too after that the Dow Jones industrial as gun that over five hundred boy or something like that you don't know maybe several thousand points in back in that case so those are the kinds of things\nThat have a five hundred points or something like that you write or maybe several thousand points in ... in that case\nSo those are the kinds of things that you know when we create a plan that's what we're addressing we're really addressing the safety component of your plan so here's the thing if you're going to Los Angeles and here\nAnd the road map you know your Google Drive or whatever you you have any more what do you call them nowadays wherever the navigation\nSystem navigation ... yeah ... ... you know I I still go back and think about you know like I was thinking about the Rand McNally road atlas writes most of us travel back in the day before all this stuff came out\nYou know we have to we actually have to lay it out and make a plan and really understand that you know if you drove respectable speed limit and you know considering traffic and so for that you would get to your destination\nIn a certain period of time and that's where people are really losing the focus is that you know too much electronics is in the way too much garbage is going in their heads from watching TV and so forth\nAnd everybody's chasing returns what I mean by that is that you know people are looking to make as much money as possible but they don't realize what the downside stroke up that would be right\nAnd if you just kinda go back and look at\nWhat happened to two thousand seven two thousand Eighteen sure you're in Tucson at that time 'cause I was new saw you know big cities even worse\nWell absolutely seeing if folks there were a hundred percent quite into real estate because at the time you know the real estate market was booming in the early to thousands meant and things were great until it wasn't and people lost half of\nTheir their value overnight they couldn't give it away correct right I mean we just saw people who were unprepared and and they didn't have that they didn't realize the things aren't going to keep going the same way with her up or down and said not to panic and then that the whole holistic approach\nBut it also provides opportunities as well you know how to\nWrite so you know I mean you know when we look at the market so we're seeing you know we have big upswing in the market and then you see big down swinging the market right and\nThen we see panic\nAnd we see ... you know you get to see all kinds of emotions right either greed fear panic all that stuff right anger and\nYou know we we find is that when people don't have a plan the emotions get the best of\nRight and and bad things you know we we all go through difficulty throughout the day right that doesn't mean it's gonna ruin our day\nAnd then that's the whole thing that we have a plan to move forward whatever it might be as we're going out to vacation going on a trip whatever it is a we have a plan that we're gonna move forward and that and that's how we approach or the financial plans as well and how important that is because without that plan that's when the panic that thing that\nWe've had a bull market for probably a decade at this point and\nIt's been well you know like I mean if you look at the ten years the markets pent up but you know the volatility that's have come into play has been pretty significant in two thousand eleven you know if you're just at home and one for giggles if you look at the Dow chart in two thousand eleven\nAnd you go back and look at two thousand and two thousand a charge he was an exact mimic the markets and the charts where exactly mimicking that instead of going down\nWhat happened was the federal government stepped in and then they get infused much money in the market right and that's what kind of ... the mark it up and it's gone up since the end you know in the long term we see the markets will go up by the fact is that if there's a major market correction\nAnd you know you are retired and you're reliving off this money\nAnd you're taking out say a thousand a couple of thousand maybe three ... three thousand dollars a month out of that account\nAnd your portfolio overnight just got chopped in half because the markets went down right and you're just you know the thing it's a short term volatility and usually you know in in oh seven or eight when the market corrected\nThat was it all happened within six months and that was considered a short term volatility but he was a major market correction and if you know anyone that's retired um and they're retired you know seven away\nAnd if you're thinking about retirement and you're not really thinking about rescue should have a conversation with one of these folks that were affected by this and you probably know them and\nWhat happened there was if they were taking money out out of their investment account for the IRA count as it's chopped in half because markets went down\nAnd they took him seven years to get back to where they were but if you're drawing against it\nYou will never recovered that money and there's a great chance that you will run out of money a lot sooner and blunt and he's speaking I'd be this wrecking ball we always talk about ... when the market's going one way is beautiful you know everybody's smiling and laughing\nAnd will swing vent pendulum swings the other way [laughter] it's a wrecking ball you know who this is a portfolio and you know like Stewart was a part of the of mortgage company and you know a voice your title and more movies banker or else the mortgage banker lightest first magazine the financial and yeah\nThe company went out of business right yeah and and that happened to to a lot of folks I mean companies that were highly leveraged didn't up again plan a for for long term or the issues and and that's what happened with them\nAnd you know in the thing is that most people\nHave to have a significant um analysis that she does the analysis done to understand what kind of risk they can actually afford to take right and you know we we do run into a lot of people that say well you know I have bombs in my portfolio that's safe\nI don't know how to answer this question but I always say you don't want you to call people that own\nThe LA county bonds reds would last for their went bankrupt right or or whatever you Troy right and you know I mean you can go down the line and you know the end depending on what kind of bombs you're buying but you know I mean there's still a significant risk associated with it\nThe other thing we also look at uh when we talked about the risks portion of it\nIs that uh the fed has been talking about they're going to raise the interest rate\nAnd what happens in bonds that most people don't think about they think most people are taught wrong but they are taught that stock market and bond market work against each other meaning that their stocks are up the bombs are going to be down and bonds are up the stocks are going to be down well that is not true\nWhat effects the bond market is the interest rate in the interest rate is going up the bonds are going to go down in value and it you know if the interest rate goes down the bombs go up in the ice if you just mentally see a seesaw\nAnd if you put bombs on one side and you put the interest rate on the other side and if one thing goes up the other one's going to go down so you just keep that in mind so you\nAnd they have in the right kind of product or to help balance out the risk against the safety that idea nudey would be the safe component that is correct but a lot of times what the advisors are doing is that they have their clients' money in the market\nAnd they sold clients pay annuity variable annuity just to generate additional revenues for their from other company\nAnd it's a it's a revenue approach it wasn't a holistic approach to planning\nAnd so that's one side of it right so let's talk about the the kind of annuities that we feel good about can we like and those are called fixed annuities\nRight now fixed or nudity is not going to make you rich if you think you're buying a fixed annuity because you're going to end up with doubling your money five years it ain't happening\nRight now I'm looking at a guaranteed right of return and how right that is right in in the idea behind that was really used to you know the new to the fixed ... are designed not to make you rich but it's actually design\nFrom keeping you from becoming poor right and so within a fixed annuity a family\nThey have one called indexed\nSo it's got fixed indexed annuity and the fix component means that your principal is not going to go down\nAnd index so everybody's heard about index funds would index funds students mimic the stock market the U.S and the five hundred the Dow Jones industrial average or you could have been asked to actually get a Russell one thousand two thousand three thousand I mean she was going right there's a whole list of things you could index and so forth\nSo these annuities actually have where your rate of return on your fix nudity\nIs linked\nTo the performance of an index and you're not going to make as much money as the index and you'll never make as much money as the index but what happens is that when indices go down\nYour money doesn't go down so if you take say I'm just using it as an example that a hundred thousand dollars in let's say you make five thousand dollars in interest on that now that hundred and five thousand dollars with the fixed annuity\nBecomes part of your principal meaning it's locked in it doesn't ever go backwards stock market goes down fifty percent guess what you get a big fat zero for returns\nInstill it the one oh five now still at one of five right in the markets come up that one of five will go up to whatever\nThe next you know growth numbers for any luck itself but you know the thing is\nThat you give up some of the upside gain to have what's very important which is downside protection because the bombs don't do that the stocks don't do that the mutual funds to undo that exchange traded funds don't do it and the variable annuities don't do that the real life you know the actual value of your portfolio\nWill go down and most of this all almost all of those products\nExcept for the\nFixed annuity that peace of mind offering protection of your nest egg right and so if you just joined us you know we just talked about variable annuities and read what's called a new day in the house are so few ... and you have

than at Boris financial dot com that for the I think next year oh our a financial dot com or the number to call you have questions that senator things even talking about today Ninety\nRate cheesecake eighty two fifty five that's Ninety rate sex talk\nAnd they tell me a little bit about risk management how do we now if we have the right amount of risk\nSo for starters you know when we talk about his rule of one hundred so some people have heard it and you know we talked about this on the show in the past but if you took one hundred\nAnd if you subtract your age from that so assuming that let's say somebody sixty years of age right so you subtract sixty from one hundred answers forty and what that means is a forty percent\nOf your investment portfolios should be associated with risk\nAnd sixty percent of your money should be somewhere safe and you know we talked earlier that you know people have the false sense of security when they own bonds or you know even they own variable annuities that have income riders and things of that nature\nAnd those things I consider those false sense of security because we were looking for is what is your real dollar war\nNot an income writer but real dollar and\nSoon this case where we talked about is if you were to take sixty percent of your uh investment or you know sixty percent of your account value and that should be somewhere safe\nAnd you know you could put that in CDs money market accounts but what do they pay today do you know now that is well almost nothing nothing right it almost so what happens there is if it even if you have one percent does matter but the thing is that you're going broke\nVery safely and you don't realize that you would go broke right because your money's not keeping up with inflation\nSo you need your money working to or at least keeps up with inflation that means you're seeing even Stephen but we're we're focusing on his actually growing it a little bit more than that so that you always have the growth factors associated with it especially\nAs your expenses go up you actually do better than in places where I could because as your expenses go up your best hope caustic cetera if most people don't realize but their pension you know people were thinking that far ahead but they you know oh they're so worried about retiring and\nHaving enough money when they retire they don't realize that the cost of living adjustments like you were you when you were working and you got to two percent pay increase or for three or four whatever or some of the sort of you listening gold\nMine for has given me a raise in five years you know because I mean there are some people that just a you know aren't structured that way\nBut most most times when people are working\nTheir cost of living adjustment or as a as their income goes up every single year\nBut what happens in this case is that most pensions\nDo not have it cost of living adjustments so today you know the milk like we talked about in the past were laughing about um you were on the show but we had talked about you are when I first started driving\nYou know gas prices were like eighty nine cents a gallon and I remember that you do write of flew under a hundred dollar hundred dollar right and so by the time I actually graduated high school\nOr the prices have actually gone up over like dollar Thirteen or so and you're you know what I mean today if you look at it it's you know whatever the price of love to have those kind of gas prices right [laughter] yeah that'd be fun [laughter] but that was inflation right and today I just just ordinary were just talking to a client of ours\nAnd they ended up buying a new vehicle and I asked him I said would you pay for the vehicle and and they told me the number and I said do you realize that your parents first house will cost less\nThan what you pay for your vehicle today right and they're like that is so true you know that is so true and so you know we're looking for understanding how the inflation is going to impact", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "27"}
