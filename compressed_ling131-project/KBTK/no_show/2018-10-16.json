sure what's up\nSo my wife and I are relocating for our job we currently live in Grand forks removing the Fargo and um when we sell our home will have roughly fifty thousand dollars inequity after he paid ... and we're wondering what they would do would you put the fifty grand down on the new home or\nPay off something dumb that we did and that is a thirty one thousand dollar car loan and ... so\nI Would sell the car [laughter] you\nBuild a car okay [laughter] [laughter] I thought that's what you might say\nI'm okay what's your house all into\nA one hundred and about a hundred and sixty five thousand\nOkay so let me let me let me kind of walk into the equation when they're so clearly okay\nLet's say that we pay off the car with this money and then loses twenty thousand dollar split down our house and if you allow the exact same house you were talking about buying earlier um essentially you have financed your car on your home mortgage would you agree with that\nYou are correct\nAnd um that would take a dumb car purchase and make it even worse\nOkay\nThat's where that's how I got there so quickly because okay basically we're financing a Cornell over Fifteen Years which I'm not going to ever obviously what ... what I refinance my house in order to buy a thirty thousand dollar car\nNot a million years [laughter] you know and it's basically the same equation were just saying it in different ways as we continue in our conversation here and sometimes if you just look at it through a different different stand over on the other side of it and look at it from the left rather than from the right you see oh my God that really is done you know and so it's not as\nIt's not as a you know it's not just Dave says sell the car it's do you really want to finance this car over Fifteen\nWe are with those guys they were getting welcome\nWelcome ... Indiana alright welcome to Nashville and all the way here to do a debt free screen Oh yes I Love it how much of you to pay it off\nSo we paid off a hundred and forty two thousand five hundred dollars and twenty eight months\nGood for you and your range of income during that two and a half years we started out about Ninety thousand and ended in about a hundred and forty five thousand wow great what I'll do for a living\nOn a physical therapist and a I'm a engineering assistant at a local electric utility company very cool well congratulations gosh so what kind of that was the one hundred and forty thousand dollars\nWell answer this question because all of it was mine yeah unfortunately I'd Fifteen five and a vehicle and then a hundred and twenty seven thousand to that old Sallie Mae that wow\nHow long have you guys been married three years three years and so shortly after marriage the two of you look at this pile of debt and something happened tell me what about your story\nWell we were just kind of doing a normal thing ... um we were actually started out on the the ten year forgiveness program and I actually heard you come across the radio um I was driving around in my work ... ... and uh just was always interested in finances but really never knew\nUm where to start or where to begin and we picked up on your program and within a few weeks I purchased a total moneymaker ever read the book I talk or and I said we got to get on this I said we're doing it all wrong or or no and we started it out and uh she just kind of followed my lead on it a while which is like that yeah yeah\nIt was it was I mean she's a follower and she\nWas really I have some leadership [laughter]\nShe she didn't read the book really at all um and then eventually\nAfter I don't know about a year into the program she was starting to get mad at me because of the the program and everything I said\nWe just need to um instead of yelling at me we need to go see financial peace and then you can hear it from the source right from Dave ... and and you can email it takes on my back exactly to\nYell at the video guy [laughter] yeah very cool okay so you got in there then and you saw it for yourself rather than just going oh the engineer knows the numbers you know because I kind of how it started right yeah the engineer guy he's going to do the numbers I'm the\nMedical personnel let him do the numbers and then you get in there and you see it for yourself so what happened when you went to the clash coordinator gave you a emotional ownership really in this thing\nHere I think it made it very tangible for me something that I can see and that the leaders of our class they were very open about their debt and how they had read it and that was something motivating for me for me it felt like it was this constant uphill battle around and I had this crazy burning\nAbout their debt and how they had read it and that was something motivating for me\nFor me it felt like it was this constant uphill battle and on and I had this crazy burden because it was on line yeah it's a little bit of a guilt trip yeah lately and so that class honestly made me feel a little more support it and just give us

capital gains also aren't capital gains tax much lower than earned income\nOr that is not considered earn income it is considered investment income\nAnd it depends on what the money's invested in as to whether it'll be capital tax capital gains rate or tax on an ordinary income right if the investment is paying off on something that is less than a year old it will be an ordinary income if it's coming out of a traditional i._r._a. or it's never yet been taxed\nIt'll be on an ordinary income if it's coming out of a four O. one K. traditional not raw it will be taxed at ordinary income as it comes out\nAll of the money will be a hundred percent not just the returns because none of it the growth has never been taxed nor the money you put in has never been to act on a traditional so you'll pay ordinary income on those\nIf you have investments simply invested in the piece of real estate you don't pay any taxes until your salad and then you pay taxes on capital gains portion you own

at that job just ate me alive you know I'm not really hit my self confidence bad\nAnd so I was drunk for six months I and I was working\nUs staying sober just enough to work and I come home and get drunk as isolating myself from my family and my office a sleeping in my office and that\nAre really hampered my relationship with my wife and my kids and uh you know so by the time I saw this

McGuire um go to my pod cast and listen to gene McGuire\nHe was wrongly accused spent thirty four years in jail in prison um and ah his attitude a and his story of redemption and also a sobriety is remarkable\nUm and then also you might find it useful I did an interview with Louis house or from the school of greatness a few weeks ago\nA and that kind of goes into things are a little more I was operating on about three hours sleep when I did that interview and I listen to it and I went oh dear God what am I doing [laughter] ah so there's a there's very Frank on that one or you might want to you I Want to listen to those to me and one more favor\nYou have your wife called me\nIf you fall off the wagon just sort of just for a little just in this and when we can we can we can chat on the air and then you know maybe that would provide a little incentive for you\nFor you not to my wife my wife told me if I ever drink she'll leave me and I believe her a and that that that does cross my mind I Believe even if you don't start drinking she may\nShe you know she's getting up to the point now where it's like I'm going to start drinking or I'm going to be [laughter] ah but ah but best of luck to you will when you least expect it\nExpected a if you just remember that that your mind will knows you better than than you think and it will play all kinds of games with you you will make it

know I Want to spend some time maybe on tomorrow's show I Want to spend some time about this I'm getting so much\nMale now on\nPeople who are trying to go through recovery but more importantly I'm getting a lot of mail\nAbout depression and I'm a and suicide yeah and I don't know why this is happening but suicide is a huge spike\nAnd I don't think people understand it a and I want to share some of the things that I have seen in the mail and some of the things that I've heard I don't know if you saw a star is born\nI'd I'm not no it's Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga yeah it has to be a an Oscar contenders\nAll I think they're both gonna win Oscars they should it's it's it's fantastic um but it is um\nI don't want to I don't wreck anything but uh it um it deals with alcoholism uh and and suicide and it's a it's a very powerful and his portrayal of that\nAnd um\nI don't know suicide is in our is in this guy's\nRight now um and uh\nSo we'll we'll talk about it possibly tomorrow you mentioned you signed a book or for a for him and the book of course it did to the outrage we talked about about twenty five million times in the past couple of months you may know that it is available in bookstores however we want one thing we don't mention often is subtitled\nAnd you know it's about how treating the country right ... ... and then meeting that we have a problem not like us but like the country as a as a whole as a whole has an issue with the way they're dealing with problems\nUm and if you if you look at that because it's about what do I don't have it in front of me so yeah it's a um a house thinking like a recovering addict can help you heal the country yeah I mean it it does the principles that are helping him get through that alcoholism right\n... ... a lot of those same principles would work at a on our country no they definitely would and I ... you know you get into some of the ... addiction issues in the book but also how that applies to everything we have to deal with an entity that basically ... you know once a cure for Michael I have an ... like this is that's what the book it's about\nRight it's about being able to apply apply those and they weren't supposed to be the other situation\nIt starts at the ... and it starts at the beginning it's not just admitting you have a problem that we all have a problem that the nation has a problem and I think we can all admit that\nUm but it really it really\nIt just got a I think there's a section in here that in the book that really came before as an alcoholic I had to decide\nIs life worth living\nAnd\nIn the book there's a chapter of are we good or are we bad is this republic is the American experiment\nWorth saving\nAnd we're not talking about that we're seeing people tear it down but nobody who's talking about is it worth saving so how do we answer that question and the book goes through that and I I think the road to recovery of\nOf our ills in this nation start there\nYou know you you can say Hillary Clinton can say well I Can't compromise with people you know I Can't even talk to those people because they want to destroy everything I Believe in what what is that you believe in\nAnd and really believe in don't tell me the trait little things tell me about America\nTell me who you are no she can't do that because I don't I I just don't think that she's a she's honest enough\nTo tell me she's she's a politician sees a calculating and and so are most politicians right and left it's up to us we have to say that to our neighbors that we think we disagree with can we just can we not talk about politics we're second\nIs America worth saving\nIt a good place or a bad place and the book shows you how to have that conversation and gives you some some facts both on good and bad\nBecause both sides have to have to step to the plate both sides Republicans generally see rah rah all the good things red white and blue and were patriotic because we believe and we don't want to hear the bad things because usually the bad things are being told to us by people who have the country\nWe have to go out and learn the bad things about the country and those people who just know the bad things about the country you have to go and honestly look for the good things\nBecause\nI don't know about you but I'm both good and bad and my struggle every day is to be more good than bad to be a little better than I was yesterday and if I let myself go I'll be a bad guy well we've let herself go we're not trying to balance that anymore\nOccur from the Ninety seven point one

paying the pill now you can call ticks email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cell phone\nSo this is now they implement how many places did you get this finely up and running around the country I don't think you're explaining detail enough here explain exactly what the service does and how this can be implemented for every American\nSure there's over a thousand doctors doing the direct care model across the country and\nIt's a flat membership rate based on age it's insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits office visits ... free tele medicine's so you can call text email your doctor we have no co pays for anything any procedure we can do in the office is free of charge\nStitches biopsies joined injections ultrasound heart monitors lung monitors and then wholesale medications and labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out and let their doctors know that this is a better way to get health care and they supported and and that's why I think we've seen this gross so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist in say a big city like New York city\nYou know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\nThat it's working everyone but I think you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between you know\nThe former correct I mean we want to go down there to try to tick down the path of socialized total government controlled health care you know at a time where people are able to choose their health care decisions based upon their individual DNA we're going to take a one size fits all approach to health care it doesn't make any sense and you\nKnow Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump any more than Republicans walk their healthcare chosen diagnose Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so you know why are we inserting the politicians into health care with it that the government control health care system when you can have a better way through rhetoric primary care relationship\nWhere did not leave this was the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more\nAnd you get far inferior care because it never really was about the patient really was always about\nRedistribution of wealth and you know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth in America you have the top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income one percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners\nPay Ninety seven percent so what they've tried to do is ... ... for example they forced the young and generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans\nThat they didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan when they would have been better off paying for one check up a year right out of their own pocket\nAnd also getting a catastrophic plan if God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer or at a young age which rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr amber\nThis is a one size fits non model hum it's too expensive for young healthy people and it doesn't provide the service that older adults need in an affordable timely way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always tried to ensure everything but now we're to the point of ensure\nMedicines that cost a penny a pill I can get a thousand hardcore thighs I'd a blood pressure medicine for four dollars and Ninety cents\nSo the big box retailers will show you Ninety pills for ten dollars is highway robbery we can do cancer or for for six dollars a month in some cases the fact is now we just need less insurance that means health insurance is can compete on quality and\nAnd lower their price just like your Fifteen minutes we'll say Fifteen Percent on car insurance we need to get back to a competitive model or the patients are in control and cares affordable and insurance is just for the big stuff but the rare stuff\nAnd where are you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do their the innovators in this upfront pricing lower cost the government meddling aren't all that is true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know for example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would that would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nOr health care of local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear as the calorie is not coming from Washington to say\nNow if we wait for solutions from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get your fix this problem themselves and that's exactly what this loop and the movement does is it eliminates\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our fish\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but it's it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the health care after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh I'm productively as gross the probably one of the defining issues that cause people make people think the Democrats are actually going to help them and that's not\nA we appreciate your time eight hundred nine four one shown as a toll free telephone number if you want to be a

Want to follow up with this then we're going to get into last night's one and only debate\nAt least that that's the only one that's scheduled and that's the only one that's happened a this far and really got a couple of weeks before ah November sixth in the end of this election so will soon this is the only debate between Christians cinema and I'm Martha mix Sally so we'll get into that as well\nBut here's a curse in cinema here's a montage of some of the things she said in the past\nHalfway sanitary co pay a laboratory democracy and then my Arizona had fairly and\n[noise]\nYeah [noise]\nAnd I have that line someone they read it but I'm happy I feel it\nI think quite heavily Arizona\nComing with being young [laughter]\nYears we're\nHour police they put their lives on the line to keep our community safe in Kingston cinema voted against protecting our police opposing avail to increase penalties for criminals who violently assaulted police officer they protect us let's sit on the debt to protect them cinema also\nVoted against increasing penalties from the gang members and violent criminals involved and drive by shootings and send them a defense sanctuary cities that stop local police from working with\nFederal law enforcement to deport criminal illegal immigrants the sanctuary cities lead dogs go rather than health kick\nThem out of the country protecting criminal illegal immigrants instead of deporting them\nKingston cinema handcuffs are police and put their lives in danger it's radical and it's wrong reject Kingston cinema imagine the damage she do in the U.S Senate\n... and the pain tone is responsible for the content of this advertising is not a candidate to many dozens and dozens and resented that or\nSeven was the big cocker local issues local talk that just for that show\n[noise]\nEarly ballots have made it so we have a Muslim election I mean it used to be you're going to vote one day November ... make your decision and it's over with um I don't know it's just it's ridiculous I don't you think it's got ridiculous to law at George cannot sat orbital dot com yes he's awesome this [noise] oh yeah\nOh yeah and and I mean and and campaigning obviously isn't in full swing because again election day we expect about Fifteen or ... percent of the total vote to come in and the next seven days imagine that and then another Fifteen the week after another Fifteen the week after we're talking about election half over before election day even half\nYeah and as a candidate they have a hard time um how do you run those kinds of campaigns while the governor on tomorrow a congresswoman Martha McSally is going to be on tomorrow now you've done some polling data and George scale infused with data orbital dot com he is he's a great blog that you can follow because you can follow this election stuff it's not just for\nYou know politicians you can actually follow this stuff that George puts out there but you did a survey poll but she waited it right talk about that waiting\nYeah yeah absolutely and that's the critical thing that I Want to make sure one that's still sending understand is that we wait at the numbers there we're going to talk about right now in a scenario that represents what other presidents are calling a democratic surge okay this is the Democratic turnout an extremely high numbers\nWhat does it look like that's what this poll is predicting this pull it not predicting rainbows and sunshine for Republicans us POWs not predicting what usually happens in the mid term election and the state like Arizona is assuming a democratic surge\nIs upon us and that's what we called the Republican ballot advantage the percentage um differential between how many Republicans show up and how many Democrats show up usually it's Thirteen percent mid term elections or has it at five percent so very generous to this quote unquote democratic surge\nSo it's kind of them some mystical blue wave it's the blue if you're assuming as the blue raise\nMy numbers are trying to reflect in show the public because of the criticisms always given out\nA tiny pollster which is all you're not accurately predict team is going to show up and so we actually released numbers the true sense right we'll release democratic surge numbers and re released expected numbers but I wanted to show [noise] observers that even in a scenario of a democratic surge\nThere that you know it still is what it is and again you know we can talk about those numbers today to show that Governor DC are still going to be reelected by our latest poll even in a democratic surge scenario and here's why we wanted to kind of\nRemove all doubt for folks when they're looking at these numbers and helping them look both scenarios their outcome\nYeah and when I was when I found interesting George last time we we spoke and looking at other polls that other organizations have put out\nA few weeks ago I was like well the governor's five to seven points ahead and governor juicy has done a tremendous job with the economy and you've seen all kinds of things happening in the state of Arizona so I was surprised but now looking at the poll that you recently did what are the number showing you\nSo right now we have the governor actually had a sixteen percent\nAdvantage and there's two absolutely critical reasons why he is leading his Democratic opponent by sixteen percent and by the way for listeners to know it's fifty one percent for governor DC so buck fifty percent fifty one percent produce the thirty five percent Garcia here's the too big factors the governor is winning about Fifteen Percent of Democrats\nBack realized what you just said the economy is going well Arizona is on the right track\nJobs are increasing lowest unemployment in years more money in their in their pocket more money for education\nRight so the ... percent of Democrats are crossing party lines according to our latest poll and voting for governor DC\nAnd independents are are are giving him a slight favor and so when you add that all up Fifteen Percent of Democrats winning with independent on obviously\nI'm you know not allowing Garcia to get more than four percent of Republicans that will meet the governor to have a sixteen percent advantage even in a world where there are more Democrat and I've ever voted in Arizona before\nStill doesn't do it okay and then secretary of state's race another pretty heated race obviously the primary uh see again or took out to the incumbent Republican\nUh and then you have a Katie Hobbs who boat I've had both a dinner believing I I've been both a democratic and Republican on George I'm On this race um course he wasn't supposed to come on yesterday he's rescheduled who maybe next week so we'll see but what is shown on the secretary of state's race\nSo we're trying this one little tighter and I think that it's only to do with the fact that that either gain and our hearts are obviously the incumbents won this race you actually have gainer\nAt forty percent and we have harms that thirty two percent so again or stills within a lead but both are under fifty and there's about twenty five percent of people undecided so this race I think and you'll notice by the way that shortly around the time of his poll a Tom's fire it was reported he donated\nTwo and a half million dollars to the Democratic party or not to spend on Garcia not to spend on January ... who's running for attorney general to spend on ... and so the Democratic party and ... and ... century made it clear from their pocketbooks\nThat look we don't think they're Garcia can win and so they're trying to put all their eggs in this box but again even in this race Republicans did gain are still has a an eight percent advantage with obviously twenty five percent of people undecided and a lot of time left as we just noted earlier forms of uh early voting\nYeah a lot of time left than any other races we'll see if there's a Republican sweep for the statewide offices um I've seen some other polling data the closest races the superintendent public construction or ... Frank reaches within the margin of error so um that race was a close race in two thousand four teams\nUh George Cullen is with me with data orbital dot com George once you next a survey of coming out I Will have on congresswoman with Sally tomorrow name which Sally cinema races being watched by everyone in the nation really a wonder next survey on that that that has been neck and neck everything I've seen for a while now\nYeah yeah absolutely it's been neck and neck and we've had some stuff that I'm maybe world a little bit more of us in mystic from a colleague but we're also seeing things obviously with what was released today that was a much more optimistic permits guy I think it's somewhere in between I think most on the degree that it is neck and neck\nOf the next sort of set a statewide service that we're going to release most like go out and next we want to try to track\nThe book um early voting days because again polling is a snapshot in time as everyone who's listening knows and so as people vote those snapshots on him even more critical because they're literally taking a snapshot of the mind that those ... percent of people that voted so we'll be doing some\nUh probably weekly releases starting next week through election day on some of these ... races to allow people to get a flavor for\nWe're we're going and we also will be adjusting the model if we determine uh with what you alluded to earlier and and the extensive early vote tracker that we're putting together and by the way of making public\nOr for anyone and everyone to ah to participate in them to follow along if we're looking looking like Republicans actually are going to have a much higher about advantage are much lower will make sure that that's reflected in the polling so that we can all does he stay current with what's actually happening on the ground\nOrion folks go to ... dot com you can track that George I think we'll be talking again before election day\nAbsolutely All right we'll always appreciate your time have a good one like\nAll right folks um I Do want to welcome to the program was sunk some moral election stuff uh was Kelly ... Fox News contributor um she's also with the orange the Republican National committee Kelly how're you doing today\nHow good not a Fox News contributor just often on Fox I in my heart attack but a great deal I now\nWell thanks for thanks for coming on today now you know you were a George Jones we've been talking about these races and uh uh you know we're in a in Arizona here we're watching the mix Sally cinema race um what's your take on a you've talked a lot about kind of a forgotten demographic um and that's our veterans\n\nThat's right and that is our veteran then you know a dollar in the we've put 'em\nOn than tons of money millions actually at you or veteran I and you are\nProving to our veterans that we're at the party that take care of their needs and backed out during the Trump Administration\nTwelve major pieces of legislation I've been at that President Trump signed for our veterans that today at pretty explicit you came out in the New Yorker not merely a Republican or New York magazine rather not merely a Republican publication they're\nAnd my in Studio guest live here in Flagstaff is a nother candidate and this one is for governor this is he's the Democrat nominee or for the office of governor David Garcia\nIs up here for an event it needs to stop by the studio to talk with us about why he's running for governor\nGet into some of the issues as well so if you have thoughts comments questions or lines open after this segment and then the entire four o'clock hour eight seven seven\nNinety seven one three Ninety seven one eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one I'm also this week I Will have on senator Sylvie Allen\nThis is interesting because she is one of the state\nA wide officeholders or or you know one of the elected folks\nWho is being targeted by dire as California\nThe proposition one twenty seven organizations decided to go after certain races attorney general Bernard rich\nBeing one of them and senator Sylvie Allen\nBeing another so she's got to talk about why um but I Want to talk a little more about prop one twenty seven I Know you've got your ballots or maybe you're going to the polls there's still a lot of things to decide on so Lindy Smith with the ah no on one twenty seven group um she explains it better than anybody [noise]\nA lot of people don't know the background on this down that long story short it's funded by California billionaire over in San Francisco he's trying to turn to Arizona and California um he's funny in about thirty million dollars in the state of Arizona to turn out um college students and millennials against this proposition when he's not telling you is that\nBecause ... generating station will have to close under this proposition natural gas plants will actually be ...\nMany more carbon emissions not less making our air actually dirtier\nUh your one hundred I read I mean he's funding the funded the vast majority of this Ninety nine for so I don't know what the numbers now but it was a huge percentage get this on the ballot absolutely yeah and so where are we going to get our electricity from because or energy from I mean it sounds nice sounds great I mean do you want\nClean air for Arizona I think we all do we all want that of course and that was unfortunate about this proposition because it really is a political play like I said Tom ... thirty million dollars in other states to push this initiative and essentially it's going to mandate as you guys probably all know that our power utilities public utilities adopt\nFifty percent of their power from a noble energy now this is almost only including solar and wind it doesn't make room for nuclear which right now\nOur nuclear facility actually produce a fifty percent of abs it's our end that's fifty for thank clean energy if they would have included nuclear and that's an issue that we already what it meant by goal were arguing with art in the nation actually for solar producing power too so we are a leader in that we're moving in that direction this is not the right way to push forward\nThe Palo Verde nuclear power plant provides that base is kind of like the engine that's always home yet\nAnd that's led to catch a century but the so the people that are pushing proposition one twenty seven forward the people that are saying yes say that you know this isn't gonna close Halliburton and I'll tell you by the wrong so like um you know just said this is a base load facility which means he can't turn it on and off\nOn so when they come in with solar we're not going to be able to or abs ...\nEconomically be able to run a palace Verde at full capacity twenty four hours a day three hundred and sixty five days a year which means that wind saying they'll have to build natural gas plants and the plays because that is the only type of force they can get that they'll be able to turn on and off to supplement when solar power isn't you know sufficient enough\nAnd that that's happened and they this model is based on California's model right you remember this was their they're having trouble over in California\nRight and I don't know if you've heard these sorts but they had not a solar power works rate when a lot of sun was coming down everything's happy spin on it how it's so good that they have to dump their electricity might think oh we got so much electricity were you know we can just stored or something no it doesn't work do you know about this do they have to send it out\nYet they do have to send it out on you know it's funny about this too is that California and Tom fire keep talking about how the you know leaders in solar energy whatnot\nWell they're not telling you is back in two thousand Fifteen when they implemented a very similar proposition to one twenty seven cents then their utility rates of actually increase it three times the national average down for the people over there a pain for this it's not just some you know happy go lucky clean energy source on the beneficiary I'm Sorry to say is actually ... he's getting that money\nWhen you're in they're actually paying to give us a lectures yep I'm voting for those folks actually paying the Californians we had to take their electricity because there were a cook the system basically that's my unscientific a word for it but we had to take electricity and they paid us to take it Lindsey how ... how much is this going to cost I mean is it passed\nYeah unfortunately it's hard to say 'cause the numbers seem to just keep increasing so essentially a bottom line this is going to stand to double your utility rates every month on that's going to happen because with the closing in Palo Verde um you know utilities off to build natural gas plants in addition they got up to build\nAll these solar farms obviously the big utility companies are not going to bear the burden of that cost is going to come right down on the rate payers that's us that's can be the W. um also speaking of ... very I'm fifty five million dollars and property taxes is what they pay every year a lot of it going actually to the public school system\nUm with this proposition that will closed down that fifty five million dollars will be gone as long as about the three thousand jobs I think that yes employs probably already will be gone\nWell and I don't understand how how long would you because this is by twenty thirty hip so it would have to you'd have to get fifty percent of your electricity from renewable resources by twenty thirty which seems so far off but it's less than twelve years off yeah unfortunately how did your up how do you give up for a quick\nThat I mean I money and uh I guess effort by on it I think that's going to be the problem with the utilities are going to have to face is that that's going to be a hard number to reach 'em and unfortunately in order to compensate for that they're going to have to be paying a lot of money which means we're going to have to be paying a lot of money\nI Wonder what it takes and I I really am do a lot of ... Smith is here with me as well um I really do need to get folks from a PS on\n'em and they actually asked me if I wanted to go do a tour of the poll averting nuclear power plant or they do those and I take ... yeah maybe I'll do that I don't know um but I Wonder what it takes us with me and my question to them I'm throwing this out there and wonder what it takes to kind of gear down a nuclear power plant your what happens to it it's like\nWhere does it all go away and I don't just like how the huge process when an expensive process yeah yeah it would have to be very expensive so you have this huge facility there\nAnd it would you do with it after if you're just going to shut it down yeah I'm so this one's scares me a lot a Lindsay and folks are talking with Lindsey Smith because I think we're trying to build them economy in Arizona that's a resilient\nAnd we have an economy that's growing up I mean look look where we were just a few years ago a and you can look at the nation right now that it's really read about it and doing well um but what does this do to businesses what would this do to businesses and the average person out there who probably works for a small business well\nThat's the unfortunate part about this right 'cause that's we all know its utility prices increase the price of everything else because even if you don't even if you're not service ADS\nStill you know maybe the the business down the road is or what nine as they tell you prices increase they're gonna have to pay for that somehow that's going to come out of our pockets as consumers\nSo that means you know less money going into our small businesses that employ those in our community means less money to those on a fixed income and less money into our school system actually which is just so funny that this is being pushed by such a big Democrat after such a big movement to get more money into the school system when this is a kind of do the exact opposite of that\nYeah hey let me ask you this have you seen a lot of chatter you are very attuned to social media and what's going on there um there's been a lot of charter on prop one twenty six were charged with the failed serve a sales tax but what about one twenty seven\nBecause sometimes on social media and you're seeing different ... you know on may I see a lot of support for which the ... because it sounds so good that if you don't look at the unintended consequences and and how this will impact people\nYou you really don't know what's going to be on on those and so people say oh that sounds good as I said when ... well that that's why a kind of opened up with Lindsay with you know why didn't hit the earth [laughter] because that's what they kind of a sure bet hated that with\nThe paint it that way and honestly they're doing a really good job with that unfortunately like I said before with the money that's coming in from Tom Steyer he's targeting a lot of on you know college students and people my generation I'm twenty four I think his ads everywhere on Facebook and I mean they sound really good right I mean I wouldn't clean environment to live in but again they're leaving out so many bad information\nArizona I think when universally agreed that working toward um you know renewable energy good solar energy is a good idea but the way they're doing this is very dangerous because it is\nYou know this but the ... any proposition that starts with a one is an adjustment ... Arizona constitution okay that's what this is a mandate and our constitution\nThat are public utilities have to service lists and as a conservative I'm fundamentally against that idea I mean most conservatives are that's why I think we see a lot of pushback from the conservatives but unfortunately some of the younger generation or the people that are just seeing the Facebook ads aren't seeing that kind of underlying method\nYeah and I've seen that argument because I've we've found that argument on not to mix proposition but one twenty six I don't want to ban put in a classroom like well I don't want a tax for the masters\nThis would so this would be an amendment to the constitution proposition one twenty seven and ... then you have to do to change it would be tough\nBut I've had this problem with this initiative for fraud since its inception and I've spoken with corporation commissioners on it um who are in office now and who are running for office on Justin Austin who's running Rodney Glassman was on recently and is running a of course Austin's on their um\nAt staples and storming and celebrity any team restrictions applying cease to associate or staples dot com slash twenty by pretty tales [noise]\nTaking ... percent off when you find a new one hundred dollars for an extra twenty percent off when you spend a hundred dollars or\nDollars for\nBetween for twenty to come\nNinety seven going and them being maybe ... village Flagstaff Prescott bugs news on the [noise]\n[noise]\nIn defense of Saudi Arabia ...

seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one here with David Garcia David running for\nGovernor of Arizona and\nWe were talking about education we could probably talk hours on that David before we got that we're talking all fair about innate you and I didn't get to finish my sentence all of a sudden I realized are gone back on air\nI'm I'm starting to bring this up to basically everyone who comes to running for office who's in office\nI'm left to right center I'm folks are starting to question the growth of northern Arizona university it's a big topic up here\nAnd it used to be just a little whisper in the wind but now it's like wait a second we want to get to thirty or the Arizona border agents wants to get the thirty three thousand or so and a lot of folks like wait a second worst city of Seventy thousand people\nUm so it is a concern that I like to bring attention to a folks like yourself what do you what do you think about those ... ... what are you hearing out there\nWell I hear it all the time I hear it all the time when I'm In Flagstaff with respect to growth and in a you know I can tell you Jeff we'll just get budgeting down to a a quick second for your listeners to understand\nUsed to work at the legislature and the legislature cuts in the areas where there's an additional revenue source to his new schools because parents will go out and pass local bonds and override yep\nYou cut at the university level or why because you can because can tuition can be raised cities and towns get cut by the way well and it puts the squeeze on cities and towns to back so\nWhat the state has cut at the university level we have had a if not uh the the some of the highest cuts in pay a higher education of any state\nOr ... to to stick I saw was on an average day to day to cut about sixteen percent since the great recession and we're at over fifty percent statewide and to make that up what the universities have been forced to do with bringing numbers\nAnd not just local numbers by the way numbers from folks from young people out of state who end up ultimately I can in some ways supplementing the tuition of our local Arizona stay there because they pay more for\nLike a lot of times I come from California it's cheaper to go out of state\nBut they but they still pay more in so it's really a numbers game I think it makes sense for some universities look I'm a local control guy we're just having a conversation about philosophy you know under means you're going to find more local control then I think you see on the Republicans today\nBecause I Believe that local control where local ideas are best ideas are best at the local level I think they make more sense you get more buying more sustainable\nAnd I believe that a model of growth growth growth may not fit for all of our state university it makes some sense for issue because it's in the fourth largest city in in the country and there's very little higher education options down there but it may not make sense for any you for example or for you of aid to follow and growth model\nAnd don't get me wrong ... Garcia is my guest folks um I'm a big supporter of any you had lots of family go there it's a huge economic uh input for the community or something like one in six jobs in Flagstaff or northern Arizona I Love any you but it's people like myself are starting to question that\nThat number that ultimate growth number and we're like oh man we can't even get down Milton avenue right now um I and I look at a bar or things like that I don't know if they're talking to folks like me and other folks in this community who are like and and the president of any you were like wait a second hang on time out\nAnd and I'd love to have that conversation so you're you're you're into into you're aware of it obviously so okay yeah\nNo question in like I said you know I Believe this is my my same philosophy by the way for cities and towns\nSo this way David Garcia responded yes true according to ... dot com July eleventh twenty eight which tax increase they act crazy\nBut which was like sell you know David what he's referring to as a sales tax I'm Mark or or did you have something more specific there that he can at least reply to\nAll I'd like to require hadn't reply to all according to ... and the thing is in favor of state tax increases\nOkay thank you for that call appreciate what taxes in general I talked about a little bit earlier or your stance on taxes property taxes are income taxes sales taxes I mean I think everybody agrees there needs to be some sort of funding mechanism for we all do it for the government is the level of and where it's coming from is the argument\nSure well I'm not certain a villain BC moves article that as being a reference to here but look we as a state must invest in the services that matter and it starts with public education\nAbout half of the state budget not quite but almost half the state budget is public education\nAnd I believe we need to make sure we're funding public school not just because it's a constitutional obligation but because it's a great pathway to economic development for Arizona if you look at the one area where Arizona can vast and change the trajectory of this state\nIt is in the best thing in education so that we have the high quality workforce that can bring in the types of high quality jobs that are paid well in Arizona and can build our economy\nDo you worry and we see a lot of things going wrong in California at least from my opinion do you worry though that the you make the taxes too high um and you get a situation like California where businesses are fleeing to other states Arizona Texas Utah cetera\nOr do you worry about that tax the amount that the citizens can take and well obviously\nYou want to have that concern you want to make sure that your tax structure fits your local a local area and you're in your state but states do this very very differently if you look at western states they all have different kinds of tax structures depending on their economic model depending on what natural resources they have available to them\nI think we need to make do we need to look it would make sense for Arizona\nA historically we've put a lot on sales tax for example\nAnd because of that we're in a situation where we boom and bust uh with the economy because the sales tax and now we have done that we've been in the cycle for very long time in Arizona the question is do we want to do something different so that we can put ourselves in a more stable situation here in Arizona\nA and that way we have a bit more diversity with respect to how we're paying for crucial services that I think Arizona's are looking for\nBut in addition this is also about changing local tax structures and economies as well you know uh I recognize that most of the development happening in Arizona is actually happening in Maricopa County not\nHappening up in the in this area not happening in northern Arizona\nAnd investments and things like community colleges are a great way to build local economies up here in Navajo Nation for example moving from the novel generating station to adjust transition to solar or another ah energy source would make a lot of sense and education central to getting that done\nWhat about against that you brought up in our generation I mean there's that looks like in his closing they've tried a a big percentage of their their budget lp budget ... budget it's a big percentage um what do you do how do they replace it there because they have all that coal up there what did they do well starting\nWhen we look I think the key here for Navajo and for for for hope he used to be on the front end of the economy and that economy is solar in Arizona\nWere one of the funniest if not the funniest stays in the in the country solar is a many many proposals up there to transition to solar and I believe that use in a in a situation where you using a particular community colleges to train\nIn the implementation and
