T. Fairfax, Virginia the great WMA out go\nA Mark I'm really thrilled to be on the air with you uh my name is Jason do it all and my father was a conservative Republican or us representative from going to California for Eighteen years\nAnd I remember his name\nYet or the corrupt media Democrats under Nancy Pelosi\nAs well as the corrupt leadership of the Justice Department I work very hard for me and my father and our family but it it had to fight hard for eight years in bend over a million dollars in legal fees\nRemind me what happened\nWell they were my dad was in the Republican leadership and they were friendly with\nJackie Vermont and just by a guilt by association they are Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats tried to tried to take my dad my family down but unfortunately or fortunately accuse me after eight years or putting them severely financially in debt or my parents were able to weather the storm and and come out victorious\nWhere their charges brought against them\nNot a single indictment there were eight years of investigation or put them a million dollars a day to spend a million dollars just defending themselves my\nDad can you imagine being investigated for eight years\n... years that the FBI they'll have to turn some of the personal effects\nAre they took my family so that whole cabinet the tuition very much to um to me because I Believe they've tried to do the same thing to this good man at that time with my father the good news is my dad weather the storm even though my parents were ruined financially they didn't fold under the pressure to admit to something they didn't do and thankfully neither is cabinet\nOr the real reason I'm calling because I never third one bit of our politics I certainly never considered myself a conservative but the aftermath of the two thousand six election that changed everything for me\nBelieve it or not I was planning on voting for Hillary I Know that sounds crazy but I I was basing that decision purely on how I Believe\nShe presented herself on TV during the three\nTelevised debate I thought that she represented herself more presidential a but a stupid that found I'm sure there's a lot of other people who did the same thing a Democrats are very good at looking polish on television they\nHave a great outer belt with no substance underneath a but it was it was after the election right started to realize how crooked one side of the media was\nAnd it was this that started the wheel burning in my head\nI'm been seeing all the venomous attacks by liberal on social media to force myself and others are for during the out of a different opinion which that's what really energized me to get in fights\nAre allowed to serve and a Republican through and through and I absolutely be voting Republican in the upcoming election I've got I'm asking there there's other people more like me out there people who didn't say much about politics before the election\nOf people are starting to have their eyes open to what is happening in our our all ready to get into the fight at this point I really believe this is the fight ...\nFight versus good versus evil you know Republicans stand for freedom in the constitution versus Democrats represent hate and are working hard to take away our individual God given liberties\nNow my friend but I think you're exactly right and my best to your family I'm Sorry you had to go through that you take care of yourself [noise] M. J. Fort\nLauderdale Florida series satellite go right ahead please\n... ... and how you doing this evening rate thank you\nFight for like you know first and foremost um my ... I just turned fourteen just finished reading liberty and tyranny and ... and he is working on 'em sit America healthy yeah there is a tough book and married Tokyo proudly now he's ... we could cut in between ... ...\nWriting a report on it um yeah but I Am I and I just first one and I love your show on Sundays off her it's great and I'm just wanted to say thanks for everything you do I have a bad heart but you can you keep the company\nOh my goodness [laughter]\nAnd so looking for this book coming out my husband's a cop so I I Can't wait to this particular that's great I wanted to ask you a question you were just talking about um people you know with the left loving women and supporting women and all that good stuff\nAnd I don't think I'm Dr for its lawyers really care about her care about women because I thought um I just kind of thought with general on a former marine so I just got along with um General Flynn lying to the FBI maybe or didn't lie to the FBI not short\nKind of thought he was maybe getting in trouble going to jail and I thought with Martha Stewart maybe not inside of training but I'm going to maybe going to jail for lady lying to the FBI um\nIf if the left cares about her including the Democrats in all these people I mean it says right here Christine Ford's attorney said they haven't heard from an FBI cabin I investigate Asian why would they want the FBI to ask her one question\nIf the FBI ask one question just something like hey do you fly on airplanes she's done she only jail\nBut none of them but here's here's the thing is that the FBI right now I agree\nWith you but they're not doing a criminal investigation\nBut this is what judge Apollo tunnel doesn't understand or many other people all they're doing this is not a criminal investigation where people you know plead the fifth and that sort of saying what it is is they're trying to ask people about the various allegations that were made and that's it\nRight now I thought on your title Eighteen\n... title Eighteen is a big title you mean a section a thousand and one false statements yes\nYeah I mean that's that that's possible but again they're not doing a criminal investigation they're doing a background investigation of people have different opinions and so forth there doing a criminal investigation they would have to be issue in letters they would have to go through a completely different formalized process\nOr then they're going through now if they want to do search they'd get warrants probable cause it's none of that my only\nUnderstand that that's what they want because obviously they wanted rats would watch terms\nThey don't care about the client is what I'm saying because they want to think of course the honor to drag it out but they don't care about the victim is what I was getting at\nWe know what they want but they don't want this they don't want to know which ones so happy for him but I'm so happy for what's going on but I mean I Am just discuss it that we know they don't want Kavanaugh but for them to stay one justice for the victim they get that if they drag this out\nNow that the the the way as if you want justice for the victim you go into the Montgomery County police department and you make a complaint and see where that goes and they won't do it All right I'm Jay do get your point I Hope you feel well a given your week hard I Know that feeling I've got one myself but you hang in there\nLet us go to Steve Los Angeles California eight Seventy the answer camera leg or at a\nMarked first of all thank you for all that you do you and your partner in crime or Sean Hannity I don't know what we would do without you know you kind of touched on what I was going to bring up\nAnd maybe I Need a little more understanding common sense would dictate that they don't need the FBI does not need to talk to the judge or Dr Ford or why not for the sake of appearance and\n... not about appearances they had a limited amount of time listen appearance is not is not going to assuage the left it's just not\nIn so we on the right we have to start to understand this or we constitutional is it's not about 'em or pacify the media pacify the Democrats don't you understand they want to destroy what we believe in ...\nAnd so we can do twenty five FBI investigations unless there's one where they can hang our hat on it's not going to matter\nThis is these are the same people who said the man is guilty as a job interview and that in the ... and the and the the uh\nUh the due process doesn't apply because it's a job interview does anybody really think that if it looks better if the FBI interview the two others that somehow you'll bring over Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer is a bomb thrower\nThat's what we're up against

to the face you know kind of found out this week this last weekend so pretty pretty tough to follow\nMm So she was hiding it from you\nYeah I'm ... and I you know I Can't just blame her I mean I I got to take some credit because I never kind of went and looked kind of a\nPaid any attention and miss is the second time so about two and a half years ago kind of the same thing and I kind of laid out a budget and then kind of slipped away from that budget and I think it was it just kind of roll back into it I filmed everything was going okay but it just kind of wasn't\nOkay so you gave her a all of\nThe responsibility of handling the money and you weren't involved in the money\nA hundred percent okay yeah yeah is your fault yeah yeah um\nAnd it's her fault or but basically she was out of control didn't know what to do and uh just borrowed her way\nInto a mess and neither one of you had your head and the game correct okay\nSo ah are you already to stop the cycle\nI can show you how\nA hundred percent and as a this this week and so there's a lot more\nTo the the problem with that kind of a solution but a on Wednesday this week I got a I've received at twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance check that I haven't put in the bank yet because I wanted to wait until I spoke with you to see how I or go attack us I don't want to\nI don't want to do any other dumb things I Want to continue I Want to start from scratch off the debt but I got to do the right way\nOkay well let me ask you this them um it sounds like you're taking ownership for having kind of a dump this on your wife and abandon her\nOr is she taking ownership for the shame the\nFact she was ashamed and so she hid this from you because she didn't know what to do but she knew she was screwing it up\nCall is a very interesting topic this topic of financial infidelity read but magazine to the service and thirty eight percent of you lie to your spouse about money [noise]\nWow\nAnd you wonder why your marriage wasn't topping out is an awesome now I mean it can be a little white lies\nWas under the bed Snickers snake or write or or it can be big time credit card debt\nIt can be one of you is running a business and is running up debt down at the business and not telling your spouse\nBecause you're trying to live your dream is turning into a nightmare let me just kinda clarified this for you there is no positive effect to your marriage when you lie to your spouse\n[laughter] was\nThat helpful you don't already know that did you [laughter] well I'm trying to avoid it by ear you're all you're doing the cooking it up is going to be a bigger fight once it cooks up [laughter] you might as well have a smaller fires quickly [laughter] so here's the thing if you're afraid\nTo discuss with your spouse a purchase or a financial issues that you want to discuss that is not a financial problem that's a relationship problem\n\nNow I got to tell you there's times I I mean I I have a ton of money I'm a multi millionaires times though I think I Want to buy something and I'm going to sit down and talk churn hey I Want to buy this toy I Want to buy another gun she's like you don't mean not again you have too many guns already people already would think you were crazy if they know what I mean and you and I collect guns by the way so\nYeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're going to find out that I was like one of those crazy guys or something I'm not but I I collect okay I collect so you know you don't need another car you don't need another ... you don't need another inner tube ripple behind the bar actually collect those who've got too much too many like toys right ah for the grandkids and for the kids to play on\nAnd so you know I I get ready to buy a toy and it's it's not it doesn't even show up on our\nBut I still have to have this moment and I go I I actually got to make sure I talked to share in about this she gets ready to buy purses too expensive which is one of the few things that she buys is too expensive\nBut like she says one of those purses is equal to\nOne of those guns [laughter] ah well maybe maybe two guns [laughter] but uh you know and it's funny how as adults that have the money even\nWhere there is a lot of stress on the finances have it a little bit of a dread about talking to each other so you really have to push yourself and make yourself and Rachel talks about this in her book love your life not there's one of the seven habits just talk about money even when it's hard and it's almost always\nHard to talk about it keep it clean and if\nYour spouse is hiding money from you it generally does fall under one of three areas one is you've got a broken relationship and they are intimidated by you\nTo the spouse is an arrogant rebellious immature\nPrints are princes that just wants to do whatever they want to do with their lips stuck out and they don't like being told no spoiled child and the grownup body\nAnd goes and buys whatever they want to buy but know that it's wrong so they hide it\nFrom you\nMost often we find hidden that though is the what the guy was on the last call one of the spouses has been given all of the responsibility all of the weight of all of the decision making isn't doing the money handling well ends up running into debt because they're not doing a good job with it and\nNow the shame is multiplied and it shame based hiding its guilty condemnation base hiding so they're hiding it 'cause they don't they're they're ashamed that they haven't done a good job handling the money\nIn which case if that's your spouse you you are partially responsible just like that guy said he was he on that because he should have\nBeen more involved you shouldn't have dumped this on his wife and you shouldn't dump it all on your husband\n\nYou shouldn't dump it all on either one of you both of you should be involved now whenever you again can carry that ministry of weight once all the decisions are made but every body ought to know where every dollar is going\nPretty simple stuff so you probably never heard the story but I actually was the guy who has almost been on Oprah more than anybody\nOprah called like five six times their producers did and would tease us like we could get on I've been on every other show back in the day you know I've been on a sixty minutes I had been

there ... except I couldn't get on Oprah and they would call and teases so finally they call and we get our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them in their trouble on Oprah and the very first family\nOf course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into a sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with Oprah\nWhy would I Do that because Oprah was wrong\n[laughter]\nIs what happened so here's the deal the wife had run up like Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea\nAnd uh I had told the producers as it was partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not loving his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars if she unless she's just like a psychopath and her level of deception\nThis guy hadn't got he he doesn't know what's going on under his own roof he's freaking clueless when his relationship\nAnd so Oprah's reading the script and she's like and Dave you say that it's partially his fault and he owes earn a biology I don't think I agree with that and I said well you would be wrong he does or an apology cause he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand all over the debt and he don't even know what the blips going on under his own roof\nAnd she's like well he delegated to her I said oh this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you're delegated in business you would always inspect what you expect you'd never just walk away and hold it happened you would know what's going on in business and besides that this is marriage is not a joint venture God did not say and now you are a joint venture you\nSit and now you are one and these two are not one they're not on the same page and so\nYou know the poor lady sitting there crying because she's so ashamed and overwhelmed and the guys angry 'cause he's finding out he got eighty grand and death that he didn't know he hadn't oh man it looked like a Jerry ... Springer episode or something and uh you know and I'm a I'm standing on making him apologized to her for not being a good husband\nBecause if your wife can run up your husband can run up a hundred thousand dollars in debt and you have no idea what's going on you have chosen to not be involved in your own spouse's life or their or psychopathic\nLiar one of the two but most of the time it's you just did you just dump it on them\nAnd then and then you Cripe 'cause they didn't do it right after you dumped it on them and walked away in close your eyes and what we'll do blue ... well you know you thought but you didn't even care enough to\nIn what was going on and so\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know when you decide to get smart with your money is kind of like God look down and said hey I can trust that one and you know I think that's something that kind of happened with with us 'cause you know a lot of different opportunities started coming our way in terms of just income and and of course a lot of increases came our way as well\nAnd so God just begin opening those doors and we were able to pay off with a much quicker a lot quicker than we thought because like Virginia even mentioned in the beginning it was definitely very overwhelming and just looking at all the student loans you thought how are you going to pay this off\nAre going to get home do all these different things for the family but um you know definitely go with our side and and of course you know he was able to open up those doors for us to get on the same page and be able to\nPay off this in a pretty good for\nYou know how how do you explain to other people will cause I Know I Know what the answer is but how do you explain to other people the level of intensity that just requires because you guys I mean it was not panic but you were focused\nTo the point that you sacrifice so deeply that normal people looking at you all have the thank you lost your mind I mean you guys were you were game all\nYeah where do you get that fire from was it desperation\n[laughter] yeah I think it was a ... mostly that living with a student loan was unacceptable for us and and we just had made the decision and our heart that um we weren't going to do that and so\nI had and we had just individuals that kind of had the perspective that and living with a student loan was and you know and it was normal you know it was just a meaty offer the and like that was just a part of life\nAnd certainly made is going to be a room mate for life\nWhy why why do people you know are some responses that we got where like you know you don't need to do that or you know that you could fit into your life that we had just\nMade the decision like you know art student loan which just astronomical that we couldn't live with it and so and we weren't really we were ready and willing to do and told to do that zero budget you know the Xerox and budget everything out and every dollar hadn't assignment and every extra dollar went to a student loan so we were making payments\nLike in the stands there and making payments to have a ... a month\nRight we have to have a big shovel and so we put everything we had towards the end we had like zero last for like just everyday living like eating out\nGoing shopping and socializing entertainment like that did not meet our budget line item and not for our budget and so and you know the sacrifice was overwhelming and they can to anything like it was really a marathon to the degree that it was extremely painful to live to two years like and that lifestyle you know\nBut and I would have to say like during those times like\nPrayer was everything like I really had to say I really had to praise through and just the ... of that type of lifestyle and really be uplifted in

Henry clout I read it many many years ago and since then Henry and I had become really good friends I Love Henry I love that book too and one of the things I grass from reading that book and other books\nIs this there is a difference between forgiveness and reconciliation\nThose of us that are wise in emotional maturity spiritual maturity\nAnd those of us that are Christians are called to forgive when you forgive you set yourself free\nFrom the bondage of the fence you're offended and when you forgive when you're a victim and you forgive you're not setting the victim eyes are free you're setting you yourself free\nYou can forgive someone and not be reconciled to them\nYoung lady called a minute ago and was\nTrying to figure out how to should she reconnect with a brother in law she's having trouble reconnecting or brother in law after he had affairs and everything else and he supposedly come clean for the last two years\nHis wife has forgiven him and taking him back and been reconciled to him but not the sister in law she didn't won't be around it\nSo here's the question at what point for someone's misdeeds do you forgive them and then at what point are you reconciled to them they're different\nGood\nSomeone rapes you hold on [noise]\nGrotesque violent unbelievably violent crime\nI Can't imagine can't imagine going say something like that\nBut to not forgive them of eventually as you begin to heal from your emotional scars\nIs to not set yourself free from that very difficult to do I'm not saying it's easy but when you look when you do forgive them you set them free but you would not be reconciled ever\nTo someone who rage meaning you wouldn't go on a date with them you know someone steals your wallet you can forgive them\nBut you're not gonna you know leave your wallet with them later your new wallet for them to watch over your money you wouldn't be reconciled with them\nProbably ever in that situation one of the case of that young woman she was not personally wrong her\nYou know the guy's wife is who was wrong right and uh her sister in law was wrong or brother in law I don't know how it worked and his brother in law but\nAnyway as is loving it I guess her husband's family\nIs well understood it but anyway the the lady that the the wife is who was wrong to she forgave animals reconciled to the husband as he supposedly just putting his life\nBack together I don't I mean everybody's life back together I don't know the guy you don't know the guy well once you do that you can always do it well you know people that I haven't done it can always do it\nYou know\nAny one of you listening is capable of adulterous affairs\n\nEveryone's capable of that and if you think you're not capable of it you're just about to have one I mean really that's just ridiculous so at what point do you forgive someone when they've done something wrong at a distance\nLike that\nI can forgive him and you know I Hope he's turned it around and I'm not going to sit around and ring my hands and be mad at him and worried about him\nI Hope he's turned it around I Hope he doesn't hurt her again on his wife\nI'm I can I can do that now at what point am I going to trust this guy again that is what reconciliation is at what point am I going to trust that his conversion his turnaround is real\nSee we run into this all the time with her coaching because one spouse lies to the other one about money what we call financial infidelity\nYour husband your wife lied to you and ran up a bunch of credit cards and you didn't even know it it's hard to trust them again after that\nIf you're going to stay married you're pretty well instantaneously\nGonna have to sit down and go okay I forgive you but I'm not necessarily going to be reconciled to you financially\nI'm a I'm going to watch over your shoulder on everything that's going on or we have a couple of come in and the guy is a ... as I you know he's a been found to be a gambling addict which happens like every week\n\nFootball betting is destroying families from the answers on be leave all\nSo he comes in he discovered she's discovered he's a abetting addict an online betting addict the gambling addict and now he's gotten treatment he's in gamblers anonymous and he's seeing his pastor and he's seeing a a counselor and he's doing everything he supposed to do does that mean she just turns over the checkbook to him and let them go run havoc again no\nNo it's a matter of fact we recommend that when someone's recovering from an addiction like that that that they not have control of their not have any access to money for a while\nUntil trust us rebuild overtime but ten years later ... should be rebuilt ten months later it shouldn't be better than it is now two years later or should we better than that it should progressively rebuild trust\nAnd so if ten years later you you're still or you know you you have not bet on a football game again you've not lost any money gambling again are you trustworthy at that point yeah as much as anybody else's and so we're not gonna treat you like you have no\nAbility to handle money the rest of your life but for the short term yeah we're taking all access to money away from you too you prove that you can have a little bit\nAbsolutely but then gradually trust is rebuilt and overtime is rebuilt\nIf you cannot when someone has\n... on something like we're talking about here ... ... ... has not when when someone has demonstrated over an extended period of time that they're not\nEntering into the negative behavior and you can't forgive them and you can't begin to trust them in that area then it starts to be on you and two years clean if the guy's clean\nFrom his double life adult for survivors or whatever he was doing on addiction whatever it was sound like it was all of that\nTwo years is a long time you should be some level of trust rebuilt assuming it's all real now if there's indicators is not real if they're still looks like he's sneaking around if he's still got behaviors that make everybody question whether there's a real then that's different but I'm assuming\nThis cash right and if he's straight for two years than you know it starts to be your\nProblem if you can't begin to trust at that point especially given that his wife already she might just be an enabler she might be\nShe might be ... and that could be what's going on how\nCould be\nThat he's cleaned up his life and you're just suffered you can't forgive the that's the difference there's a difference in forgiveness and reconciliation they generally happen at different times and generally forgiveness should come faster than reconciliation\nOf our pet a dog and it provides me forgive the dog [noise]\nWhen I got to be reconciled with [noise]\nThis is the Ramsey [noise]\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity\nAnd pay for a plan to do the budget due this year ... budget do the baby sat and do it in order to don't don't become a genius on your own ... and then he um you got to execute it doesn't

what these different cultures\nExpect from the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the ... are in Ecuador and you know they really do believe that at night they're consciousness leaves the body when they're dreaming and that\nThey are having direct contact with the spirit world so they go out and they get information and then they come back and in the morning when they wake up\nOr it's like if we were to read the newspaper in the morning and see what happened in the world while we were sleeping they use their dreams to help navigate what they're going to do in the course of the day I and so it's like a pre cognitive experience and the whole culture built around that\nI think that's pretty extraordinary um they also make use of plant medicines to Iowa ask for example or\nSomething that they use for big visions so if they want to anticipate what the whole group should do Twenty years from now they'll use the ... in a collective ritual and that includes little kids you know seniors everybody in the whole sort of community participate\nThese experiences make you more aware of the possibility of God or does it take you you have a way\n[noise] I guess it's a matter of definition how do we define God I think that the idea that there is something beyond this limited awareness this and kept slated mind body that connects us to other mind bodies a suggest something vast\nAnd I also think you know people who are able to access these non ordinary states have consciousness\nExperience depths of reality that aren't part of our mundane everyday experience and that's you know pretty mind altering\nWe are are going to get to do a lot of different aspects are really the supernatural spiritual reincarnation and things like you've got some great stories about reincarnation of the books that you roll back in two thousand Fifteen just makes life possible told me about that title again how did you\nShip with Deepak Chopra for a film we made a\nFeature length documentary by that title and he was the one that I was giving a lecture at one of his workshops and I was showing a little video that I had done with some of the scientists who are working in this area of you know after death reincarnation\nAnd he pulled me aside after I was done is like\nMarilyn let's make a movie and I thought well I wouldn't want to make a movie with Deepak Chopra and then I went to bed at night and I woke up the next morning completely petrified you know the whole idea of having to fundraise and all the rest of it and\nSo at lunch I think Tim very profusely and explains that I really wasn't going to be able to do it and he said oh Marilyn stop worrying about the money the money will come\nAnd I'd like to say it was just that easy but uh we did accomplish something that now has been all over the world translated into multiple languages and\nAired on Oprah about two years ago so it's been out there and making 'em an impact with people who are struggling our goal in both the film and the book was to help transform that fear that people have into an inspiration for really living well\nI mean I always tell people I'm not in a hurry to leave\nBut I'm not scared if we have to do it\nRight and we will eventually all of the world that's a whole interesting thing to in terms of the future science you know we see now that all this cloning is happening they've just cloned um eggs that can be fertilized to turn into humans in a petri dish it's crazy\nAmazing it's it's truly spectacular\nYou learn how to download memory\nAnd preserve it on a chip watch and then call new body and then put your memory into the body\nWe live forever yeah that may be how we get life on Mars or future beyond that is that it's going to come with\nYou know some kind of genetic manipulation and cloning and you know it may not be that this physical body goes out into space but that it's generations later through these kind of scientific interventions that we start to see the future of humanity\nWhat'd you say to people Maryland who say hogwash\nLife after death does not continue when we die ... ... what do you send them\n[noise] [noise] well I'm very respectful that people have various different perspectives different world views and my inclination is to think that what we really believe is probably what we're going to end up and\nAh so those people who believe in reincarnation may well reincarnate and those people who believe and sort of the Buddhist journey of enlightenment um may end up through in a\nYou know maybe in a black hole somewhere you know alternating at the\nThe threshold of some event horizon I mean I think all of those things that seemed completely farfetched in the past are\nNow something that we can really start to grapple with when I made the film I interviewed a Michael ... who is\nHe's the governor used the skeptic\nThe well known skeptic he's also you know a really smart guy very interesting\nAnd and I use a nice guy\nYeah I Would say so and I had a really great time interviewing him and what was fascinating there were two things first of all I he acknowledged that when his mom died he heard her voice\nAnd I ... you know with a little surprised that he was telling me this on film and I said well really lets you know go back to that and he said oh well you know it was really nothing but yeah I heard her voice\nAnd I thought well that's an interesting acknowledge Mitt and he had a good psychological justification that was just some kind of hitting the gods ...

with a preliminary study but it showed that when people evaluated\nThe statement made by the medium as having been accurate or correct\nThat the ... the memory center of the brain kind of cleared out it was as though the brains of these mediums we're creating a space for another set of memories to come in I find that extremely provocative and interesting so yeah I think there's\nThere's all kinds

think that's extremely interesting I don't know and the answer to the question are we evolving toward a higher consciousness or\nAre we evolving toward greater levels of complexity and technology but are more allergy and our ethics haven't really changed that much I've been watching\nA show on the ... cheese and we know that you know they were catalytic to the time of the renaissance and promoting our ten language and science but at the same time there was enormous corruption and you know people poisoning other people to get them out of the way or\nYou know really creating false narratives about people talk about false news\nUm fake news you know it's been happening and I think people have managed their\nInability to resolve different points of view through violence and I'm not seeing right now that there's a whole lot of\nAlternative higher level um meaning centered altruistic kinds of principles that are certainly being communicated in the popular media by our political leaders I'm just not seeing a lot of\nUh references to a hopeful message for our own evolution toward something higher if we want to use that metaphor and it doesn't mean I'm not helpful because I also see that there is tremendous good in the world and often times we just need to shine a light on that\nI think eventually good beach over evil don't you\nI sure hope so I mean I think if we have an option

going to be fine you know I'm just not sure that that's really where the story goes\nI think each of us in our life can make choices and do we want to ah grab hold of our highest potential do we want to develop our social and emotional intelligence you know those things take effort and if not people can just\nResort back to these kind of base impulses that come from the amid the law and the fight or flight and we don't really get that prefrontal cortex involved in a way that allows us to make wise decisions\nAre one of the things we see about aging and talking to Alice was that ah we know as people grow older or there is this concern that we lose memory but\nAt the same time we gain wisdom\nSo it's as though we get these ... that help us to manage our lives better and so that's one of the hopeful things at least in terms of our own life development is as we grow older we may lose some of the detail but will gain greater insight\nRight let's go to first time caller Michael driving in Ohio\nAnd there and he launched okay thanks\nI just wanted to call because I had this story that I have that uh\nI was listening to Marilyn and I normally listen to get all night and they'll ever have anything to say you know I don't have any stories of my own but this one you got one while I was a kid I was hit by a truck when I was riding my bicycle\nAnd I didn't die or anything you know I didn't like have a near death experience that I remember getting hit by the truck\nI remember hitting the ground and then the next memory I have after that is the sky looking up at the sky but then I looked down and I can see a circle of people around me laying on the ground\nAnd I was just wondering if that's like something you've ever heard of before like it's not a near death experience but it's definitely an out of body experience\nI live in Maryland you had something like that\nYeah that sounds very similar to my experience and again I think what's helpful in\nTelling each other these stories is that it helps us to remember our own ... instances of this and yeah that sounds like a very\nA predictable kind of near death out of body type experiencing it suggests that consciousness

not drunk when he accepted the invitation to\nModerate the debate about whether or not he should have done it was the question later on what on earth was I thinking and that a couple of laughs came out of that\nBut the fact that he put himself in that position and then the criticism that has come for some of the things that he said that you know one way or another they don't seem to be life shaking a but it's not what you expect from him\nAnd so that's a but his whole reputation has been jarred and that's the point I'm making year by his appearance\nAt this political event and whether that was you know seriously but not a huge deal as been blowing up into a huge deal yeah and now are acting his life and yeah and his personality forever yeah right anyway\nA that's a an aside so meanwhile back in the ranch\nOr the other the the the Facebook hacking how many people have worried Victoria cue and you're good at this stuff from Victoria joins I'd like to have you jumping on this as well Facebook but was fifty million\nPeople ... accounts were compromised yet again are and what in the name of God is going on there\nAnd why is with all of these questions I Know the numbers have gone down on Facebook but they don't seem to be going down appreciably and one wonders why because they seem to be very well have just gotten too sure of themselves what is going on there\nWell as in terms of numbers one of the reasons why Facebook's numbers have they've definitely dropped off\nBut in the older demographic they have not because that's for two reasons one older people don't know how to disconnect and delete an account on Facebook and that's actually I'm not making a joke that is a very real thing\nAnd the second thing is for a lot of older people that is still their lifeline of communication with family across the country or around the world and so those numbers of the older generation are always going to be there on Facebook but for a lot of younger people they've just you know pulled the plug\nAnd and you just keep hearing these stories time and time again that they've been hacked and security isn't good\nAnd you know and again going back to the older generation using Facebook they probably still using password one so they're even\nMore vulnerable and they don't even realize that they don't change their passwords he never change it\nRight you have to change your passwords\nOn a regular basis but you know get get my mom to try to she's not even on Facebook but if she was to get her to change your password you know it's all I've got the sheet we're right on my password around and you know it's just it's never going to happen so unfortunately\nThere are a lot in the leading tolerate hair on air with Doug Jennings Victoria outlier Ninety seven forty one you know I can talk because this is going to be that and\nWe live with forever yeah and it just it is it's got to be something that we have to learn how to deal with and the way you deal with it you change your password and your right your user name or at least a couple of times a year\nYeah can I can I also said something very creepy about Facebook which is that they've asked people to use to expect to identification and I'm In\nOregon id number and your finger some British I mean\nYou log in on the computer and then you get a text to your phone yeah and you and then you say yes\nThis is me on your phone and then I computer says okay you can get in so is that good or bad retiree good\nWell in theory in theory it's good but\nWhat Facebook has done is that uh they have been ousted and court for settling the phone numbers\nThat were being used for two facts to\nIn other words to make people feel more secure to advertise it\nYeah there are a bunch of the that they really really really they did it has to be able to get to ...\nThat right I I mean I I'm Still on Facebook because I like to see occasionally will my nephews that do it I don't use Facebook anymore I I Am so\nDon

um\nI just think quite frankly I just didn't call after that I just don't do it I was just on 'em but what's going on here I mean you have everybody knows this is going to be you've been in politics for a little while I was in the city council and and you always know when you put out a position you're the uninsured guy men forty seven others\nAre or forty eight are like no I I'm good I'm voting for Kavanaugh\nAnd three are the unsure once they got to know they've been in this long enough Collins and Murkowski route that they're going to get clobbered then there's gonna be protests like their words that front and center flakes office in Phoenix yesterday um why do they do this what what where do you think sort of like going to be our our senator from Arizona\nWell here's the deal or you you mentioned it earlier is that you have to be a hundred percent with these people or otherwise are never your friend so Murkowski and and and a flake a and cones these people are not ever going to be your friends I mean look John McCain looked at the experiment called John McCain\nYou know when he ran for president he was shredded by the progress is by the Democrats or doesn't it yet but once he dies ... he he was a thorn in the Republican ... he he's a stand up kind of guy\nBut they're never going to be your friend\nSo if you're thinking about one winning an election or running for an election you need your base\nAnd so you better make that make them happy and you better make the constitution happy and you better make sure that the rule of law is is held but that standard and we've been going two hundred and forty years and it's been a success story\nBut we're person who's right we're we're we're turning a corner yeah I agree to go left me to go right we could stay the strongest place in the world but if we don't have the rule of law it didn't take very long before those lights are out yet rule of law over rule of\nMan somebody just deciding yep this is this what we're doing today yeah that's why we have that piece of paper now seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety someone here with Congressman Paul ghosts are\nA lot of folks want to change it on I've seen it here in northern Arizona um sometimes I Wonder you know my listeners who are in other cities in in Prescott and and very valley in wherever\nI talk about ... because when I see the stuff happening here that we see and the other big cities to San Francisco's of New York's but there there's been this push\nA to change the ... they want to change the constitution in particular they want to have the open border they won't people flooding over there's been this push we've got one councilmember here in Flagstaff are against women have put some shows up in the ...\nAnd I have the open border that they want people flooding over there's been this push we've got one councilmember here in Flagstaff a councilman have put several shows up in a meeting on a diet there with the sign that says a hash tag abolish ice [laughter] God David Garcia is running for governor now he's on that bandwagon as far as I Know as well\nThere's a lot of there's folks in that that\nAre in Congress oh yeah I'm sure Oh absolutely what's what's the plan here what I mean what are they thinking\nAnd also where are we in transition to the border where are we with our border where it was ...\nI I take a counter steps but obviously they don't care about the safety of the American people because ice intersects a\nTons of an illegal drug I got one of my pilot if there are no I mean right now what they've done with that no uh illegal sent along on the streets could kill hundreds of thousands in coastal a million people what's what they've confiscated\nAnd obviously they don't care about human trafficking and women trapping particularly women and children obviously they don't they don't care about that either because ISIS one of the premier interceptors of a a trafficking human human ... uh people\nThat's the problem is is once again it comes back to it as a person that I've I memorized and it was from Louis Brandeis who is an associate a Supreme Court justice a government of laws is imperiled if it doesn't hold the laws ... uphold the law scrupulously\n... if it doesn't it empowers every man to be a long break in and buy ... anarchy here's our sign I mean this is the ... you know a clip from the blue comedy tour Luther George Soros is pouring money in this country for the anarchy he won't say one world government\nSo I mean folks I mean this this is here right now in here\nAnd it has on our doorstep Z and evil prevails when good people do nothing that is the ...\nThat is the key scary times that's scary times and I think you're right around that corner is scary times but you know what I'm a our freedoms and liberties are not free we have to fight for them day in and day out\nUnless they give a little bit away we we will we will be hoping again a Ronald Reagan said that light on the on the hillside you don't get it back you don't get it but you don't get it back now I mean and so from that standpoint the other thing I offer is is we haven't turned yet we're going down the road there's less there is a right\nBut we do in this election will set us on a trajectory we're empowered as voters we are empowered as citizens to be well educated to be first if if you want the Soviet style\nGovernments is ... owns all low and you know if it does everything you'd be holding the government welcome to victimization because that's what the other side wants I'm not for that I Want people to be empowered when people in power they strive for great things they accomplished the impossible\nYeah and I was talking about just some of the things with the\n... it's time's up um we've got to stand our ground make sure that the facts are there and then debate those facts but stand our ground people want a fighter they don't have to always agreed with him and but they want a fighter\nAnd Jason great comment and he also mentioned you know he felt that this started under bronco bomb and now I I was not happy for eight years now but I just\nI'm not saying that there was never cases of people that got kooky and did things and you know what I'm saying but this level and and I I it drives me crazy when liberals argue that this is what happened under Obama no way right now but here's the facts\nSo under bronco bombing had fast and furious operation choke point where we went after the second amendment\nThat's the only way people can hold a government out of control accountable and then we saw in ... where there was a lack of accountability once again you're going to see a whole a entourage of things that break down the culture of this country\nWe knew was going to happen bailed intervene didn't let anybody intervene unless the crime scene to be contaminated\nThey near the IRS where oh my God you're guilty to prove yourself innocent the attack of the government against a citizen\nOh my lord\nThen you start seeing the attack on the press with James Rosen ...\nAnd ... this was the rivalry of breaking down civil society\nAnd you're seeing it right now with the ... a salacious in and verify dos hearing that's why we're so poignant about making sure that they weren't the me a similar to warrant are shown in full display to the American people to show how dangerous this is\nBecause you become a number if the government can give you everything they can also take it away yeah Joseph Stalin now I mean you don't have to go very far looking Venezuela going on right now\nThis is what you want that's not what I Want that's not what I Want my family that I wanted to have the opportunity\nGoing on right now this is what you want that's not what I Want that's not what I see what my family that I Want them to have the opportunity to move forward to make their lives better uh you don't have to win but you always have another chance I'd actually\nComes and goes I Know the problem though is\nThat what we have these educate books because they don't ... they don't remember that history I'm not saying I remember history from a hundred years ago but you read the history you know the history you know what I'm saying and they don't remember that history now when you were just saying all those things from the Obama administration has\nYou know it's like a ... a bad flashback asked me can absolutely forgot about a lot of those but then you start talking about the the horrors of past socialist regimes\nAnd now you see socialism cool you know you see that you see the statistics look young people this is Jay Jay I I Know\nThey have no clue what it is I Know you know it just something that's in bad\nAnd and and it's also tells you how sad our educational system is where we're tearing down our history well that's the first thing that Stalin did that Hitler did that now did you take away someone's history whether it's good or bad you learned from that we're human beings\nAnd when you look at the civil or you know a a monument from the civil war [noise] it doesn't have to be that they stood for something right but it's something that we rioted a long history history absolutely but once again\nYou've seen in the past\nAh regimes like mowing Hitler and insulin remove that history so people have nowhere to go back

to the program and I'm excited about the Senate if you've been talking about it all week or he is the chief nuclear officer at the Palo Verde plants Bob bee meant Bob welcome to the program how are you today are no good just new I'm doing great I'm\nYou know we've been talking so much about electricity in Arizona electricity in California I'm In particular the Palo Verde nuclear power plant and add a\nTon of questions for you and I'm Glad we're able to ah to finally connect and uh I I Hope I can keep up with you chief nuclear officer so I I Will try my best um but first off\nLet's talk about Palo Verde where it is or what it is you know kind of give us maybe this thirty thousand foot kind of history in view of what Palo Verde as a ... so\n... is one of the largest ... states of America and it's located fifty five miles uh west of downtown Phoenix\nThere's three fourteen hundred megawatt reactors out there so were produced about forty two hundred megawatts of power so we can power about four million houses across the southwest and we knew we do provide power to California Arizona New Mexico and El Paso Texas\nSo it's not just when we think of the great it's not just like hey Arizona you turn on Palo Verde and that electricity goes around here so it's it's\nA regional thing that is exactly correct and so uh so it was built in the eighties I'm In ... came on line in the in the late eighties [noise] ah we've generated more electricity for the last twenty six consecutive years than any other power plant in the U.S and we take great pride nuts and being part of Arizona\nFor a long\nWay from Lansing and kind\nOf\n\nMember or\nA rebel army or wherever\nThe\nCatholic at the turn of events Iran's right after I got Brad adviser they'll make jet bull riding friday and Saturday Night I got\nFive seven for both for ten dollars for a dollar for twelve and I\nHave no idea [noise]\nNow back to the gym for that show I Ninety seven point one big Tucker\nThat Jeff are they show\nCome back we're talking with the chief officer at the palace Verde\nPlant uh Bobby meant Bobby ... and you've been you've been at in this industry for a long time but\nUm I I mean this is how did you get involved is in first of all you you're in the ... are we broadcast from Flagstaff we cover all of northern Arizona uh but you come up to Flagstaff a lot I Do I Do so uh I'll start with\nUh my background nuclear power I joined the nuclear navy out of high school a as an enlisted electrician a served on board submarines for six years are providing the propulsion and the power for those those submarines\nThe strongest navy in the world in in uh in our technology or what was second to nobody\nI get to um to see other fleets up close and uh and we did a really really well against the fleet so that was enjoyable um and then in Nineteen eighty one I joined the commercial nuclear power business and so I've been generating clean energy since Nineteen eighty one using a nuclear fuel\nSomething I'm very proud of and in a you know today it's a big topic\nA bit for us in the nuclear business it's been a big topic for a long time and we're proud that we generate fifty six percent of the cleaner energy in this country\nIn Arizona we generate over Seventy percent of the cleaner energy that that we use in in this state so when people think about\nAbout clean air energy and and they get to look at the Grand Canyon and and the the beautiful sites we have across the state I take great pride and the fact that um the people who have a ... he had been generating electricity that helps them keep that claim\nAbout first of all thanks for your service and it takes us to go in a submarine and that close to a confined space I talked to his folksy for it and that's a that's incredible and into working out of a U.S a while as soon as a small nuclear reactor within that confined space\nAmazing stuff technology is absolutely amazing I bet you mentioned something that that caught my ear it's the ah nuclear energy you called a clean energy um because it it doesn't ... it's not like call\nA coal has\nLet's look at the nuclear power plant palate very\nIt has a lifespan still\nA a quite a long ways it's eighty years apart from from what it was built to correct that's correct okay so we can go out to twenty sixty seven ... for the units now uh we were talking during the break they call it a coal plant produces a ashtray and then not to mention a\nCertain other things that are in the atmosphere whatever\nUm what does a nuclear power plant produce in that eighty year span as far as waste is so in the eighty years than\nWe are going to create these canisters or we talked about about a football field full of them so if you think about eighty years generating forty two hundred megahertz every every day of the year except when the units are down\nAnd and we run the Ninety two percent capacity factor that's a lot of power out of a very small footprint and then we have the technology in technology is just going to continue to improve Jeff of how to how to ... re process that that fuel\nYou retrofit none of that plant was built in the eighties early eighties do you have to retrofit is just kind of still running on the same principles or has technology changed over time\nIs a really good question and I appreciate it um I think that the nuclear industry may be the strongest industry in the world at learning from the stakes\nEnforcing the industry to make changes Nuclear Regulatory commission is a very strong oversight of us from Washington DC\nUh but we also have the Institute a nuclear power operation which is a self governing drive towards excellence body or that evaluates every plants performance every two years so you you take the lessons learned from from different even smaller ... large events\nAnd uh we take those and make modifications to plant continues to be upgraded\nA will be digital some day you know we started all analog rentals we'll be all digital and as we move into new technology and and the solar comes in we want to be able to maneuver the plant\nUm during the day some because we want to have room to take that solar especially when California is going to take us to repay us to take the electricity we wanted to create room\nOr where that helps our rate payers get that electricity that comes with money\nBy folks Bob ... is my guest he's the chief nuclear officer Palo Verde plant um let's go let's go back to that because there's still some people they hear nuclear power and by the way thank you for your little on your safety guy here\nThey will put that up and talk with Jeff deck on cars safety's important it is safety is a huge factor some people think back to first of all three Mile Island ... that comes up um\nI you look at Chernobyl which I assume was horribly antiquated bad technology um but but are accidents very common I mean to talk about safety because that's a big concern with with the organization with Albert no I absolutely appreciate\nYou talking about because we talk about safety all the time um and uh and it's a focus from for us in just when we talked about safety we talked about industrial safety nuclear safety radiological safety and safety culture creating an environment where people can talk and raise raise questions and concerns in and have their voice heard\nAnd people appreciate the fact that they disagree ... and so ah that'd be great thing to spread across America at this time but we don't go into that ...\nThat but uh so we focus on safety and if you look at the margins that we started these plants up with back in the seventies and eighties to the margin we operate with today we increase the margin sometimes a hundred fold\nThese plants are so much safer than they were\nTo the margin we operate with today we increase the margin sometimes a hundred fold\nThese plants are so much safer than they were and if you think back as cars are built in the seventies compared to the cars that are built now\nPlanes seventies planes now there's no comparison to that technology to today's technology and so I feel [noise] I tell people you want to work at the safest place in Arizona ...\nMind justice if your numbers supported him even safer than TV and radio just a to point to own up to adjust us very dollars here and exactly a ... and so uh so we we take great pride in and be in a safe place to work in Arizona\nHow many a couple of questions here how many new because we're going to get to the electricity aspect of this year's soon but how many nuclear power plants are there in the U.S that's my first question when a hundred okay are there any being built now or plans to be built anytime soon or is this something that's getting harder and harder to do\nThis to being built a down by August of Georgia and the other so those those are president being built\nI Believe what you'll see a for the next wave is small modular reactors or the new technology and and which is implemented even more safety precautions\nSo I think that that's what you'll see a been built in the future in this country ... modular Missouri right what's the what's that mean well it means that it may be um for example or one of the ones that I'm On on the board for is a new skill reactors\nAnd are they build fifty megawatt modules and then they put twelve of them together uh for for about five hundred megawatts interesting and so uh so that that is where I think you're in this you are doing dumb [noise]\nJeff far that show Monday through friday at three PM a Ninety seven point one of the doctor [noise]\nLikes that various consistently ranked as the most expensive city to live in in all of Arizona\nNo surprise you are right and it's tough to find an affordable place to rent will listen up if you live in or a moving to the Flagstaff area checkout Flagstaff for lease dot com because they've got some great affordable rental options for you\nCheck out this deal at ... dot com a one bedroom one bathroom home for eight hundred and Ninety nine dollars and that includes utilities that's right one bed one bass eight hundred and Ninety nine dollars with utilities\nFlagstaff ... dot com also has two three and four bedroom homes as well as office space throughout the Flagstaff area so what are you waiting for go check out Flagstaff the number for lease dot com that's Flagstaff for lease dot com\nPlethora of papers behind this new as a constitutional amendment correct that's correct that also has as what I call very uh more much more stricter requirements for hydro there's a ton of stuff in there and folks in Arizona have to decide if they want to go to the strategy is from a\nA California billionaire has pushed this ah it was a similar plan if I'm correct that California has passed Dr ... so what's going on in California first I'll do they have nuclear power plants in California\nWell they started with a two nuclear plants so if with two units each one south Los Angeles and and one between Los Angeles and in San Francisco\nThe one south Los Angeles has been shut down okay one north or in between the two is going to be shut down and twenty forty F twenty twenty four and twenty twenty five I'm based on not having a place to put their electricity during the day\nAnd so in ... when you look at this proposition one twenty seven and and people say a it won't have an ... won't have an effect on Palo Verde I think that the record speaks for itself look at California because they put the fifty percent renewable standard in\nA early in a couple of things that have happened over there one their electricity costs have gone up three times that of the average increase across this this country of ours\nAnd the second is they're shutting down all their nuclear\nAnd so when people say it's not going to have a negative effect on ... the wrong\nAnd if the people that wrote the initiative cared about ... they could have put it in the ... but instead they wrote in at least two places this does not include nuclear they made a point of exotic\nCould have extra now this is the only I guess I should I should just early earlier this is the only nuclear power plant Arizona that is correct so they could have easily said except for the one plant that already exists there is there any plans to build any others in Ireland okay so that would have been pretty easy so it does proposition one twenty seven say that\nPlans to build any others in Arizona okay so that would have been pretty easy so it does proposition one twenty seven say that any existing nuclear Palo Verde 'cause it's the only one that has to be shut down or ... or the assumption is being made as to what's going on in California\nAs far as their closures\nSo I'll take the see neither one of the above a\nSo [laughter] but what what I Would tell you is is we have what happened in California but if you think about a Jeff so most of our renewables are going to come from solar\nAnd the the proposition says that fifty percent of our energy has to come from renewables over a year period\nSo if you think about that in our peak electricity uses in the evening when no soldier is available how much\nPower is going to be generated from solar during the day during the daytime it's gonna be a hundred percent ... you can't get to you can't get the fifty percent for the year without hitting a hundred percent so if you hit a hundred percent solar during the day in the summer\nIn the spring and fall when we have about half electricity use it's all going to be guaranteed solar\nSo where are you going for ... you can't store it you can't just say we're going to put it on the grid and the voltage go up and do breakers start trip and that's not alone\nSo what you're going to do is you have to shut poll a verdict in so people start talking about the economics and how what what the prices that we generate ...\nIt really doesn't make any difference because what is going to control this is the fact that California is still trying to sell us power during the day because they have too much\nWe're going to have too much so now we're not even be able to buy California's power and ... and ... and then on to the rate payers and we're going to have nowhere to send it transmission limits us going into New Mexico and to the north\nAnd something that um I found out about and we were talking about about California's initiative and their energy initiative eventually didn't want to get through a hundred percent from renewable resources track and that no\nSixty percent renewable okay hundred percent clean okay a hundred percent clean but nuclear will be probably off the table by that point I'm going to make that assumption you don't need to the nuclear it will be off the table by that point\nUm is there a provision in their law that allows them to buy from Arizona for example off ... do we sell ... cells over to California right now could they buy our nuclear power they could they kind of I guess they could buy it in their offshore going into ... basically out of their state and federal right out of my\nIn fact right now I have I have three owners over there and and uh so that they get\nThey get a percentage of our electricity all the time the SP one hundreds of California just passed specifically says that they can use nuclear\nUh for the forty percent of cleaner energy they can also use carbon capture a on fossil fuels so a change so you see California as they go farther down this\nThey're changing their their direction\nI'm not a hundred and eighty degrees but they are adjusting so you think about proposition one twenty seven and and this to the constitution that makes no sense to anybody I don't believe the fact that [noise] if you want to move forward\nOr you had a commissioner Tobin on a a few weeks ago and when he talks about eighty percent clean by twenty fifty\nThat's something that everybody can get in to discuss them how do we get there and is it is a totally eighty percent but the thing the commissioner Tobin a talks about is every four years we'll review the plant and\nLook at it and it just yeah and he includes nuclear you don't but you can adjust it whereas this constitutional amendment I'm your pigeonholed into this and it is it is mostly solar I guess when I'm ... but that that's\nThat's yeah far they show Monday through friday at three nights they have\nFace soccer [noise]\nFolks you've heard me talk about twilight janitorial you\nKnow that's why
