the media as a collective supports socialism that the media as a collective supports the abyss ration the United states military that the media as a collective supports the Democratic party\nThat the media as a collective supports activist judges\nThat the media as a collective supports the attack on American history\nWhat else do you take from this\nAnd they go on and on about freedom of the press like you and I are somehow threatening freedom of the press like Donald Trump is somehow threatening of the freedom of the press was John Adams\nAbout freedom of the press like you and I are

can seriously conclude that Don Lemon is any kind of journalist a reporter he's a buffoon nobody can seriously argue that Brian ... there is any kind of reporter or journalist he's a buffoon and you go right down the list\n\nRight down the list nine things you need to know about illegal immigration and crime this is two years ago the daily wire Byron band learn number one federal state and local governments keep data involving illegal immigration and crime out of the public purview\nFox News reported in twenty Fifteen that a source from immigration and Customs Enforcement ice and I love ice\nI've said that quote that comprehensive statistics on illegal immigrants crime are not available from the federal government that suggested contacting county state and federal jail and prison systems individually to compose a tally a process that would encompass thousands of local governments so in other words\nIt's the official position of the federal government not to provide you with the crime statistics\nNot to track\nIt they track everything\nExcept that number two available evidence suggests that illegals are in fact more likely to commit crimes and the rest of the population\nFox News sorted through ... local state and federal statistics and found that illegal immigrants are three times as likely to be convicted of murder as members of the general population and account for far more crimes than their three point five percent share of the U.S population would suggest\nNow why isn't this information reported today\n\nOn good morning America on the today show by ... by well let's hear what\n\nThe percentage of illegals committing the number of crimes are as follows according to Fox Thirteen point six percent of those sentences for all committed crimes of the country ... percent of murder sentences sixty percent of trafficking sentence\nNumber three this is a daily wire almost fifty percent of federal crimes committed near the Mexico border\nA report from the department of justice in twenty fourteen found the following via judicial watch\nAnd it gives the specific statistics\nNumber for illegal immigrants account for nearly Seventy five percent of federal drug sentences in twenty four team this is according to the United states sentencing commission which also found that illegals were involved in nearly Seventeen percent of drug trafficking sentences and over thirty three percent of federal sentences overall\nAren't how do you know these people are committing crimes while I don't know about specific individuals but these are the statistics I thought big government leftist likes the pistons\nNumber five a disproportionate amount of illegals are in state prisons Peter personnel in remember the U.S commission on civil rights lawyer\nReview statistics from the government Accountability Office and to Research Center and compared the number of illegals and not illegal in prison for murder related offenses any twenty Fifteen National Review piece some of the findings\nThey're almost Seventy thousand illegal aliens in prison for every one hundred thousand illegals in Arizona\nLet me correct that there were sixty eight point five seven\nAre illegal aliens in prison for every one hundred thousand illegals in Arizona compared to fifty four point oh six citizens and legal non citizens and he goes on but you can imagine what the statistics are\nPersonal knowledge that while comparing murder incarceration rates as an imperfect measurement it's difficult to contend that illegal aliens or more are law abiding\nThat legal residence at least when it comes to major crimes but the more disturbing fact was the approximately two thousand four hundred and thirty illegal aliens who are in prison just for homicide related offenses in California alone\n\nNumber six tens of thousands of criminal illegals have been released by ice and our large in the country\nIn twenty Fifteen ice released almost twenty thousand illegals that committed sixty four thousand crimes that evolved over twelve thousand drunken driving convictions Seventeen hundred and twenty eight cases of assault two hundred and sixteen kidnappings and more than two hundred homicide or maim slurry convictions\nAnd this is why when you have a fool like the mayor of Tallahassee Gillum who says that they will not turned over\nConvicted\nIncarcerated and then fried illegal aliens to be deported by ice they will not turn them over to I Do understand that Florida\nYou understand what I'm Talking about [noise]\nYou've got a radical who\nWho wants to be your governor I've got more when I return [noise]\n\n\nAnd not to mention the ... I went back in the car three times a week right away scratching all night long bouncing on the side of the day keeping me awake whole entire night from scratch and chewing it kind of makes you never\nYou wouldn't know that because when the president raises it and he's done a lot of work on the states you're them as Thirteen so's attorney general Jeff Sessions said the U.S attorneys all across the country when you raise it they blow it off and everyone just not MSN I watched the Baghdad well not only a small number yeah everybody's not MS ...\nThese insane inane arguments\n[laughter] [noise]\nAnd the hearts of MS Thirteen of extended to the Brentwood community and Long Island New York and they've committed horrendous crimes in Virginia on Long Island and in other cities the west coast around LA memory\nSanctuary cities have hampered law enforcement of cracking down on gangs the great Heather Mac Donald documented the frustrations of Los Angeles law enforcement officers all the way back in two thousand for when they couldn't touch known gang members because of their status as well eagles\nWe can't even talk about it says are frustrated LAPD captain people are afraid of a backlash from Hispanics and other LAPD commander in a predominantly Hispanic gang infested district size I Would get a firestorm of criticism if I talked about enforcing the immigration law against illegals\nThe issue is that these gang members tended to sneak\nBack into the country even after they were deported for heinous crimes of police officers couldn't enforce immigration laws against them would have to resort to surveilling these gang members until they committed a crime\nNumber nine\nClimate was also increased among major cities that are immigration hubs\nDeli wire editor in chief Ben Shapiro's written quote David from the Atlantic\nNo hard core to immigration opponent and a kind of a coup but anyway\nWrote in twenty Fifteen that as a twenty eleven there were twenty five thousand illegal immigrants\nServing murder sentences and nearly three million offenses committed by illegal immigrants between two thousand three and two thousand nine including Seventy thousand sex crimes and hundreds of thousands of other violent crimes\nAfter years of welcome declined from pointed out crime rates are rising in immigration hubs including Houston\nMilwaukee Phoenix San Diego you got that Gloria border you idiot\nAnd New York it was thirty four percent Arizona seventeenth birthday present during those years criminal aliens accounted for thirty eight percent of all murder convictions and the five states have California Texas Arizona Florida and New York well illegal aliens constituted only five point six percent\nThe total population in those states\nNow there's no denying the fact is\n\nYou've got a guy running for governor Gillum in Florida that does not a problem with this\nOnce a criminal illegal alien is released from prison rather than having a detain her to hold on for the feds to deport them Gillum says abolish ice and now we're not gonna work to get a dead painter now think about that Florida\n[noise] think about that ladies and gentlemen this is the official position of\nThe United states the ... at Democratic Party the Democratic party it's the official position to abolish ice it's the official position that localities in states local and state law enforcement should not work with ice\nThey've smeared ice\nIce isn't even the border patrol ice protects the interior of the United states\nFrom illegal and criminal immigrants and you're supposed to hate them\nNow you know actual facts if you're watching cable TV this the news parts of cable TV so called you didn't hear any of this\nInstead all your herd all day today and yesterday was trashing Trump\nThat's what you've heard you've heard\nReportage yell at the Trump do you know for sure there are terrorists among the seven thousand what kind of a stupid question is that my response to the reporter is do you know that every one of the seven thousand haven't committed crimes that none of them are terrorists\nThe whole point is there a legal allies they're not going through the vetting process well the president said they're criminals among them they're terrorists among them well I have no doubt they're all\n\nCriminals know what they're doing terrorist though what they're doing what we have to wait for them to do something\nBut that's not even the point\nThey're not allowed in our country as a matter of federal law\n\nThe media do not have the same compassion for American citizens who violate federal law they don't have that same passion\nFor American citizens who may get their taxes wrong or maybe violate Obamacare and so forth and so on\n\nWhat's happened in this country is the Democratic party in the media have romanticized\nIllegal immigration that romanticized illegal aliens\n\nThat's the propaganda that's going on in this country that\nThe illegal immigrant is noble or better more hard working then the American citizen\nAnd these for\nThat the illegal immigrant is noble or better more hard working and the American citizen and these fools in the Democratic party and some of the Republican Party but let's be honest really the Democrat Party is a near monopoly on this little\nLegal immigration\nThese fools on the Democratic party these phone calls in the media at least for an island\nWhat they're doing to this country it's unparalleled it's unparalleled\n\nWe have a president who calls it like it is we have a president who's trying to address his hands are tied by ridiculous laws his hands are tied by the Democrat Party the media tried to beat him down even though they fail\nImmediate desperately wants the Democrats the when the selection\n\nAll the free media the Democrats get incredible they desperately want the Democrats win this election they reject the results of the twenty sixteen election do the media\nEven this Gloria Bolger on CNN's it's twenty sixteen all over again to\nShut up you idiot\n\nWe know the vast majority of these people are Democrats and liberals poll after poll has shown and they can no longer conceal their ideology\n\n... what kind of people what kind of citizen\nRoot for illegal aliens that come into your country and they don't know if there's any terrorists and they don't know if there's any criminals\nWhat kind of journalists do this sort of thing for us and phoning that what do they sort of thing I'll be right back [noise] much\nIn\nDoctorate go get candidate

the things with wheels on them go down in value\nYeah and you make a hundred and forty thousand and you've got about eighty five thousand dollars tied up in rolling stock and um it doesn't make sense I mean you're going to want to get ahead financially as long as you run with that value system um you know officially\nWent through our financial ... you never see my husband's ride the box I thought

okay to accept a job that pays less\nBut has excellent employee benefits [noise]\nNo [noise]\nBecause you are placing value on those benefits that as absurd and you're making your decision using wrong critical thought okay\nYou you're assuming that the only way to get excellent benefits and the only way to cover the issues that the benefits cover is to take less pay\nWhy don't we go with another option make more money with excellent benefits\n\nBut see everybody is a dumb this down\nYou have to assume the only way I can be happy is make less money the only way I could get securities make less money the only way I could get benefits is make less money but he always had but make less money at the end of the sentences why can't you go I can make more money and be happy\nI can make more money and give benefits\nSo you got to look at it that way to start with ... and make more money but it it's amazing that people think that they got there there is some kind of a trade off here it's a\nFalse it's a false it's a false logic\nWhich is actually an oxymoron but um it it's just\nIt's bad critical thinking skills ... no no no no it's not okay okay okay just for that reason that's not okay is there a difference between a psycho score and inexperience or Equifax score ...\nEquifax has been given a score it's a waste suck we'd all released all of our data to the entire world [laughter] that's the perfect score\nAnd Experian doesn't have a short now I'm ... I don't think either one of these have a separate scoring rather than fight though I don't I'm I'm not aware experience website doesn't show anything except psycho score on it\nWell maybe they have a program and I'm just not aware of it where there started their own score um or maybe Equifax\nAs Rebecca ... facts as I don't care and nobody cares what I ... a more [noise]\nBut um except their former president who made like a hundred and eighty billion dollars for wedding uh but\nUh no uh\nI wouldn't worry about it I wouldn't worry about any of these scores by the way because they're all based on you borrowing money and so again it's a set of false logic it's it's bad critical thinking 'cause the only way you get a high cycle scores to borrow money and why do you get a high score so you can borrow money\nThis whole thing is about playing 'cause she faced with a bang somewhere worshipping at the altar of a false God called fight go psycho is not your provider the only think psycho

the income that you are making you\nShould get term life insurance today and it doesn't matter whether you're thirty to forty two or twenty two if you're a mom and your earning an income and your kids are counting on your income then you would need about ten to twelve times your income on you and yeah I ... a life insurance coverage death\nIn statistically the older you are the more likely you are to die\nSo it gets more expensive it's pretty simple math formula and so yeah\nTwenty thirty two is more than twenty two in less than forty two years old uh the the premiums are less so\nBut it's not

I did\nYes I decided I needed something to keep keep me going and keep me keep the um\nMomentum going so\nLike ... I'm also interested in the other part the part where it didn't work like when you first started you took it and you were like twenty three twenty four years old and it didn't take you didn't go crazy you didn't do this you waited a lot like six years before you\nGet mad as it did I got you got to ... what made the difference the causes which ...\nI think coming up then it was close to ten years that I was getting closer to what I've been doing this calendar shame drew a little bit of ... at first I was a tortoise for a long time I was just going\nAs it as a teacher didn't make a whole lot of money and I started teaching and then you know two thousand nine and she does that mean we were twenty six and you were fun yeah and it was doing some stuff and then I was using that credit card that I kept for emergency oh all those emergencies and I\nHave a lot of the classes were candidates I took it again and now I teach it because I mean that you know no you know do I do it shorter masters you\nGot the information you didn't apply it all before but then just the the fact that it's just not getting anywhere no traction in the decades coming up and the that got you fired up again is that right is that the audience\nIs and I had to just and I had to learn to budget and had to kind of figure out the cash and telling telling my money where to\nGo and what like that doesn't take a decade took it took\nMe a little while [laughter] me a little while I don't want to add to your wants to change this war to watch it and I think\nHe wanted to do it and all of a sudden and when you want to do something there's no stopping somebody I mean ... and delivering pizzas and get her done by computer done you did good I'm proud of you think you know really well done they might make fun of you\nKnow really ...\nJust like okay they understood they'd ever made fun of me but they are and that is back a few people especially in the beginning when I was using the envelope system would make fun of me they kind of like what is a hard roll all that water you joined a cold [laughter] what are you using all this cash what do you do it\nAll very very well done what's your advice now that you're teaching the clash what if somebody in your class and you think they're going to wait and they're not going to do it for six or seven years are you going to get them move and\nI tried to tell I tell them that it's worth it and that you just you have to try new things and it's going to take some time um and then I kind of give them suggestions what works for me one of the main ones that works for me it was cash and um 'cause within bearable income you can always kind of maneuver that budget money around a little bit\nAnd when it straight when there's cash and at the end of the month and there's ... like\nTwenty dollars in your account and you can get by on the shoes or go shopping\nFor a little so well done very well done\nWe got a copy of course Hogan is number one buzz showing book

unanswerable and my term life insurance will expire next year I'm In our FDU class there are several of us that are considered uninsured herbal so our one of our questions is what should we do instead of term life insurance and in my case\nI already have accidental death insurance in place should I go ahead and canceled or keep it since I'm now can't get term insurance\nHow old are you [noise] forty three why are you not ...\nHistory of diabetes I'm no longer diabetic but I I just got 'em that diagnosis removed but I've had that in the past five years of my history\nOkay have you checked with Zander insurance and see what they can write you\nWe're in the process of having them do that kind of a double check\nOkay on dry out or something yeah because you know every day that goes by you're going to be more and more trouble in your situation so that's great news just ... hopefully as a short lived a\nIssue okay because in other words I think I think you're gonna be able to get insurance I just don't know exactly when or what is going to cost that's the other thing you've got to look at where he could be unreasonable but I'm diabetes is a real tough\nDiagnosis for life insurance really tough\nSo um anyway\nThe answer your question overall is if someone's uninsured boy yes you would keep accidental death at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental\nWould be your cause a except that you've had the diabetes issue um but otherwise I mean you you statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidental death as you know but it's better than having no insurance\nRight so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kind of gimmick insurance is what it is a\nDefinitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay you know to the very last moment and if your term is expiring see if they have you checked to see if they have a renewal and non medical renewal\nTo join us America we're glad you're\nFor like eight to five five two to five Chelsea is in Los Angeles high Chelsea how are you\nI'm doing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up in your world\nI had a question for you in regards to um\nOur the papers the salary my my husband is transitioning trip position I'm aware they're going to be giving him a pay raise but with that pay raise their I'm saying that he also has that they're going to be transitioning him into salary pay\nHe usually works between five and twenty hours of overtime each week so I wanted to make sure that when I hear they haven't given him an art form I forget that when they do want it to make sure that\nHow would you how would you recommend to calculate whether\nThe salary rate is comparable with for example the hour the he was working for and the pay that he would get what overtime\nWhich sounds like it would be simple you've been working Fifteen to twenty hours a week last year extra and you've been paid for that and overtime correct correct and so what was his income last year including the overtime\nWith about forty thousand and how will that compared to the salary\nBut that's the part that we don't know yet as\nConservatives salary is ... at the salary is fifty that's raised if the salary is forty five and the same number of hours or expect to be work its effect of layer probably cut\nRight\nYes does that make sense it's like\nYeah like as we were I was kind of weird because it was just more if it were in the ... member to mhm um I Know that he has the potential to work more hours so because of that I was kind of\n... about it but the question the question is not just more hours the question is is this a good deal for him apples to apples not a ... and ... and has he got the chance to move up in the company because he moved to salary\nYes he's going to be moving to management position\nNo but I mean further up later oh okay but let's say let's say they offer him fifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary where we'd be dancing wouldn't we\nYes okay because that's what we're\nFifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary will we be dancing wouldn't we\nYeah\nOkay 'cause that's like that's like getting paid a lot more and I'm working the same number of hours you know and it's like ... it's almost like he picked up more hours but didn't have to work on you see what I'm saying but it but again if they want to give him a salary and act like they did him a favor and it's a man and he gets paid forty\nBut he's working in the same number of hours where he's working when he's making forty eight then that's not a blessing\nYeah just making sense to you yeah that makes sense\nIf it's even if it's forty eight to forty eight we still like the salary because of the upward\nPotential okay long term it's a long term good career movies moving into leadership into management and that's where he wants to head towards long term but I'm the you know yes but but again you just compare it to last year's income so the\nWhole thing comes down to how does it compare to forty eight thousand what's the salary do 'cause that's what he was making working the hours that he's going to continue to be working apparently\nChris is with us from Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Chris how are you\nI'm doing good they taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nUh well right now I'm a Nick income about thirty one thousand dollars a year [noise] I've got a fourteen hundred dollars in credit card debt\nOr about eleven thousand a student loan debt that are that bad about six months ago was about Nineteen thousand ... I've been working working hard and saved my money and paying it off as much as I can good or not across right now I came up with the idea for an invention ...\nAnd I don't know whether to keep you know steam rolling my debt plan and doing all that are just you know kind of jumped ship and say hey this is something that could you know be my future and potentially mhm\n[laughter] so [laughter] I mean it kind of want a financial advisor them you know what to do with the remaining dead I have ... and yeah my aspiration crying because I'm In the process I've been saving to uh get a VA home loan now is just about there so [noise] any advice you can give me I'd be greatly appreciated\nRight well I'm going to avoid buying a home until I got the debt cleared the only question is then how can we start working on the invention idea and make some money now because we don't need to make a a bunch of money five years from now we need some money today\nOne of 'em twenty thousand dollars today show the invention you came up with as a physical product\nYes sir and say yeah odor the odor either slash a mold um lives in a small machine that um people can do on their home\nOkay and you've made one\nI made a bury 'em rudimentary crowded type ... the next the next phase I've got is like either dip into my rainy day fund or start come into my regular cash flow\nAnd like buying a computer and get my three D. modeling and get me a couple of silicon prototype so I can go you know take it to a you know take the next level or what I Want to do\nSo again Dr jump off my my debt plan more do I have case my invention [laughter] okay\nUm well what you're talking about you could spend anywhere from twenty five dollars to a two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it there's really no in between I mean you could just go anywhere you want to go with this there's a lot of money to be spent on something like this\nAnd if you were a billionaire and you you know what you would do is you would build a couple of them and you get them out there and test them and make sure that they work and that there was a market for it before you went into production\n... because you don't go into production on prototypes that are on tested uh from an R and D standpoint or you don't go into production on something that I've got no market for it not been able to sell it because you're gonna let you make a hundred thousand of them and having them in your\nBasement if you had unlimited sums ever be able to sell them you know ... I like\nTrying to ah continue to do with the way you're doing it and that's just piece it together and let's build one and let's find somebody to put one in there in the property and a commercial applications\nAnd let's say let me give you just let's just make up a pretend example okay here would be like your ideal thing you build one or two in your garage and you convince these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the the form of it we're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the idea works\nAnd if the ideal works than what I'm going to want you to his place in order for ten of them or thirty of them or a hundred of them for for all of your locations okay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside to test it and then if a place that order they just place in the closet with you large enough\nTo build the order mhm and it finds itself that's called organically cash flowing something\nIn other words you prove it to somebody who's going to be a big customer and they place an order with enough of a deposit took to manufacture your first order out\nWhen they think I should dial down my rather than just been all my extra capital towards paying off my credit card debt and my student loan debt\nI don't think you have to much capital on this you've already we're already built one in the garage yeah build another one okay maybe a couple of hundred bucks right\n[noise] well I ... in that but I I just see I'm a protection if I wanted to be you know a good good looking at\nThat time now it's a prominent like there are no perfect sense [laughter] very they're very purpose of a prototype despite all the crap that's broken [laughter] you're not going to get it perfect you're going to put it out there in the end the marketplaces gonna kick it around\nAnd you're going to learn form and function changes informants function changes in the switch has to be on that side in this which has to be made out of this was none of that and you're only going to learn that after you beat up about a hundred of them but let's get two of them in somebody's restaurant\nIn there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later are two of them in somebody's industrial application and they've got um you know they've got forty more they will order if it works because it's the best thing since sliced bread I got to have the ... I'm ... and then they give you enough money\nIn there a deposit for the initial order for you to\nYour manufacturing and basically you got almost nothing out of pocket except your brain power and you're sweating and your smile out there selling it and that's how a lot of these things get off the ground\nWay a lot of people lose a lot of money on them is they go into mass production before something proven in the marketplace for the actual prototypes\nAnd you're talking to a guy's lost money that way the stupid stuff so [noise] do easy man go easy this was the day Ramsey show\nFor years and one of the most asked questions I get is day one are you going to do a live um in in our city\nAll yeah thank you\nHow neat course they've and I I just take a few moments you know to the to the

I started out in junior high school a gold my dad financial these university classes our local church and while as I say I'm truly a which really appreciative of your\nTime and who am I don't know yet on her uh twenty six years old All right Nate how can I help today sir\nYes so I have a pretty quick question I'm with my employer I have two different retirement account and uh when I leave 'em I Will be best it obviously um should I convert them to a traditional i._r._a. are a lot that ray I'm right now there for one a and for three B. and fidelity\nOkay um well the four oh one K. is after tax correct\nSo that doesn't have any penalty to converted to a rough I always suggest\nAs a general rule when you leave your employer\nTake everything that's vested enroll it into an Iranian good growth struck mutual funds you're more accessibility more control and more options to pick from in the open market than you do leaving something behind in trying to manage it through a former employer right now that I Would not converted to a Roth if it's pre tax\nUnless you're out of debt have your emergency fund and have some extra money to pay the taxes that creates but the four oh one hey you can go ahead and stick that into a route that doesn't cost you a dime\nOkay there's already after tax money that's in there um yeah that could be some growth in there that how you don't pay taxes on possibly um but it probably wouldn't be much\nSo just you know ... are you out of debt\nI Will be I have about ten thousand dollars left on a student loan but um by the time I make the transition of that covered\nOkay well then the other question is when you're not going to have your emergency phone number ... so we're not we don't do anything that creating taxes so when you sit down with your smart Mr pro roll it all over to Iowa raise\nA traditional IRAs unless you can move some of it to a Roth IRA in similar mutual funds um without any taxes and then later on if you want to convert it to

should go with from my student loans a minimum\nPayments on every thing except your smallest alone and throw every dollar you can possibly throw at it when it's gone attack the next one down when it's gone attack the next one down that's called the debt snowball and that is the most efficient way and the most of the highest probability way to get out of student loan debt\nVery fast and very hard do not get into income based repayment plans do not get into I'm going to pay the minimum I can pay I Want you pay the freaking maximum you can pay doesn't want Sallie Mae if they did get that old ugly woman out of your house\nShe is not a good roommate you want her to leave Louis is on\nFacebook should pull a thousand dollars on my four one K. to do baby step one\nYou don't cash out of four O. one K. except to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure when you take money out of your four o one K they charge you a ten percent penalty plus your tax rate\nNow that means if you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year household income your tax rates twenty five percent plus ten percent that means you just got charged thirty five percent interest\nIn fact\nI mean it's not technically interest it's penalties in taxes but you never borrow money thirty five percent interest to bond your baby step\nOne no no no no no no no or would you use that to pay off debt thirty five percent hit no no\nWell they told me their only hope and Tony percentile that's all they're required to withhold but that's not the calculation of how much the government keeps you in the teeth\nThe government keeps you in the teeth out of ten percent penalty plus your tax rate you do not cash out retirement accounts unless it's to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure auction save your home yeah or if you're so far in debt is the only way you keep from filing bankruptcy yeah you would do that\nBut at that point you're beyond desperate you're in deep weeds you know\nDefinitely not never catch it out to buy a car or you

... with you for the next couple of hours we're going to talk about the subject that\nYou may not feel directly you know may not even sense it but it's it's here and it's serious and it's very very dangerous\nIt has to do with what's happening in the middle east we have to special guests for you let me introduce them first Fred Burton front as a vice president of intelligence and counterterrorism at the Stratford leading geo political intelligence for him and he's one of the world's foremost experts on security\nTerrorists in terrorist organizations he's a former State Department counterterrorism deputy chief DSS agent and the author of a best selling memoir ghost confessions of a counter terrorism agent didn't chasing shadows here's Fred first of all Fred welcome to the program looking forward to this\nThank you for having me on again George or was\nIt was spent about seven years since you were last on with us but I'm Glad you're back\nSamuel Katz is a New York times best selling author and an internationally recognized terrorism law enforcement in military special operations expert is written more than twenty bucks in hundreds of articles in the Arab Israeli conflict\nInternational counterterrorism military and law enforcement special ops and Palestinian and Islamic fundamentalists tour as well Samuel welcome to to the program\nThank you so much for having me and their book is called bay Ruth rules the murder of a CIA station chief in his bowl as war against America a friend Sam ... of the Lebanese a heritage and I'm very familiar with that\nTore blown the country now be used to be the jewel of the middle east it isn't anymore Fred isn't\n[noise] no I'm afraid not a George ah we've watched it deteriorate for several years now and of course a Hezbollah has become a very strong and country and ah operates as an Iranian proxy\nAnd how long Samuel has this been going on with the Rand backing Hezbollah and who are the are these Lebanese people or are they Iranians who are they\nWell Hezbollah the Lebanese party of God the Shiite um religious militia [noise]\nUm [noise]\nIranian proxy groups that were formulating around the time of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in Nineteen eighty two\nI'm living on ... you know of ... ... between the Sunni the Christian and the Shiite population for domination of the country and the sharing were always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy eight one of the Shiite spiritual leaders were murdered in Libya and left the vacuum in the country and and that coincided with the onset of\nAyatollah Khomeini and Iran and the Iranian Revolution and they ... of the Iranian for a possible fertile ground to spread the revolution in Lebanon and they ... they than intelligence specialist Samantha revolutionary guard\nTo live and on with theory of laughing and they said of faith in Lebanon and they establish among the many\nVery guardsmen to Lebanon with serious blessing and they set of faith in Lebanon and they established amongst the many state within in many states that was very obvious to many inside the country I'm for them I interviewed\nA few people who are journalists the\nTime in Lebanon and they said that the Iranian influence was everywhere um sadly the the two people of the two groups that neglect this this arrival and the amount of money and the amount of influence of the Iranians were spreading a little bit on\nWhere the Israelis and the Americans to people that have a vested interest in keeping 'em the Iranians way out of Lebanon\nFred is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as el ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a relative a statement uh before uh Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than\nThan any other group I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on the u._s. embassies and the hijackings and the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which\nUh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a kind of some history or\nDoes it never been done this was an organization that had\nA literally a snatched or the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild a all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing\nUh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um\nIt it was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred uh but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because\nUh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley uh we we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us exactly where he was so um\n[noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are certainly a um I'll never forget and uh but I Know that there was a ... a heck of a lot of us that that certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\nWhen we get into that story or want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty is Wilfrid ... what what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise] Georgia and it's a fair question or you can only look back on the events of ah nine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers and\nThe plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon or as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region or why we need a footprint\nUh in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy or and or or take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil\nAnd uh that's the the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nOr we're going to talk about William Buckley you're just a moment we're with red Burton Samuel Katz new book is called the roots rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them on what truly is\nA very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized in hopefully Fred than Sam you're with your book be rules you get more and more exposure\nTo what's happening over there and if you can see I'm In a couple of minutes we have before the break give us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nWell speaking of Hezbollah um\nThe Hezbollah forces have been fighting from the onset alongside rainy and special forces to help keep 'em president off of um regime in power um has ... has been transformed from an underground fourth\nI'm In the Nineteen eighties the period we're for them I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of 'em this fundamentalist suicide Shiite brands of terrorism and it has emerged into probably one of the stronger almost conventional armies in the middle east\nUm it is for the United states in Iraq\nIt was um it was absolutely in a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq\nTo fill up there um I eat these um strategies and tactics that killed so many American servicemen in two thousand ... launched a um horrific war against Israel where I'm\nLaid siege movie of indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities um it does involve the narco terrorism because one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm\nI'm traffickers in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with\nThat we cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has it we ... them operatives in this country\nHas for many years and it is an arm and extension of Iran was um a desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important to us national interests\nAll countries of course work through straw parties we worked with the Selma bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets either they're\nGiving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah but why are we getting talk with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions why don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stopped supplying them we're gonna win ... why don't we do that Sam\nI think that this country has been very apprehensive about engaging Iran militarily since our hostages were seized with the U.S embassy in Tehran\nI'm a many many years ago I think there were numerous um declarations of war by Iran has like in the United states\nThe bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and to see the bombing of marine barracks which was um on the thirty five years ago to this day\nStart hiring with Lincoln jobs today go to link dot com slash working you get fifty dollars off your first job that's linked in dot com slash working for your fifty dollars on terms and conditions on by the names\nOn the news on the hour more stimulating talk Ninety seven point one the big talk coast to coast more stimulating talk\nPan welcome back to coast to coast red Burton with those Samuel ... book is called be rude rules Sam you were mentioning of course that a Hezbollah may have sleeper cells in the United states is that possibly one reason we haven't gone after Iran militarily and attack them because we're afraid that those cells could be activated\nNo I don't think so I think um we haven't gone after Iran militarily because we're not really sure what a direct military conflict with the wrong might bring I think the Iranian youth of groups like Hezbollah to export terrorism throughout the middle east\nAnd the rest of the world is daunting and the four um policy planners in this country for generations it was um directly responsible for a lack of response to suicide truck bombing of the\nEmbassies the marine and the kidnapping of a CIA station chief\nFrom things that was unheard of in the world of espionage up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only station she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered in the history of the agency\nFor Britain tell us about what you Buckley\n[noise] a bill was a a a true patriot George uh he uh grow up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening this is not the journalist we're talking about\nNo it's not there's actually a funny Side Story to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years I\nWrote them and uh our bill thought it was pretty funny and\nThought about a cashing them but I'm a\nBill grow up in the Boston area a salmon I were lucky enough to ah get the cooperation of bills a family has a elderly companion or that he's lived with for many many years and a sister who just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up uh\nI'm In he went off after high school into the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea\nAs a young kid\nAnd um where he was a silver star recipient and are\nAlso a Purple Heart I'm at which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into now than it comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates gets hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties it was very murky or as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find a anybody that can tell us specifically what he was up to a but regardless I'm\nA he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things when you know\nDidn't surprise me because of uh the nature of it as a curiosity and his languages and you know ... to\nTo just I'm a study history and specially military history\nUh so uh in Nineteen sixty or he joins or the U.S army again a and goes under special forces are and um and it's also a associated with the CIA in that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter and recruiter and I'm Bill goes off or\nTo Vietnam and where he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire a\nSo this was a man George that was always running towards danger and uh\nHe he reminds me of the NYPD a cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers up\nYou know show no fear they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um and and off the bill uh was uh\nUh the only guy to raise his hand to to volunteer to go to the root uh at the CIA uh after this devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station is wiped out so [noise] um that was his Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nNow was his assignments bread in Beirut clandestine or was it pretty well known by people\nWell the station chief or um is usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the or the CIA officer the chief of station\nAnd of course the other intelligence liaison services know that to such as the Jordanians the French the Israel was and so forth so I'm Bill is not a and a undercover position during that time period\nSomebody read it on him no doubt well\nUh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period um it you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meets niche as a and so forth and so uh you know bill was that kind of person\nAnd I'm In essence a leading his apartment one day a in Nineteen eighty four you know he's\nKnow bill was that kind of person and I'm In essence a leading his apartment one day a in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles are and Hezbollah grab them and um they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't he have security around [noise] it's a good question or I can tell you a first hand from that time period a it was an unusual for station chiefs and not to have security\nUh salmon I did our last book on been godly or where you had a whole Qadri a professional uh security personnel to specifically watch or CIA officers backs\nAre in that time period are they really didn't exist you could request security you could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but\nUh you can't really do your job is a is a secret agent to use that phrase with an entourage so ah the nature of the job and that and that time period was a you're a single time you were kind of like a a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for what about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\nHe was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and\nUm I was part of the hostage debriefing team where are we were assigned to at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out to who was a wonderful man I spoke to him an instant and visa button Germany after he had been held in captivity\nAnd and he told us bill had died and that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because um we had devoted to the entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so\nThen it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWell must have been like looking for a needle in the haystack rental\nOh my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was a time period um you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then\nUm we we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but um it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a a person in a building or in a cherry barracks\nI'm ... and we literally could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge a intelligence gaps\nAnd it was extraordinarily frustrating I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was\nA at one point or the FBI believed that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran a and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut\nWhile I'm which I'm not you\nCertainly a smoking gun or as to who is directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam ... let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time jak Anderson wrote an article about ... William Buckley simply saying\nHe was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but where do you think do jak Anderson's column accurate or not\nI I think if I'm fairly safe to assume that under torture I'm Bill Buckley um revealed information\nI'm a very classified nature I'm a station chief um he was the supervisor he was the um the branch manager of the ... the U.S intelligence apparatus in Lebanon\nIn the car please\nSpeak ... isn't okay when it comes to drinking and driving sealed warning signs in a car\nDriving drunk driving\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nOf or a financial studios you are listening to Ninety seven point what Haiti decay Conchita village in Arizona's more stimulating\n[noise]\nA second caravan of the way ...

the eating is\nA you know it's it's just it's just the idea that ... and it's been bouncing around for years is that you know we as the you know the population of this planet won't be able to handle

more stimulating talk [noise]\nIf you have a watched and listen to this program and read the things that we have written you're not surprised and you are way ahead of the game of what's going on with this caravan let's give you some additional information because it's\nIt's\n... it's very important what Mike Pence said yesterday Mike Pence came out in the oval office and said this is being funded by Venezuela now the mainstream press they're not gonna do anything but ridicule that but this makes sense\nIt makes perfect sense and it does sound crazy when you first hear about it like if you're not if you don't know the back story here like Venezuela you know like oh here we go again as they can they can't afford anything yeah there's blaming something in the country so we can get involved or whatever you know or yeah or the how do they even have the money to do this\nBut um it makes perfect sense when you hear it when you put it into the context of the relationship to Honduras had with a both Venezuela in Cuba it makes absolutely perfect sent in particular these\nThis group that SARS started this caravan they are the group that is that backed the ousted Marxist\nOr radical a president was ousted in Honduras\nRight and there they still have a populist the avenue to go to like their gold or stated goal is still to restore that President back to the power and he was and they do have kind of a case there and an international case because he was democratically elected\n... so the really if they can make such a firestorm\nSuch a big media uprising over this get international support and backing they could technically eventually may try and get this guy back into power but that is their goal that and that's where this started and I think that's where Honduras that this party these people in Honduras while they originally organized this but Venezuela also has other\nReasoning a reason to be behind this\nNow if you I mean you think about it just was a few months ago\nUm Venezuelan President Maduro would just survived it an assassination attempt\nAnd he blamed the United states people in the United states for um we're backing those people he blames nine states for the economic or her basically ... all the things that are wrong with him it's not socialism in the United states has fault that at that socialism by working out the theory behind and\nUm so he blames us for all these things so if you arm adore oh you want to strike back they just tried to kill you and his words how do you do it when you can't compete with the United states in a conventional manner you have to go non conventional\nWay and you have to understand too that\nIt was the ousting of the Honduran presidency the guy this caravan support when he was ousted the first thing the new government did or one of the first things a new government did was get out of the album agreement\nWhich was agreements of hey we're going to prop each other up so as soon as\nHonduras pulled out a way from Venezuela that hurts them economically big time\nSo he's got a double reason for doing this ... this is huge and this is huge so you really need to look at it through that lens they have a gigantic political and future economic reasoning behind all this is a very big plan it you know in place to do all that\nI mentioned before that um Iran and both Syria were big time observers of this economic union\nAnd a lot of people have been focusing on what what if ISIS gets into this uh you know to this group or whatever you mentioned the possibility of Cuban intelligence Venezuela intelligence was I think it's\nProbably Ninety percent likely that they are part of this caravan\nUm but also a through I or Iran Hezbollah\n... could be all in this a caravan I I have no information on that note no intelligence behind it\nBut because of all the actors because of everyone involved the because of the people that are are are still ... Venezuela Iran\nRight you could be a chasm below would be my ... if I'm In a U.S intelligence operative I'm looking for Hezbollah links you know inside this care of it and I guarantee you the U.S intelligence agencies are all over this I I'm sure we've infiltrated this\nThat's why when when the vice president United States\nSaid that oh the Honduran president told me this\nHe's not reporting on here say like that would be here say unless they seriously have something behind it\nI fully think that he knows I think I heard your interview with a gun or having a yesterday yeah he knew he knew as well he knew and of course that's something he would not come out and say oh Venezuela's behind this and the governor of Texas is not going to say that but I Do think vice president Pence tipped his hand on that I really think that they're behind the question now is\nHow does this escalate you mentioned waves of attacks we already know there's a there's a Caribbean forming an El Salvador there's a camera and forming in Guatemala and who are they form\nWho's forming them that we don't know the organizers yet but those are all they're all in the same border all with Honduras so the same people that liberty and re foundation party look that up when you're looking at these things up and doing your own homework liberty and re foundation party and Honduras I Would not be surprised if we're if we hear more names in El Salvador in Guatemala forming these\nUh caravans because the ah Honduras border was a shutdown pretty heavily they crack down on that border so they can't send more people on doors anymore\nSo they're probably going there those are their allies in El Salvador Guatemala are probably just forming them in their border countries\nAnd the press won't look into this in fact the press is downplaying this now and the reason why is because they know this is a nightmare for Democrats and the election this is an absolute nightmare\nI Would just I just I just want the mainstream media just to check on the children yes just could you do the um reports on\nHow are they\nOut who's taking care of the medical care young who's who is who is taking care of the food for seven thousand people the diapers\nAlone with the infant this sanitary conditions must be strong how are they sleeping how are they moving with somebody 'cause I Want to help I Want to help I just I didn't know if ... Smith showed where they were sleeping they're sleeping\nOn the pavement and it's burning hot pavement the ... on yeah and um\nWhere where are they getting the water because you can't take Seventy five hundred people into a small town you know and and and go into the seven eleven and say hey we need\nThat you know fourteen thousand bottles of water [laughter] you can't know no one for right now because I'm a little Thursday we haven't we haven't had a drink and two hundred miles and so I take one for the\nRoad one for the road for everybody and one drink now yeah\nI just need fourteen thousand bottles of water\nI'm sure this study is that there's a big at probably has fourteen thousand bottles of water okay yeah so I'm sure it's they just stop it stuck east yeah OK along the way ... um\nYou keep saying something about a political stunt you keep talking you know there's the funding funding funding ... well it right here oh okay oh all these questions about where they got they got them from\nA who organized or cause the caravan\nMhm ...\nOr ... initially organized this and in October force Facebook post he shared a graphic promoting a migrant march\nThe graphic told

to North but I'm\nHopeful bill there's two others the news that we've broken this morning there's two other caravans that are now forming behind this one\nWell because they've seen you know the seriousness of the countries along the way that they're just well no they're not going to be stopped so yeah [laughter] they continue to come and can you imagine if we allow these people all all\nFourteen thousand or however many are there and then the Caribbean after and the one after that what does that say to future ... no you're over so many foreign land is over it's over California

talker\nAnd\n[noise]\nWell come back or coming up after this segment I Am going to have on a retired colonel and congressional district one Republican candidate\nShe's been on many times a for a on the show to talk about her campaign uh and she's out there she's never short on telling it how she sees it\nUh she's very direct and ah she's a ... you hear her ads running you've heard her before on the program she tells it out is ... and sometimes that gets under people's skin\n'em but sometimes that's what's needed and I'm Talking about Wendy Rogers to stick around because Wendy Rogers will be on the program here after this segment to talk about the ah we're sorry about this migrant I'm immigrant uh this caravan that's going on in Mexico\nAnd why have we not heard\nMuch of anything out of the uh Democrats who are an office especially her opponent a congressional one Democrat who is currently there a tunnel Halloran first term Tom why haven't we heard anything\nI mean I talk to Democrats all time and they're not happy about people saying hey we're going to force their way up the border in up to your country uh that's not how it's done\nSo I Want to get her thoughts on that and plus the how the campaign for congressional district one is going I think it's very tight right now ah but another race I'm looking at her another election this year I'm looking at heavily a is Flagstaff they are\nVery tight right now but another race I'm looking at her another election this year I'm looking at heavily a is Flagstaff they are at the center of the minimum wage issue a nationwide people are watching this\nA ton of money has poured in from all over the place or a ton of money is being spent on ads and it it's getting hard to determine what's true what's not true I mean I've played that clip yesterday with Jerry neighbors with this like seventies or eighties claiming that the minimum wage work\nThat's why the economy in life says do so good but the economy and says donors doing good I just saw numbers they're huge increases the economy and Arizona's doing good\nThe U.S economy is doing good it's like steps that influential\nThe minimum wage issue in Flagstaff that the whole country's doing good or is it that the economy overall is just doing good right now and we're lucky that this horrible minimum wage law hasn't affected us yet but what happens during the next downturn\nThat's the big question that many folks who live in a slice of area who are looking at eventually a minimum wage uh Fifteen fifty and rapidly increasing prices that's what they're dealing with that is what proposition for Eighteen is all about\nNow Lauren is an editor you student who originally voted for the Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage but now she sees things through a different light\nSo I was a freshman then and I'm actually from Las Vegas Nevada so it was my first election ever voting and coming into Flagstaff I saw that oh ... for fourteen like minimum wage is going to go up and as a freshman at living on campus\nI wasn't currently working but in the future I knew I Would be getting a job so seeing now I was like wow like I totally in going to vote for that and yeah I voted for it voted for it to pass what\nDid you okay you is your first election where you were Nineteen\nYeah ... okay so you're Nineteen at a time your your freshman you said you're in the Newtown you're out of your home town you out of your home or your first time voting and you see this year I'm going to make I can make more because you're probably working for minimum wage it's I'm just making a lot of assumptions now are you working for minimum wage at the time\nUm I wasn't working I had been working at minimum wage back in Las Vegas and then in Flagstaff I was just it was a freshman year like I'm living on campus likely to just not doing anything but focus on my study is\nOkay but you vote on this thing and it's like hey we're gonna raise this up cars fly stuff is coming from Vegas it is a much higher cost of living for some folks who comes in from California it's like well this is cheaper right I'm even without a state tuition but for you it was more expensive correct\nYeah and living off campus in an apartment this year and actually having a job now I've realized how expensive it is to live in Flagstaff and it's actually almost sixteen ... percent more expensive in Flagstaff than Las Vegas\nWell okay so you can vote for this thing uh and it passes and it's the Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage did you think was there any I mean I'm just trying to get into the mines that there is no inflation or you know thinking oh this was just going to cause inflation but it's I mean that wasn't going through\nNow I mean I was super naive like the first year college wasn't really thing about that all like my parents were so supporting everything so now that I can see that it's actually affecting not just the people in the businesses than just living wage for me even to get ran or to buy groceries and anything I Do in Flagstaff\nOkay so fast forward a and folks and we're talking with Lauren Bradley who's the senior at NYU and like over who's a yet with the yes on for a chain fast forward well not even two years read to you trust or juniors and\nYou're seeing the impact now there's a new initiative on the ballot a prompt fourteen what's changed I assume you're supportive and fourteen\nYes I Am okay why\nI'm supportive of it because when I came back to fly south in August I knew I had to get a job because I was paying for my apartment I was taking classes at any you and I really had to start funding for myself\nSo I started searching for a job and I already knew that the jobs are very slim in Flagstaff just because it is a small community and a lot of people said over summer to work\nBut my friend ... she actually could not get a job all summer and how to move back home because she couldn't afford to live in Flagstaff without a job\nSo when I came up here I started applying online and all around and I cannot get a job they tell me about like three weeks to find something and not with after applying online going in with resumes and all that so\nThat when I started to realize that people are not hiring even though they need the help because they are not going to be able to afford it [noise]\nLet me ask you this are you an oddity or you just it's just a rarity among um now you're a senior so you were here for the last election and like I said for us for two years but however there's a whole crop of new freshman sophomore who weren't here for that process\nAre you hearing any shot or I mean it is what is is your position I rare position among students\nI don't think so I think with us seniors and the older ones that we've been there for both of them I think we realized that Flagstaff is expensive to live in and to be in but I think definitely the freshman incoming I don't think they're paying attention to that because like I said when you live on campus you're in the bubble yeah see not paying attention to it\nBut when you get older and you start realizing people aren't going to be able to get jobs and if they do get jobs it's just not going to be the same because there's not going to be as many hours to get out anyways [noise]\nFor the show Monday through friday a three year old boy
