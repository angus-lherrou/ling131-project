opportunity to win you locate from where I Am in Montana back to Boston which is where I'm from\n... and the single job would be a double my income mhm [noise]\nNow in doing so I Would not be bringing my family with me at first I had the opportunity to stay right of free with my father and work\nMhm why would I Want her family are with you\nUm affordability I Can't afford to move them I mean we're down even have a foundation to allow some dollars to start an offer dad I mean right now I'm dealing with like negative cash flow right does your wife work outside the home\n[noise] uh no she\nCan't care or I got four kids you have four kids okay yeah All right and do you own a home in Iraq okay\nAnd uh so basically you get a loan your furniture into a U Haul and pull it across the country and be in Boston and get an apartment right\n[noise] um well and the long haul yes but short term I Would try a plane ticket wow load your wife up and go\nI I wouldn't have the money to them a little apartment mhm okay\nSo uh you're going to be making twice as much though so how quickly would you be moving them\nAh well she's pregnant with our ... show the thought process would be in the summer probably August after birth\nNo I'm not doing the\nI'm not leaving my pregnant wife and four kids halfway around the dad gum world\nAnd go live with your dad not a chance unloading her up and move and do as you can you can have your family help you a little bit I mean I'm On costs much to get moved maybe the employer would give the new employer would give you an advance to get you moved into your new apartment\nUm there's a possibility with that yeah you need a load up your family and get out of there\nBut you know not being with your pregnant wife while she's carrying what your fifth child you're in Boston and she's in Montana who that is not okay [laughter]\nI mean you're not in the military you're not you're not required to be separated like that you're just making bad choices now you need you need to scrape together a few dollars and go deliver some\nPizzas or something and uh for a month and and pile up you know thousand Fifteen hundred bucks and get you a U Haul and get your button gear\nAnd enroll loan over to a Boston and take that job or move in with your dad for a month with the whole dad gummed crew over there if you can something like that I mean you need to find a different way but this idea you're going to lay bringing your whole family\nAnd while your wife is ... no no no that's not going to work out for you that's going to end poorly aren't going to share your leg links for calling in ban is one of those bands in Colorado Springs have ban how are you\nYeah you do better than I deserve what's up\nThere I Am self employed I'm a real estate agent and um we've got the thousand dollars for your baby steps wide and art but they were were\nKind of a crossroads on how to how to go up to about going on with the next babysat I'm of the opinion which isn't in your plan that you know because I'm self employed and money isn't\nAlways there I Need to have a you know two two months or so of income to fall back on in ... tip to be able to make the budget\nThat does your wife work like if\nHe does not she's a stay at home mother\nAnd are you so you're not making any money in the real estate business\nWell I'm a I'm not making a hundred thousand a hundred and ten thousand a year somewhere in there they are not having in the row months\nNot any zero a month or during the winter in Colorado there's um\nSome months at a slower than others where you know making the making the budget would be tight tighter than my ... I'm\nNot I don't I don't I never expand baby steps one emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly volatile and I think yours is not as volatiles your acting like it is\nYou might get a hundred grand and your whining about running out of money I mean really you really need to stop and think about what you just said but anyway if you're going to go to zero in December because nobody's buying a house in Colorado Springs in December you don't want to have zero money I'll go along with that part but\nI don't think that's what's really happening you making eight thousand dollars a month average\nSo I'm a five hundred to ten thousand a month whatever so anyway set some aside but we're not going to call in an emergency fund and we're not going to add to the thousand dollar account we call it an ill in the valley account\nThe Helmand valley is the volatility of your income the hill is when they come as good the valley is when it's bad and so if you want to set a couple of ground over there in that in addition to the thousand two separate accounts one is for emergencies and one is for you if you run out of money because you don't make any money in a month\nBut dude I don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow a analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run out of money\nI mean you can go make money and so um I don't I don't think it's happening if you told me he made forty thousand dollars in real estate business I can imagine you have in some zero much but you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money\nA year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back in track your revenues in charge revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nIn giving in certain months over in a long period of time you can go back go you know every January and February I'm always screwed this is where we are than okay since some money aside to cover that so that you do that but I don't think it's as bad as your emotions are telling you it is\nAnd uh but no we're not changing the emergency fun we might have a hill and valley account if you truly have a volatile income Mark's with us in Seattle hey mark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThank Dave hey it's a great honor to talk like yeah I Know you I had a great impact and changed my life five years ago um do you think you are currently I I I got a ... question I'm In baby steps sick\nI'm a got a net worth of a half million dollars uh [noise]\nWhat happened was five years ago I I left a small company with a great a company culture when I hear you talk about your company the company I was working for a very similar culture\nWas making an average salary for what I did I went to a competitor a much more of you making um I was making eighty thousand dollars a year what do you make now I make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year on your\nQuestion is what I make my question is I really miss that small company culture and um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise] um I think it would be a really\nReally interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of lost my passion for my work and um you know I show up to work every day I get great reviews um\nI'd probably go back but I Want some equity or I Want some indication that I can earn my way\nBack up to what you're actually worse than the marketplace this idea that in order to have a good work environment you have to make less\nIs not necessary is not necessarily an assumption I'm going with\nSo maybe that particular company can't pay you but if you want you can probably find somebody with these folks are\nAnd how you what your worse\nThat you know statistically when it comes to life insurance and protecting your family that women are more likely to be uninsured or under insured than men this doesn't make any sense women make up half the workforce contributes mightily to family incomes\nUh read our regional and I'm a community banks in our area we do business with several banks\nAnd so and it's very simple it's just because I Need to pick up the phone and talk to a human being that actually has a little bit of power that can pull stuff off now I don't my CFO does but my controller knows that kind of thing but but in you know that's what you should want you should be able to walk in and talk to a human and not be treated like a number\nAnd you know I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America it's beyond me\nThey treat you like crap and they over charging for most of the services and this day and time their online offerings of their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated they're not that good\nThey're not good at anything so I just don't get it so that that's why we endorse credit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank and I'm just a\nA huge fan of using that for your ah your banking service needs and it's what I did\nEverything I endorse on the show is stuff that that I personally do or what do you know in your situation I kind of a thing I don't have anything is inconsistent like I'm too big or too good to do that I I'm not I don't have a need for some of the things that we tell ya get but\nYou know ... you know in most cases I'm a customer personally Ted is with us Ted's in York, Pennsylvania Hi Chet how are you\nI'm doing better than I deserve how're you doing just the same how can I help\n[noise] alright well thank you and your staff or you're doing it's a blessing thank you um how will be needing a lakeside saving operation about ten to Fifteen Years I don't get hit by a bus [laughter]\nAnd I want to know if I if I should continue funding and ha with my employer contributing a couple of hundred bucks a year or should I just put that extra money into a Roth IRA her four one K.\nWas it just a couple of hundred bucks a year the company I don't know who you can put you come out they're matching a couple of hundred bucks a year in more okay so\nThe the nature of ... what kind of life saving operation if you've got to have in ten years what is it\nBy needle ever ooh I got home yes see so you know fortunately is something you can't live without\nYeah I've heard that you know our K hobby I'd say it's a it's a slow a slow progression then\nYeah it is they they asked a mate that you know Seventeen years out south okay yeah I got to right around the time I'm going to retire so I'm trying to retire early you know and I'll see if I can\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're gonna want is a mix you you you you got to have the cash in your age or somewhere else in an investment to cover what's going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking to health insurance is going to cover a large portion of this correct\nYeah that if I don't retire um and I'll be on um either ... or some other type of insurance policy\nYeah I think I'd be on cobra or or I wouldn't retire because this is I guess this is a multi hundred thousand dollar event isn't it\nI'm thinking we're going to turn retirement around this a little bit um or and or cobra one of the two if you want to retire early you're just going to have to pony up for the cobra but the cover only last for two years or something\nUm I don't know if you can keep that indefinitely so I think that's number one I Want to make sure you got health insurance to cover the vast majority of those I don't want to\nTime that poorly a but then how much have you got coming out of pocket a over ten years you can put five thousand dollars a year into that age essay or whatever your big the duck double is what your doctor will\n[noise] um [noise] ... yeah ... or ... whatever the ... on the ... year\nOh out the H I say that health insurance uh amount of fun you\nKnow the ... or health savings account that is attached to a health and ... say health insurance policy that as a ... policy\nIt depends uh depends on the ... either six to nine nine thousand\nDollars is what I'm Talking about you can put up to that amount per year into that savings account\nThat would be six thousand yeah yeah I Wish I'd probably from that yes but I don't touch it until I you know\nThere yes here's why so when you're when you need the money out of pocket to cover the whatever comes out of pocket on on the liver surgery a and you keep\nYour health insurance in place and you've got this big juicy health savings accounts sitting there in and use mutual funds in it and I let it grow over the next ten years be as big as a ... there's no downside of that whatever you don't need\nFor the liver transplant or liver trans whatever the processors they're whatever you don't need you can pull out and just pay taxes on it no penalties\nAt sixty five and so um you're going to build that up and you just not going to it becomes over what you don't use you can use for

and when I Need a radio with the best reception an audio simply turned to see crane you can trust them with everything the CBC Radio too we\nHappens to be one of the best team in FM radios me today and with the two we can hear our show with better clarity designed to receive long range of human FM stations and make\nThose weak signals stronger the high quality audio from the CBC Radio too we can be adjusted for ... per boys clarity and good musical performance to radio is also widely in a crisis situation\nBelieve me the two we has the weather alerts and during the weather related emergency

reliable crush towns communications throughout many areas in the U.S making it ideal for emergency communications well it also has some course\nOne of the great things about the crane a free catalog take advantage of it some get information about the CBC Radio too we in the new and you will see crane catalog by calling she created one eight hundred five two to eight eight six three that's one eight hundred five to two eighty six three or go to see crane\n... they're not ladies you there's even a game of through now joined called mobile I Know that that's who choose to do the suicide you don't do something the way\nI Know that and they don't commit suicide some of them right\nThey try\nYou know if you think it was I mean I kinda believe technology is working against is like a neutron bomb when a neutron bomb explodes it doesn't make a big explosion but the neutrons penetrate to building an arm or an underground and bunkers and it kills everything from the inside the\nBuilding that left standing perfectly no damage at all\nAnd I believe that's how these demons wanted destruction in any form to any human I mean I mean look at every single country hate each other out there they're ready to bomb each other for almost nothing but anyway it real quick towards my dad moved to New Jersey I think in my career as a special ed teacher\nOr ice that working with kids who didn't have any qualities attributes of characteristic that normal people have this war began to feel like I was blessed George ... ah you had to work with these kids who appreciate that that is when I started trying to pay back\nFor just being normal so I started a prayer life I always had a prayer life when I started to ... held a prerequisite for white had this ...\nI mean his four kids that have nothing going from I even had some kids in my classes\nHad these terrible Kansas and I would draw for them and they always they want the joy so that would give them like coloring books in crayon and they would try so hard to keep those those those are cut that the ... in in the lines are with the numbers more\nBut some of them had says terrible it's your Kansas that they would rule follow in your own coloring they withdrew in ...\nWas in school you were at\nI was just it was ... yeah I was a special ed teacher had different classes you know and just happened to be in these classes it was it shows in like that okay I but I Will be cleaned it up for them it was nothing to rule because they did that all day long so that they didn't mean anything to them\nEr and er so yeah the anti but you know what they learned a skill that they were never going to use or you know there was no really cure for them back to and even today just really no cure\nSo as a special ed teacher had a lot of time in my hand and the kids need to two hours for lunch for the teacher said would help feed them uh there's no papers to correct\nThe bigger kids ahead in the ... in the room used to move back as long as I enrolled us\nYou know when you see a tractor trailer pull up to a warehouse and they put out there was a sign roles and put the boxes on him to shut them down and\nYou know there's a lot of them don't you know\nYeah so this is me this school supply\nI enrolled us in my class sideline up the kids\nI think until it can get a box but it on the island while he was flooded out to the next kid they because they would open it up to slide it down to the next year they put something in and slide down to the next just tape it you know so that's what they did so I had plenty of time so George I know how to Boston so I said Boston to the nightclubs and I believe this is a real prerequisite of what why they steam and came to this house\nWe doing two jobs John\nI mean I did that thing is special ed teacher didn't take up much of my time at a two hour lines I didn't have papers to correct you know so I decided you know it gets going to do this too so um yeah so uh uh ... you know people at night\nI Know a lot of 'em real stand the people but there was a certain percentage of people who doubt no doubt darkest side of things these people are like little wicked have looking\nFor across the alcohol and drugs are committed adultery anything they can get their hands on and the good pushing these people were atheist or they went to the cost a little bit\nMake sure I can get along with anybody I can relate to anybody and this type of behaviors enemy bobbing factor but you went over the years I noticed that a lot of these people die from accidents like car accidents overdoses suicide cancers and [noise] and I bought it with these people in the ... and I knew them you know\nUp and I felt that these people like ships in the night without a rather any way they\nWould take a million ... or the wind was blowing that was fine with them and they died a state that I thought nobody should die\nThen we're the last race unusually high yeah\nUnbelievable and so um you know I just didn't think they knew how to live I mean that's another thing is focused on the teacher had us if you get a nose I self you know knows I mean is it or not trying to be somebody else knowing that means do me the truth about you\nYou are what you do look at what you have to analyze what you do then analyze what you believe about yourself you might find it completely different person here I mean I had one friend I Try to get through this quick because I Know we want to get into the uh his name is Chris he was the boss and he worked right alongside he was an atheist than there used to make fun of God used to make fun of you just used to make fun of the Virgin Mary\nAnd he smoked and drank every night seven nights a week\nHe didn't feel well they went to visit a doctor and he found he already had four states can't oh so he couldn't work anymore so I tried to visit in between my you know gone from school my school job and my nights off [noise] ah we work together I mean it was like a friend you know I Know you had all these problems but\nYou didn't know what\nI Know he had this for about forty years in a in a few months and he died within a few months but I went to visit them and I would try to talk to him about God but he wasn't interested at all he was even more bitten out George because of the diagnosis he had died he died in such a terrible state he died in the state and I want you to die and\nUh I I felt like helpless form now in my religion judgments that people fall into hell like snowflakes from the sky especially if there's no one to pray for them\nSo I started praying for him and all these other people that I knew and bonded with and they felt they were friends of mine and I would ask God you know don't send these cells to hell that unless you go to hell until I finished praying for them\nNo matter how long God gives me on this planet no matter how many grains of sand they still got left an hourglass that's what I was going to do and I believe now there was a prerequisite of why this human creature compelled to assess my house and I'll build up most of your piece by piece right down to every single detail\nNo object what we can really will let me ask you this little job to do this demon follow you to the house basically or was it already there\nAbsolutely not absolutely not George I've never had like a and I've never you\nKnow I never had ... invited to speak\nTo here I never had to say on I never use a week he poured more and I never use terror card I mean I I Believe that opens the door for creature like just to come in and I don't think anybody does that because\nNow I think if you are allowed to speak to come in and he'll do harm I think if admitting him to do is worse than any other time they had\nNo there's no doubt if you if you invited in each call me\nYeah that's what I Believe now but you do is\nAbsolutely not dressed I've learned a lot from it I learned that it is and has a methodology to discuss that too but the other really other time [noise] ah well you know I told her I worked in Michael that's why I wrote that book anyhow that's the best selling book and then if you're interested in any of that do have some funny stories about the rapper Chris\nBrown and that's that's the topic we don't touch we don't last which we don't we don't get into that topic oh okay [laughter] [noise] so anyway\nPeople probably want you to was basically what you've seen on the outside but go ahead\nYeah OK study on the other time that I ever\nKnew about a person who encountered the demon that I Believe was because my brother or brother Paul he we had just a rare a blood disease that runs in the family and my my dad was unfortunate to get it and it kills them very early in the sixties had a heart attack and he died at the same day I'd rather it was unfortunate for you to get it\nAre you OK gets it excuse me are you are right\nYet what with the blood disease oh I haven't\nI haven't checked with that yeah oh yeah or the doctor who well let me tell you what happened to fall in I'll tell you\nSo poorly breaks up and he has the same symptoms my dad had chest than say dollars nine one one they can they come and they take 'em to the hospital and at the hospital\nHe dies on a hospital bed and when I went to visit them later on he says to me Johnny you know and I heard that he died on hospital bed that's what the doctors told me said Johnny when I died on a hospital bed I left my body\nHe said I left my body and I watched that doctors frantically and then they're trying to get me back to life again if they'd be late and not on comedy and yeah\nAnd uh alarms going off and said I can I talk about that fifth\nFifth dimension that spiritual dimension he step into that for him and he was still so he's still thought he was in a hospital room because he could see what was going on with his body they said in the hospital\nHe said to me ... ... and it and then there was a dark side of that room he said and demons came from a small team is not like big when factory for for for toys I came to me\nAnd it was grabbed me and was starting to pull me answer that talk area of the room which I which I says to because they are they overlap some types and I believe that's where we left him\nAt fifth dimension and ah they were dragging him into that talks romance and they finally got back to life he was able to get back into his body\nAnd he said to me Johnny why didn't demons come I'm not really that big of a person he said you know I don't understand ... why would even come to me and I was like boy I really don't know uh I don't know if anybody but no I Know that you know all of us are raised the same way like I said you know I've got a religion ... confirmed enough religion\nHe was still but he dropped out and ... to go to church anymore okay he met a woman he didn't really marry just live what okay again I tell them you know you got kids that you never gave them a religion can anyone you can't even ... one one prayer\nMaybe it's probably not\nWell I well I don't know maybe get a big kick in your but sometimes when you when your passion to the fifth dimension you know that that we're at overlap somehow\nOn John we're in a break but we'll come back and talk more [noise]\nThe ... voices read news if you're ... if we want to enjoy your website on your boom will just go to see 'em dot com on

devil has approached you were going to ... you can join let's pick up the story about your brother you you'll brother is a time what happened\nYeah so I'm just to recap uh I mean this is probably the only other time I've ever had an encounter with a devil that I Believe that you know I Know my brother wouldn't lie to me about it\nAnd he wasn't really a bad person I mean he left his religion like we talk and then he he lived with the woman who didn't get married to him in his case they didn't have a religion so\nUh you know I felt that made me but he said you know to me you know when I died on that hospital that I left my body I watched the doctors frantically\nTrying to get me back to life again with the fifty ladies and the nurses running back and forth sticking things my aunt and they could hear the alarms going off it was but he wasn't like that they mentioned that overlapping to mention I guess\nAnd he said it was like a duck part of that room which probably never was there when he was in the hospital but when he was in that overlapping mentioned that he said David Kang for him and he actually ... demons count man I was like really don't know why\nWhy you know I just don't know how to explain that either I I never had this problem I never had a problem like this before uh before I had this operation in my house but ah I Wonder about it a lot but he's a a like a completely one hundred and eighty degrees turn man he's a very religious and now\nThis experience scared the heck on moving\nA can of\nIt but I Believe it I mean to actually be dying dying and then you know leave your body that something is going to remember you're still young guys only like forty years always got a lot of life ahead of it but he now has a very religious person but uh\nBeing out of this statement but the one that I can see with a very different like I tell you that the ...\nYou know what was the first episode for huge on this demon showed up what\nThey all K so uh let me explain to I live in New Jersey like the middle of New Jersey right in the ... area I have a house that's on like an acre property\nSo far how far Hoboken or you\nVote for far from there is a good hour though oh are you from hulk Hogan and no\nNo so natural was oh\nOh yeah that was born in Brooklyn that far from home\nBut now I live in New Jersey so oh yeah so I just wanted to say because I had a best selling book I was able to retire and I didn't have to work with those I Love the skits believe me but I ... I I stopped working but may not have to work at ... I guess you just stop\nAnd I stopped ... are sending at night and I love bartending at night but er and that but I stopped but I still know about those people that feel sorry for those people and that's a big ... big prerequisite of why I had to separate but now I'm In New Jersey now so I'm doing fine you I have a very uh elaborate for life\nUh I I retired from my by my job as a special ed teacher retires to not working at night and I miss those people a lot too\nAnd I have this nice house and it's like ... okay\nAbout a hundred and fifty feet from the street is on a hill you come in to the house and the the garages are under the house and you fill your car into the left and you go into the garage and in the back door did it come into the garage and then between the garage George and the basement is this big indoor\nAnd other ... I had three boys here growing up and as it got a little bit bigger they wander a little more room so I had a basement finished and uh I cut it in half and it had an apartment building down there so my first wife that's all that he wants to more space that he moved down there yeah you have your own interests\nYou pull your aunts come and go as you want to say yes\nYes it was nice so then he goes to college and he looks out second boy watch the army so he takes it he goes to college and moved out by third boy he watched that a farm and he was he was in there he he was here this whole time so he uh when I had\nThe he was the smart one free rent\n[laughter] yeah well I didn't mind you we have this big house and then like when he ... he went to college he moved out but he got a job\nAnd then he said you know can I moved back home I just want to set my own business as they come back home because I mean we got its big house and my wife has this empty nest syndrome sure you know what I mean so I I like having a ... a company to somebody to come upstairs and have dinner with you once in a while and when you saw him he wasn't home that much but he's moved out since then he got a great orphanage took it but anyway he's here the whole time\nSo that stuff there and so in the basement you come in that that I enjoy just step back up to the kitchen\n... in the okay if you're in that case and you can almost hear that or an enclosed and the next to the kitchen is living well and that's why it most of the time George and uh that's what I like I\nI go to the gym in the morning to meditate and they have to know what I meditating at night and meditate so I have a pretty long for life but I took I did get back to my artwork because I Am good at that as a small little town that God gave me you know so uh I'm doing that and everything is fine to it for years and I've been praying for the last so that I felt well last those\nEvery day for years and I was like I said I'm going to do that to whatever time I have left here so everything's fine\nUh and then a bank yeah\nSo then yeah I think I'm sitting in the liver\nYes the earth by myself and I hear that I enjoy ... slam lucky you normally wouldn't even hear it from in the in the living room but I hear a slam like it never was slammed before and I'm thinking to myself\nAnd you know somebody's open\nOh absolutely you in the house at twenty five years you know every noise in the house you know\nSo I'm thinking to myself what what's out there but I don't think my wife could even if he came home and sleep like I don't even think she gave him slam that do it that hard\nAnd maybe my son can I don't know why he would do it unless you had a car accident or with a girlfriend broke up with them or something like that so I'm thinking what is that I get up I go to the kitchen I look downstairs usually when somebody comes in down near the puts up with in a lifetime still talk to you so I go into\n... and I have a a surveillance system here right they look into the cameras and they roll back the cameras ten Fifteen twenty minutes I said nobody was on the property I look at the cameras has faced the garage doors nobody nobody open those garage doors I look at the camera the faces that store in the back nobody went through the\nBackdoor and or what you what you distinctly heard it all\nOh absolutely slam no\nLike slant I didn't know at at the time that we're going to discuss this creature was using his methodology on me and had a method it wasn't it was telling me that wasn't here for social call that wasn't passenger with\nNow explain that in a minute so I go I look in the cameras nobody was on a property in the basement I got I got bars on windows but you can get out as a you know if there was a fire in the house he just on lock them and jumped out too so I Know he couldn't get anybody if somebody was trespassing I couldn't see them so I go say turn the lights on in the basement and I go down to the basement\nAnd it's not looking everywhere\nAnd you you're pretty convince you think somebody's in the house don't you\nOh absolutely absolutely but I the only problem is but when I'm looking around I feel like I've been in the past twenty five years I feel this menacing sinister I'm In is like the only word to describe this like evil like an evil\nJust the name ... yeah\nLooking everywhere I look under the steps and like any where somebody could squeeze himself into behind a washer and dryer in my son's room under the bed in his closet you know and the furnished room I look I look at my frantic look and I still have this horrible feeling\n[noise] so I'm thinking well I I Know I looked at some satisfy looked into the cameras nobody came and nobody broke in but I still have this really menacing finished the feeling that come upstairs and they sit down\nAnd I'm thinking about it and then I you know and then all of a sudden I hear\nThis wedding steps between the basement and and and and the kitchen and here's something I really heavy because like I could hear when my wife comes up the steps a hundred and twenty pounds my son comes up to a hundred and Seventy pounds I Know what those steps down like where you get something very silly crushing they'll step\nAnd thinking to myself I just shut down here you know nothing was here\n... coming up to ... [noise]\nYeah I feel something very heavy slowly coming up the stuff I get up again I go over that I looked at nobody there so I'm thinking\nWe were you harmed her own armed at this time\nI had I have a a registered gun you know you do okay [laughter]\nBut I but I didn't see anything so you know what I mean I looked in the cameras that look through the cat was if I were to fill us something then I I I didn't feel like a you know and I don't think I I kinda was wondering if because I had that feeling of something very menacing sinister\nAnd I think it is but could this possibly the but then I tried to shake it off because he like I'm just the guy I don't think that's you know it's\nGoing to ask what John where are you convinced that there was this creature demon in the house\nOr when it actually I actually had the ... but I Want to try to build up to that before actually tell\nYou we're running out of time so we're going to get some really\nCBS tonight do miss new comedy ... first

suffers the right word but we put up with\nA problems in our guts this is certainly going to be if it's true that is something that may impede people will be interested are excited about going into deep space\nUh for either business or pleasure but keeping it back here\nOn earth there are a lot of people and I am one of them are who has problems and maybe this is too much information but we all have and why can't we talk about it I mean I think that's one of the important things got microbial imbalance comes\nAbout as a result of a you know maybe eating the right things you got to a number of reasons that this could are presented so let's get Dr ... women's health expert on with us to talk about unhappy gut oh you don't have a doctor more\nNo my I have one of those iron got your hairline out that if there's anything wrong with my stomach I'm either ... or a really\nAn a ha ha well and are now planning to be pregnant again any time soon [laughter] All right\nSo you and you have all the tools to keep yourself healthy so what do people need to know about a guy BS irritable bowel syndrome and if it I guess there's a terminology that goes with ideas be which is really a combo of her irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea\nAnd not pleasant but something a lot of people have so what are we what causes it and how do we get over the pain the cramping the gas the loading\nA that's a great question I think the most important thing people need to know is what is it so ideas day is a form of irritable bowel syndrome that not only characterized by diarrhea but it's a very unpredictable type of diarrhea if you have the stomach flu for example you know that\nYou know you were a hundred percent well one day and then the next day you were sick and you know that you'll probably be sick for about seven days and then it done here you'd never know when it's going to come back you don't know how long it's going to laugh\nAnd you don't know when you're going to be struck with this incredible urgency that you have to go to the bathroom and if you don't get there right away you might have a very embarrassing accident\nOn it is characterized also as you said by cramping and gas and bloating\nAs well but the unpredictable nature and this urgency are really the hallmarks of it I don't want anybody listening to be sitting around thinking that they have to make their own diagnosis of course if you have any kind of balance problems\nYour job is to make a phone call and make an appointment to the health care provider that as your doctor's job to figure out

like it it really it it could make a real difference and instead what it's turning into is here's a tool for Democrats used to destroy people's lives which is an awful outcome where what a great outcome would be out of this in my opinion is that going forward or people like Phyllis\nWould would be believed would at least be taken seriously enough hand you've taken seriously believe that they have the evidence taken seriously and and and and and would not fear coming out because if you had a evidence and you had a a real story to tell it would be ... correct\nAnd that's that's that is the outcome that I think rational Americans are looking for them they want this to and they think this is horrible\nBut they don't want to go the other way this has become um a vendetta you know fill us

stick around for that for clock Congressman Paul gross or be live in the studio eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one right that number down we'll take your life calls um but I Want to talk about change directions here\nBeen talking a lot about northern Arizona university and some of these very large real estate purchases that they've been making you got to keep in mind the ... the three universities in Arizona I mean this is this is big business\nThis is hundreds and hundreds of millions billions of dollars in business I mean it's ten plus thousand dollars a year just to go there plus everything else it's it's big business and a lot of people rely on the the jobs\nAre there's a lot of people that come from out of state and in Flagstaff you've seen a lot of people come from out of state out of town who have moved to this community in a town that has\nAnd Jerry neighbors but it very well the other day uh you know we always used to be kind of a ... we were a town with the University in it and there was that kind of area back there behind ... depends on how long you been here but behind target or going way back behind ... I mean you'd have to go way back\nIn any that's back there so it kind of out of mind out of sight\nAnd the reason why I've been kind of harping on this a little more than usual ... let me let me step back I'm a I have been a big supporter of northern Arizona university I think by and large they obviously do a lot for the economy in Flagstaff in northern Arizona a lot\nThere's a lot of job activity I don't know something like one in six jobs are related to any you in some way that's the last study I saw so I don't discount that [noise]\nBut folks like me and I and I watch Jerry neighbors who has been a a huge supporter of any you he he was really a a lightning rod I'm for that relationship that go between while he was mayor of Flagstaff you may not know this\nAnd he actually he stood up pretty hardcore for president Rita Chang there and in the beginning and that's just a little back story he he he won't say it but I Will\nBut the question comes up now is why as any you\nKind of pushing their interface\nInto the heart of the city now if you're outside of Flagstaff you should be familiar with like stuff I'm sure there's ... avenue\nThat's like the main drag I Seventeen\nEnds and turns into Milton avenue to busy busy street there's big huge student developments going up there uh there's there's a lot of commercial activity a very busy street and if you've if you've been ah up to Flagstaff skiing you know what I'm Talking about 'cause you're going to sit in traffic for a long time but what's different here\nAnd why I'm pointing this out and why I'm going to continue to push on this issue\nBut remember I'm I'm just kind of a conduit for some folks in the community who maybe are thinking the same things and and I'd love your thoughts if you're thinking the same things\nUm which is traditionally any use out of mind out of sight and back their right but now it's in are facing rate on ... avenue and they have two major land purchases\nWhich to me are huge purchases you know to a a six hundred million dollar organization or whatever they are are in a in a multibillion dollar a business through throughout the state of Arizona for the three universities you don't maybe twelve Thirteen million dollars is chump change I don't know\nI don't know I Know that there's a lot of kids you know to spend a lot of money I shouldn't say kids a lot of folks that spend a lot of money to go to these universities and the average debt ah is somewhere around Thirteen fourteen thousand when they come out that's for any you know\nSo it is big money and what's different here is\nThe enemy you now with this property these two big purchases right on Milton we'll be right there right in your face no longer back kind of behind everything back there\nThere is right in your face that's what's got people perking up and saying wait a second what's going on here now I have invited and there is an open invitation to president ... come on the program and talk about this\nBecause it is our community and and this is a city where should have a university within it now the university what the city in it\nAnd when it I'm not opposed to the university grown don't get me wrong I I think we have to talk about some of those gross levels because you're talking about thirty thirty three thousand students in his in the city of Seventy thousand there there needs to be that discussion about that\nBut I think that President change come on the show and and and talk to all of you talk to me while I'm a good conversation about that gross and about this new\nPush this new direction which is any you write in your face on mountain avenue I think that's what's raising a lot of folks uh intent I and I love your thoughts eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one so I Will remain optimistic and keep the invitation out for president Chang come on the program\nHowever uh I'll just at this point it's assumed that she's not coming on and my question is I'm going to pose some public questions for the university over the coming days and weeks\nMy question is this real simple what's the plan for these two prime Milton avenue frontage parcels in Flagstaff you're spending twelve Thirteen million dollars then you still got to spend hundreds and hundreds of thousands demo into buildings then I assume you're going to build something\nWhat are you going to build their I think the community because you are taking a piece of city property that normally is on the county ... no I'm not a big fan of property taxes but the reality is once you purchase these multi million dollar properties and they use and owns them and they're no longer part of that\nTax role and they're no longer as best I Know and this would be another question I have\nA for the president President Chang they're no longer subject to the city of five steps you know laws rules regulations as far as building codes things like that that's my understanding\nSo it's basically an explanation of property from the city although ironically the folks that if you if you did and I'm not saying they are but if they did housing there those folks could vote on city elections that's kind of a the ironic part of this\nSo anyway I think president trying the reason why I'm asking these questions is because the community is asking these questions and there was maybe a group that was kinda you know yelling things recently and over the past years about the growth of any you and what it means to community but now I'm hearing it from your traditional supporters\nAnd even people like former slice of mayor Jerry neighbors who was a big supporter but people traditionally have supported you are just asking the question what's going on here and I think they deserve an answer so my question would be\nA year you're buying these properties right along the busy court or what's your plan what's your plan\nMy question would be a year you're buying these properties right along the busy court or what's your plan what's your plan because in one hand I'm saying I'm hearing well we don't have a very definitive plan\nAnd\nI have a quote here or from or any you this was this was reported in the Arizona daily sun last month a president change or believe chief of staff joined keen quote so this would be a primary for any you to have access to the campus so they're talking about making that kind of\nI I think it's probably going to be a grand entrance because they really don't have an entrance other than a ... or the southern insurance right now but then the quote goes on we really see this as a big benefit benefit for campus to put up some signage so they want him ... potential act but then they go on potential academic\nSpace administrative space\nSo that's what was said last month this prime piece of property\nGive yourself an extra tree with your likes getting cast a price on the top at all like you can eat practice

conscious of the conservative\nSo last time I had him on um I just think quite frankly I just didn't call after that I just couldn't do it I was just on 'em but what's going on here I mean you have everybody knows this is going to be you've been in politics for a little while I was in the city council and and you always know\nWhen you put out a position near the I'm sure a guy named forty seven others\nAre or forty eight are like no I I'm good I'm voting for Kavanaugh and three or the ... once they got to know they've been in this long enough Collins and Murkowski they're that they're going to get clobbered\nAnd they're going to be protests like there weren't front and center flakes office in Phoenix yesterday um why do they do this what what where do you think that if it's going to be our our senator from\nArizona well here's the deal you you mentioned it earlier is that you have to be a hundred percent with these people otherwise they're never your friend so Murkowski and and and a flake a and Collins\nI mean look John McCain look at the experiment called John McCain you know when he ran for president he was shredded by the progress is by the Democrats are Disney yup but once he dies and he was a thorn in the Republican all we're in ... he he's a stand up kind of guy but they're never going to be your friend\nSo if you're talking about one running in the election or running for election you made your base and so you better than\nThat make them happy and\nSo if you're talking about one running in the election or running for election you made your base and so you better\nMake that make them happy and you better make the constitution happy and you better make sure that the rule of law is is held the standard and then I'm going to a hundred and forty years and it's been a success story\nBut we're person who's right we're we're we're turning a corner yeah I agree though last week ago right we can store or the strongest place in the world but if we don't have the rule of law well don't take very long before those lights are out yet rule of law over all of\nMan somebody just deciding yep this is this what we're doing today yeah that's why we have that piece of paper seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety someone here with Congressman Paul ghosts are a lot of folks want to change its own I've seen it here in northern Arizona\nUm sometimes I Wonder you know my listeners who are in other cities in Prescott and and very valley in wherever I talk about ... because I see the stuff happening here that we see and the other big cities the San Francisco's of New York's\nBut there's there's been this push a to change the ... they want to change the constitution in particular they want\nTo have the open border if they want people flooding over there's been this push we've got one council member here in Flagstaff are against women have put some of the shows up in a meeting on the dioceses there with a sign that says a hash tag abolish ice God David Garcia is running for governor or he's on that bandwagon as far as I Know is well\nThere's a lot of there's folks in that that are in Congress and oh yeah I'm sure Oh absolutely what's what's the plan here what I mean what are they thinking\nAnd also where are we in transition to the border where are we with our border\nWhere it was ... you know you already see I I take a counter steps but obviously they don't care about the safety of the American people because I ... a ... ... tons of of illegal drugs I got one of my pilot for no I mean right now what they've done with that no a little ... on\nThe streets could kill hundreds of thousands in close to a million people with what they've confiscated and obviously they don't care about human trafficking and women trapping particularly women and children obviously they don't they don't care about that either because ISIS one of the premier interceptors of a a trafficking human human ... ah people\nThat's the problem is is you know once again it\nComes back to it at a verse that I've I've memorized and it was from Louis Brandeis who's an associate a Supreme Court justice a government of laws is imperiled if it doesn't hold the laws screw a uphold the law scrupulously\nIt if it doesn't it empowers every room to be a law breaking in by ... anarchy here's our sign I mean this is the ... you know a clip from the blue\nComedy tour look at George Soros is pouring\nIn this country for the anarchy he won't say where world government so I mean folks I mean this this is here right now in here and it is at our doorstep and prevails when good people do nothing that is the key that is a key\nScary times it's scary times and I think you're right\nAround that corner so scary times but you know what I'm a our freedoms and liberties are not free will have to fight for them day in and day out must give a little bit away\nAnd that takes the ... the a general media mhm outside of Fox and so what ends up happening you look at all the times that he gets a rare bonds Ninety over Ninety percent of almost every other uh channel or a national media source is anti Trump\nAnd in part of the reason is is that how bird guy come out of the clear blue never being a candidate before making promises and actually ... promises contradicting what lifelong bureaucrats and ... and a politician's headquarters\nBut never did that torture after here is you're breaking down the and the elite in this country\nIn regards to politics but when you were you on the male and you've got a guy that just keeps on ticket he we we knew we don't need somebody to slip away from from the fight we need somebody to put the box and gross to Boston Globe given the boxing ring and start putting people back\n... it's time's up um we got to stand our ground make sure the facts are there and then debate those facts but stand our ground water fighter they don't have to always agree\nWith him and but they want a fighter and Jason great comment and he also mentioned you know he felt that this started under Rocco bomb and now I was not happy for eight years now but I just\nI'm not saying that there was never cases of people that got kooky and did things and you know what I'm saying but this level and I I it drives me crazy when liberals argue that this is what happened under Obama no way really no way but here's the facts\nSo under block Obama you had fast and furious operation choke point where we went after the second amendment\nThat's the only way people can hold a government out of control accountable\nAnd when we saw in ...\nFurious operation choke point where we went after the second amendment that's the only way people can hold a government out of control accountable and then we saw in ... where there was a lack of accountability once again you're going to see a ... a ... a whole a entourage of things that break down the culture of this country\nWe knew was going to happen they'll do intervene did let anybody intervene and left a crime scene to be contaminated\nDidn't hear the IRS where oh my God you're guilty to improve yourself innocent the attack of the government against a citizen oh my lord\nWhen we start seeing the attack on the press with James Rosen ... and then we'll andme asking this was the rivalry of breaking down civil society\nAnd you're seeing it right now with the ... a salacious in and verify does see that's why we're so poignant about making sure that they weren't the uh Seventy two words are shown further spoke to the American people to show how dangerous is is\nBecause you become a number if the government can give you everything they can also take it away yeah Joseph Stalin Mao I mean you don't have to do a very far north of Venezuela's going on right now\nThis is what you want that's not what I Want that's not what I see what my family that I Want them to have the opportunity to move forward to make their lives better now you don't have to win but you can always have another chance I think he\nComes and goes I Know the problem though is\nThat what we have to do is educate folks because they don't ... they don't remember that history I'm not saying I remember history from a hundred years ago but you read the history you know the history you know what I'm saying and they don't remember that history now when you're just saying all those things from the Obama administration there was\nYou know it's like a ... a bad flashback because I've got about a lot of those but then you start talking about the the horrors of past socialist regimes\nAnd now you see socialism cool you know you see that you see the statistics look young people\nI Know they have a\nWhat it is I Know you know it's just something that's in bad\nAnd and and and it also tells you how sad our educational system is\nWhere we're tearing down our history well that's the first thing that Stalin did that Hitler did that now did you take away someone's history whether it's good or bad you learned from that we're human beings and when you look at the civil or you know a a a monument from the civil war\nDoesn't have to be that they stood for something right but it's something that we write is a wrong it's history it's just you absolutely but but once again\nYou've seen it in the past\nUh regimes like mowing Hitler and and solid remove that history so people have nowhere to go back to\nIt's interesting you mention the history because just yesterday I was talking about um ... Columbus Day coming up\nAnd there's there's no shortage and people's ... exactly yeah and you read that and you've you've heard about it and my point is been look I have no problem with having indigenous peoples they have no problem I'm Columbus Day there's a whole history that we have to recognize the bad things that happened but the good things that happen as well right because there's a whole history behind all of that absolutely\nI I I Hope folks can look at that but I'm seeing I in my ... year congressman I've got a you know thirty percent something like thirty only thirty percent of ... and even even pass the citizenship test it's a multiple choice thing no one else is there any new Ben Franklin is yeah he invented the light bulb they say\nYou know seriously seriously uh\nAll right let's do this I Want to ...
