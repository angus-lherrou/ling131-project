not three earn Fifteen\nWe'll see how they really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these\nBig experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of you know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and I was sitting there trying to figure out how to do this in a workshop\nBecause this is back in two thousand and eight and then I wasn't I hadn't really\nMany workshops before you know I'm an investigative reporter by training that's where I used to bust baby selling rings when I was you know young so um\nSo I I Will kiss around this with my husband and I'm sort of saying well I don't know maybe I'll just put people in groups of eight and or so and have them send healing intention to each other and he's a good headline writer and he said yeah I Love it the power of eight\nSo it came about totally by accident we put people in groups of eight in our workshop\nFirst one we ran in Chicago I\nI was kind of I I knew how to do intention I studied it within tension masters I'd put together a program I'd looked at what worked in scientific in the scientific lab but I wasn't sure about these small groups should they hold hands when Jimmy do so I'm I'm kind of making it up as I go along\nAnd the next day I figured I'd I have him come back the next day and tell us what happened and I had all the groups send intention to somebody in the group with some sort of health challenge and when they came back I assume they were going to tell me it's\nIt's kind of like having a facial or getting back rub do you know nice little feel good effect that isn't what happened what happened is stuff like this they lined up I gave them the Mike in turn and they said things like\nI have cataracts and their eighty percent better\nI'm due for a knee replacement my knees completely messed up and I'm walking normally today\nAnd I can do deep squats I have terrible insomnia and I set up like a baby last night you know and on and on it went like that total instant healing and I was completely shocked because as I said I'm\nYou know I I look at things as a journalist I look at things I Try to look at the science of things are trying to prove things and this was completely out of ...\nSo I didn't believe it I like to be honest George I thought it was a placebo effect but then it started happening over and over and over I mean I've run hundreds of these things and I've had people where their\nTheir arm is dislocated and its slots back into place during the intention or somebody who had couldn't see well because she had a stroke and her eyes went back to normal\nSomebody was ... who went completely out of pain and within you know a month or so were daughter wrote me to say that her back straight and so much they had to change the rearview mirror for car\nYou stories like this over and over again and the same thing going on with some of the centers to and that was the thing that really was amazing\nTo tell me about some show how how powerful mostly be and then what was happening to them\nWill their ordinary people this is the amazing thing of it George we all have this power this is our birthright it's just we don't notice we don't know how to use it we don't realize it amplifies in a group [noise]\nLet me tell you about the story of West with when I met him I put together a couple of groups at the mile high church in Denver just as kind of\nJust as a test this was last ...\nLast last fall and um I ... I wanted to put himself forward he was one of the the initial groups um because he suffered from terrible depression but there was a woman there with stage four cancer Linda and so we\nWe decided to go with her but once had a terrible life he had been a really bright guy in college studying biochemistry wanting to be a doctor and he got a he got called in he had a low lottery number in the very last years of the Vietnam War\nAnd they'd done away with draft deferments for college um college students so he had to go in the last horrible chaotic years of the war\nAnd it was so traumatic for him he came back was really depressed\nAnd that continued in his life even even lost the love of his life too fast growing cancer it was just terrible story so by the time he he got to meeting me he had gone to a point of feeling like what's the use and he was living in a senior facility\nYou barely able to get up and make themselves breakfast in the morning really depressed\nSo he does his intention for Linda [noise]\nAnd then that the next day he told me he\nWoke up and everything had really changed it was almost like he had this amazing heightened sensory awareness you know the grass is greener than it ever been he drank a cup of herbal tea and it knocked his socks off he says\nUm but even more amazing was the next night he had this extraordinary vision on a dream almost like a vision where he was\nBack in college and he met his Nineteen year old self\nAnd this than Nineteen year Old West communicated to him in some way it's all going to be okay there's still plenty of time and\nThat experience to him was so life transforming he's a completely different guy now he is power walking Ninety minutes sees lifting weights he's running group says it's at his church is writing is trying to write again\nHe's doing all kinds of stuff and he had completely given up and that is only one time from being a cinder um and this is a story I hear over and over again where that active being part of this group of being kind of a higher consciousness is life transforming\nWindows the sender need to have any special abilities\n[noise] well here's the really interesting thing of it you know I again did not believe this I was looking at it from every angle um it took me ten years to even get the courage to write this book\nWill say you were the skeptic ... skeptics\nI was I was the ultimate doubting Thomas because as I said I I started the intention experiments because I wasn't I wasn't really sure about all of this\nManifestation law of attraction I didn't I wasn't sure I believed it and I wanted to find out how far can you take it you know are we talking about the shifting a quantum particles are we talking about curing cancer here so um that's what I set up the intention experiments but I never\nI never thought these little groups would have the power but the thing that's so interesting is I had a life universities the largest chiropractic university I'm\nIn the world and they offered to do studies of the power of eight to let their nervous science department look at this so we set up eight groups of students and we\nPut a ... kept to measure the brain waves of\nEach one person one sender in each of the groups\nAnd what we found was so amazing that within a few minutes\nThey would have this completely different brainwave signature it would turn off all the parts of the power vague group would have a quieting of all the parts of the brain that makes us feel separate and also the parts of the brain that make us\nHave worried doubt negativity\nSo these are basically brainwave signatures of somebody who's feeling a sense of ecstatic one this and when we compared these signatures when the nearest scientists who work at the doctor said Stephanie Sullivan um we looked at other things like\nThe work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at the masters and and and Buddhist monks any static\nPrayer they had an identical brainwave signature\nBut the only difference was I had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk or a sushi master mind guys were total novices there were students who never even done meditation and all they had was uh twelve minute video for me\nTo do when we're going to break we're going to come back and just a moment to talk more about your work the power of each and\nSome of the incredible things

to make things happen\nWill that was the interesting thing about this no it doesn't I think what it takes is meeting regularly it it takes some techniques and you know in my book the power of eight I've got all the techniques that people have to to follow to become a really good in tender\nAnd also to intend well in a group but for me the thing the real key element is creating a little group of eight or so and you asked before they have to be a no fiber work\nEleven or work you know eight is kind of a Goldilocks figure you know it's like the not too big not too little um but what's really important is meeting week after week after week and I found that after\nI'm putting people in groups in twenty Fifteen I wanted to do my own experiment because I wanted to see if everything in their lives would begin to heal not just their health\nSo I got a group of two hundred and fifty together and have them you know I taught them for a while and then I put them in groups of eight or so and had the meat every week for a whole year\nAnd it was extraordinary of the people who continued to meet regularly you know every week and that was about a hundred and fifty of them pretty much a hundred percent of them had major life changing experience is so it wasn't just their health\nYou know they got financial windfall or they got amazing new careers or they made up with a strange relatives or you know they got a great new house just the one they wanted\nUm just came out of nowhere or they found a new life purpose but it pretty much everybody had extraordinary stories to tell\nOur ... are are you sure that this works uh primarily from the fuel ... science behind\n[noise] well I think there's a science in the sense that um we did that brainwave study and we found that you know there are major brain changes that go on when you do intention of\nIn a group called ... group prayer in a way I'm In a sense that's what it is it's kind of secular prayer because you have these major changes\nWhich are really very\nVery much similar\nTo somebody having a mystical state you know somebody having a mystical experience people get changed during those kinds of experiences and they allow themselves to be open to a lot of possibilities or they suddenly feel you know\nSomething major his change all their senses are heightened um they feel really optimistic about their future\nAnd so in a way that starts to pave the way if you want to just look at what happens to the individual that paved the way for major changes\nAnd and possibilities but there's something more there's a bigger piece of this George that\nAnd believe me I'm trying to figure out what is it is it a group of fact you know is it just the power of intention but a big piece of this is the power of altruism\nUm that was the big surprise for me because remember the Sanders we're having amazing affects to healing effects\nAnd when I started looking into\nUm the science of altruism it's extraordinary I mean people who do stuff for other people no matter how small live longer are happier are healthier in every regard\nAnd not what we found in a lot of our intention group I mean when I talk about that group and twenty fifth theme that I was studying for a whole year\nI'm One of the people you know there were a couple of people that weren't getting anywhere you know wanted them with a woman called Andy\nAnd Andy was going through a divorce and she had two small kids she needed a new job and she was very talented in marketing and coaching and she just couldn't get anything you know young woman just couldn't get anything and she was just trying everything and\nWe talked with her and tried to work with her and this and that are group tried to work with her and finally I was frustrated by it and I just said oh Andy get off of yourself\nSomeone else and she was one of the people who was intending for that young boy Luke and the moment she did that she gets a coal out of the blue from somebody offering her a dream job so\nCan I tell you any everything about how this works you're absolutely not [laughter] there's complete X factor here I don't understand\nBut there is something about that power of getting off for yourself and doing for someone else that seems to get\nA reward for you which are convinced that word orange\nI Am convinced it works I watch it as I say I sort of look at it almost like a scientist I've looked at\nStudying groups over years\nUm you know I run I run these year long master classes and I'm I'm actually evaluating what's happening to people they're filling out forms every month to say what's changed in their lives\nAnd you know we've done the brain studies were going to do immune systems studies um and just seeing what happens in groups right in front of me you know I Know it works\nOr then others summer when the don't get results in the group\nWill I think it's the people who don't come regularly um sometimes it's nothing to do is skepticism that's the interesting thing too I gave a talk once in in Denver last last year\nAnd there was a woman who had really bad arthritis and she was a total skeptic and she got healed right away like there and um you know we've had people like that who haven't who were a little skeptical really didn't\nYou know sought to themselves yeah right and they had some healing doesn't mean everybody in an audience gets healed but a lot of them you know there's enough to say something really interesting is going on here\nAnd are you interested in the human because it's easier to track in terms of the ...\nOh you mean at physical healing well yeah because it is not easy to ... you know somebody had a condition they don't have the conditions we had a woman was staged for cancer I talked about earlier and she's\nNow you know down to normal numbers now she was doing other stuff too but the intention pushed it right along somebody else with T. M. J. problems those temporary ... joint problems in your job\nAnd uh that she was\nSort of suffering where the pain of eight or nine out of ten and it went immediately down to two and then the pain was gone over days so this kind of thing you know it's\nKind of his heels in an instant or soon after is the thing that you can as you say really track but then you've got other things we're amazing synchronous cities happened you know another woman who was\nTrying to write a book she was a body work um expert Lisa\nAnd she was in one of these year long groups and she was trying to write a book about she figured out a way to treat\nTrauma victims with body work and she wanted to write this book about it she'd never written a book and she was getting no where she had three different editors and just nothing was happening and at the group is intending for nothing was happening and finally once again I simply say\nGet off for yourself and she started it intending to another member of the group who had some ... serious health issues\nAnd again the next week she has she feels compelled to go into a store\nAnd she didn't even need anything at the store and when she gets in there she meets somebody she vaguely\n\n\n\n... financial studios you're listening to Ninety seven point was TV DJ did she lived on the edge northern Arizona is forcing the lady on\n\nThe issues of Fox News alerts trouble with the space launch on jak Callahan Fox News just minutes ago in Kazakhstan a Russian so use ten rocket blasting off all the international space station three two\nOne engines are the problems at the end you lift up\nAnd there is lift awesome diesel use MS ten to the international space station carrying Nick hanging Alexi objection to the orbital complex\nJust minutes into that slight problem developed as the booster rocket apparently did not separate properly moments ago NASA announcing the cruise beginning a maneuver that will return them to worst shortly the crew still in contact with the ground is reported to be okay\nOr getting Michael one of the strongest storms ever to strike the continental United States when it came as you\nOnly two miles below category five strengths\nOnce they do the analysis on the dorm they might bump it up to a category five that is the highest honor five percent of the scale looking at continental US landfall Michael is the fourth strongest by wind one fifty five one fifty six makes it a category five\nThe most intense top three goes down in the history books and we have not yet any ...\nOf us watch meteorologist Janice Dean most of the impacted area was under a dusk to dawn curfew first looks this morning she'll buildings flattened boats blowing ashore school gymnasium roof ripped open like a tin can store and moving through Georgia overnight crossing into South Carolina this morning meteorologist John ... with the national Hurricane Center yet\nThis is from here on out it's going to be very heavy rainfall threat and tropical storm conditions across the southeast state so that's a that's the primary impacts are here we think we do think that all of this will spread offshore into the Atlantic ah by Thursday night and into friday said most of the impact will be felt\nDuring the next twenty four hours south to deaths recorded from the storm this was Fox News [noise]\n[noise] what is this who stars and he got Britain the cannery and we're excited to be a part in Fox Nation because now more than ever we need powerful voice that won't\nBecause now more than ever\nWe need Fox Nation the new and you don't want to know in the past two favorites you already love pack\nBlues and members of the time they're going to be very PC hell no on the sea is more like you can pin you down right but if I may see dot com and find\nChris Wallace from Fox News channel the animating question for me is always going to happen if people's sense that you're not pushing an agenda [noise]\nYou're not holding your punch it they're going to rely on you as a commitment\nOne of the advantages of having been in this business so long you're able to determine\nWhat is real what is important and watched just political\nNoise Griswold some bucks nice gentle real news real honest opinion [noise] recapping\nThis hour's Fox News alert there is apparently a problem all border Russian Soil use ten rocket which blasted off a few minutes ago all the international space station\nFrom the space dome and conflicts dump the former Soviet Union just minutes into the flight a problem developed with the booster rockets a separation\nThe crew on board that soils ten rocket which includes an American astronaut is now a exerting maneuver the should return them to ... on charges have been filed a deadly we get little crash in New York state ...

inherent concert where they have consequences right\nAbsolutely absolutely so it's about really telling the universe what you want I mean I Know that you're a\nA journalist too and so you'll recognize the five W's in age I usually tell people you know what reporters have to learn is when they write a leader of a story they write in in intro they have to do\nWho what when where and why and how\nAnd that's not a bad thing to do when you're formulating an intention\nAnd if a story includes all those ingredients you got a pretty good story\nExactly and for an intention it's the same thing you've got to say what do you want you know the number of people on my master class who will do things like I Want to be rich and you know they don't really want to be rich what they want\nUsually you know in the sense of having loads and loads of money and more stuff what they want is they don't want the job there in what they want is not to worry so much anymore they need a certain amount of money it may not necessarily need to be rich\nUm what they want is more time to spend with their children or grandchildren and so will you have to do is try to figure out first what you want what is that you really want and then tell the universe exactly what you want\nAnd the other thing I noticed George is often times the universe gives us what we need not necessarily what we're trying to say we need like um I have one group one master class a intention group of eight\nAnd they said well were intended for all of us to win the lottery\n[laughter] and I said to them why what do you need and they said well\nGene needs twelve thousand dollars I'm for child and Joan needs another Fifteen thousand dollars to get a car\nAnd so and so needs this and that and I said well why do you intend for the meat individually and ask for what exactly they need because that's probably what the universe is going to give you you know so it's it's really about first of all figuring out what you want exactly\nAnd then telling each of her because when we're on yeah exactly and he was an opportunity for you to talk with blue Mick Jagger the intention will start by going to Thomas a mobile you California Tom\nGeorge thank you for taking my call lamb that's really a pleasure of comment and then a question um I ... just you know your audio watcher programs one called living but fields\nAnd the other one called living with intention and boy those audio compact desks are in constant rotation on my CD player I just want you to know that just have so much information now you see me about\nRetro causality retro in ... and you cite a number of experiments that\nAppear to prove that\nWe can not only in ... for the president but we can chat and for the past that the past is not fixed and stone so to speak that there appears to be worth I experimented proof you cite a lot of researchers\nThere appears to be a robust cross talk between the past and the future and you cite ... how much met a job up here a group in Princeton and each of the experiments that they did that appear to show\nThat you can influence the past that the past is not fixed my question for you can you utilize retro intention retro causality for healing [noise]\nThat's such a great question thank you um yes the answer is the short answer is yes now I Do this all the time in my master classes and workshop some I just ran a retreat in Italy last week and we were doing a lot\nIntention one I tend to do though is you can't change the past of what\nOf what happened in the sense of it happened what you can do though is changed your response to it and going forward and in a way that is part of this whole thing of time being really elastic\nTime being one big smeared out now and that's what the studies you're talking about demonstrate is that you know we what they really show is that and this is a weird thing um\nWe don't change the past we changed the present as it unfolds the future affect the present as it unfolds\nAll the studies show\nBut just to answer your question why tend to do is ask people to go back to a seed moment\nTo moment in their health just when something just started before it blew up to a full blown disease a moment where they first argument argued with somebody in a relationship\nAnd it then deteriorated afterwards just that moment when it started or a moment when somebody told you you weren't good enough as a child or you were terrible at some\nThings we just just did something like that and go back and change your response\nTo that teacher and you say no I'm not used to set math I just don't understand is now I Will later\nSomething like that or imagine that that\nHearing that that illness\nDoesn't blow up into full blown disease I actually had somebody who got ... from an infection go back and imagine that time and I swear to you she told us her skin was starting to re pigment\nIn the workshop it was extraordinary and loads of people where\nThey were they were told something and it's in his sense released it for them going forward so it's an interesting little technique but there's plenty more to mess around with with retro intention because even\nStandard physicist now are saying to us all um\nKnow time is it what we thought it was it's not just for we're going era that we thought from cradle to grave it's much more as I said like one big smeared out now and one big smeared out here for space\nRich in Monterey, California is with us here hey rich go ahead\nYeah they can you hear me don't carry a speaker phone all the good pretty good okay 'cause it's\nKind of hard to hear you I Want to thank you and when\nI'm your conversation is so right on its almost what you have all the time let me give you a a thing um I grew up kind of Catholic and\nI heard the story that you know some people will never die of course Feinstein says energy only changes for them so you know that kind of back me up my whole life so I was a little kid I like to believe all all um I went to karate and learn how to teach and\nIt talks about one percent of the doubt and get your nose broke right 'cause your focus is gone I'm\nI'm divorced from the same life twice I have a daughter she's not talk to make all this stuff happens but I'm such a positive person I knew I Would be sixty one years old not working being taken care of

Want to have a\nA hippie hard center where people just come and visit and we do this ... thing what you're talking about and that just get them to be happy for a minute or a couple of minutes and go

that so many instances killings and I think that it was really shocking to me that\nIt wasn't just health that was healing 'cause you know you could almost explain that by saying well it's the big feel good effect on the immune system things like that\nUm but for instance\nNatalie Lancaster I mean I it was shocking to me cases like this she was one of the receivers in a power of a group and she wanted her intention to be that her family business expand in all directions and be prosperous an old ways and then\nShe and her husband had a computer support in business but it had been built on just two major clients and they were you know they ... they had just heard that one of their two clients was about to take their business elsewhere and they were really worried because\nThey had lost money from a Ponzi scheme about\nA decade before and they had to file for bankruptcy and so she was really frightened that she was going to have to take a job I'm In real estate again flipping houses in order to survive so she can't during the group session she kept visualizing both her and mark\nOpening up their car doors and money spilling out\nAnd afterward her feeling about it for fear and their depression seemed to lift but what was really interesting is opportunities just started opening up for them they suddenly their business received a steady stream of smaller clients and within a few months\nShe they learn not only did that major client decided to stay with them but they completely diversified their client list\nAnd she and her husband had other big opportunities to um she had kind of a certain offers she paints is a hobby and she was a given offers to do her painting and mark was trying to do a sideline business trading folk program that took off\nAnd it was just amazing for her she thought that something about the power of aid group not only perform magic but helped her and her husband trust in self empowerment and the possibility of prosperity\nAnd I think that's what's so incredible for me is to watch everything in people's lives begin to heal\nCan you do develop intention in your dream state\n[laughter] that's a great question I think we are intending in our dream state in a weird way though you know were intending you know somebody called ah dreams are be real you know we've got weird weird stuff going on there and dreams thought\nThey are often times ... cognitive you know they're forecasting all the time I mean I was fascinated to see when I was studying\nYou know time the fact that time is so elastic and not this one way arrow\nI was really interested to find that that um a lot of people a lot of people pre dreamed that nine eleven\nUm as far as the tax um Rupert\nShell Drake did a study of it and found so many people had dreams of it of\nPlanes going into buildings that has a high rise buildings\nAnd maybe not even in New York but they had that kind of very very specific dream and also they know that the Titanic had a record number of people um cancel their tickets for that maiden voyage the one that sank and\nThe the somehow they knew ahead of time so we're picking up all\nAll kinds of information ahead of time it's not beyond that you know the realm of possibility that we're also sending out what we want to have happen we're thinking about it\nThe key though is I think being really specific as I mentioned before and also the power of a group you know we had before our break we had that caller call in about how to fix all of his his illnesses you know his pain\nAnd I really got to say that the one way is to get a power of a group together\nBecause let them in ten for you to be very specific about where your pain is that you want to kill\nThe pain and you're you know if you've got a pain in your left so I'm

are flowing into those groups and their own only mandate is to destroy people with whom they disagree\nThis cabin or thing was not accidental and it wasn't caused by one woman stepping fourth this was

asking young people are going to vote and are going to say there say no because they're not really into this you have been in the middle is why I was out doing law enforcement you weren't integrated into all this politics have you yourself\nEver seen ... or the Democrat Party ever leave any sense of normalcy of what this country is all about I mean I remember when Reagan was in office the Democratic\nWay they would say is that when Newt Gingrich came to power every member was right after the the Clinton care fiasco they tried to do socialized medicine didn't work out the Republicans when they took power Clinton was smart enough and I think through the advice of people like Dick Morris and others\nTo move to more to the center right\nAnd we were able to get to a balanced budget it was one the Republicans put together they finally got Bill Clinton assigned it and it worked but it was more at a political necessity than any\nBut you but you had those important moments face to face with people your your your height your for your best friend and and you get kinda figured out how to work it out now kids are like all this from behind a screen and we also talked\nWe offer them a little bit torn with you because I Will say well my son was young and I guess it was a battle of the time but I got um a\nPlayStation ... for and we were playing Scooby Doo night of a hundred and ... and do this four year old kid learn how to figure out how to get to the twelfth level and and kill the mastermind long before I could ever figure it out and I tell a\nFunny I tell a funny story in the book about that because my dad is the least tech savvy person in the world right hateful that stuff and he got defeated the super Mario Brothers and\nI can do about that but you know but think about all these kids they know get on line of international competitions\nOn X. box and I mean I I watch my son played two X. box is at the same exact time\nYeah it's scary but you know those games are wired to get people addicted\nYou must but then when I was not out drinking he's not getting in trouble\nThat's true but if they're going to do that if they're going to stockpile I think ... and the river ever do any of that stuff all I'm saying is that when you're raising your kids or even by yourself\nYou have to remember that certain things can't be done online you still have to learn that eye contact\nSports these kids that go on job interview you still have to be able to get their hobbies into personal relationships and excel if you're an adult and you're sitting with that phone next to your bed at night I wake up for ... it keeps you up in the middle of the night and that's a little light and then they didn't find the screen burns your sleep\nThat's a problem I heard from so many people that that that it was interfering with their\n... and you'll be proud of me I was an I did enjoy having Twitter fights with people a lot\nAnd I will it wasn't so much if it was well I probably a little too much I mean I was I mean there would be a ... a game on Hannity is at it with you know Alec Baldwin or whoever over Jimmy Kimmel wherever I happened to be fighting of the time\nAnd I realized that became another job but more importantly I Wonder what happened with our\nTwitter account was compromise what was what compromise and I just finally said this is ridiculous and I I just took it off my phone I don't I I Linda does the tweeting and somebody at Fox does the tweeting I just you know I said please tweet the south pleased with that I don't have to do\nBut there's also more component here too because we often talking politics about instant gratification I'm without he is the gratification society you people don't there's no process to anything anymore nobody destiny if you look at dating a relationship to anyone who has teenagers should be terrified because these you know these apps\nAnd kids are in social media what kids are doing all these sites it's all very overwhelming and your\nKids to Denver that relationships are requiring that all the\nValues that we value unless you're talking about conservative values all the time now for and it is that's great but a lot of that going by the wayside with the with the ... so that's not to say you can't play video games and you can't have fun and I watch a a bitch watch something on athletic but you also have to remember to have these conversations with your kids to have these conversations with yourself you sell the\nSocial media behavior Congress and some pop stars it's\nNot it's not it has gotten vicious is no doubt I mean like a certain amount of fighting I'm not going to sit here and why I kinda like\nAnd it's entertaining to watch people bubble in ... when you take a shot at these old leaders in uh Hollywood or left wing or but\nBoy with a book is great do not disturb how it goes to my cell phone to take back my life to the diabetes ... and of course you see all turn on the Fox news channel now that she has been rescued from the view and uh we\nWe appreciate you being back with us and it's good to hear your voice thanks for being here\nThank you so much on greatly appreciate

of it here and then we'll try to get some calls and listen to this\nYou know people expect that if you're black you have to be Democrats I have a a I have\nConversations that basically said that

we'll give you more money for having more kids in your home and then we got rid of the mental health Institute in the eighties and nineties and the prisoner re\nJust shot up and now you have ... Iraq where people called ... which is actually our murder rate is going down by twenty percent every year I just talked to the superintendent met with Microsoft Access Ron ROMs a right hand man so uh I think it's the brave early that helps you to the game called life\nYou know they tried to scare me to not ready to have my own friends but his hat\nIt gives me it gives me power in a way\nYou know

where you know it's something about [noise] you know I Love Hillary I Love everyone right but the campaign I'm with her just didn't make me feel as a guy\nThat didn't get to see my dad all the time like a\nThat could play catch with this time it was something about when I put his hat off and made me feel like Superman you made a Superman that was that's my favorite superhero\nCatch with its time

to you look up to ... to American industry guys nonpolitical no bullshit and just go there\nAnd get it done right now you gave me the heart to go to a fetus because at the heat is when I went in and two thousand Fifteen we're fourteen billion dollar company losing two billion dollars a year now we have a thirty eight billion dollar mark and ... it's called the ... the effect\nAnd I went to cast for we had a meeting in Chicago and I said\nYou have to bring manufacturing on\nShore instead even shore inches of course is that about the for is the core of a sea to Chicago is the core middle America we have to make that America strong\nI mean this this thing made me a billionaire and I could have lost two hundred million dollars\nWalking away from that deal but even with that I knew it was more important to me to take the chance of walking away from that deal than I have no fathers in Chicago with no home and when we do have written a reformation for no cause it's a it's a humbling patient not\nRehabilitated because they didn't have the ability and the first place\nWe never had anyone that taught us we didn't teach us and we had no one the powder\nRight so I'm a it's more important than any specific deal any anything that we bring jobs into America One of the movies\nThat I loved that liberal tried to do with how to control a black\nPerson to the concept of racism because they know that we're very proud of emotional people do and I said I like try to like someone as liberal they'll say oh what is right to you think race can control\nThem visible\nI Would like

the portions of the video the audio or in the last segment before you ... call Dan I'm your reaction I mean I'm seeing it all over social media\nAnd some people are like well she's calling Arizona crazy she's calling the the representatives crazy ... what is your take on this video\nWell this is just qualifying or could be a senator in Arizona there is not the first of many are out of the mainstream and extreme things that cares and put them I had done and and that in her past\nAh it's you know two thousand and a lot and and the killing people at a state that Arizona is crazy and has the killer gets paid for Republicans all always try to act like she's right of center and went over Republicans in order to win it's a it's one thing after another you know whether it\nProtesting our trip and I think I think you are passing out flyers that approach has good kicking us as at our troops including a you know as skeletons and thing where the terrorists\nOr you know calling herself about product socialist lying about her upbringing and now they're\nYou know calling Arizona crazy plus he's running to try and represent Arizona are now correct in front of a true colors are finally coming out with unbelievable that is a man with a bunch of Arizona and media today after an event like governor did they and they didn't even care to talk about this issue and then when I brought it up\nReally made excuses for her again it's it's unbelievable how they are continuing to protect her and cover up her record but we've got to make sure that voters\nThe herder we'll send them as the who the ... and make their choice to be creative protest there are a patriot\nAnd Congress from Sally that doesn't surprise me I mean I I I pick up on things all the time and I'm like where's everybody else and and you know others do that as well\nAnd Congress and let me tell you that doesn't surprise me I mean I I I pick up on things all the time and I'm like where's everybody else and and you know others do those well where is the outrage them let me tell you about something here and I want to get your take on this I didn't have this in my notes but\nWe have an issue here in the city of Flagstaff and we broadcast all over northern Arizona we broadcast out of ...\nWhere a sitting vice mayor of the city\nHas as her I'm a picture on what's it called the the handle the pictures of profile picture on our side down flag and it went up rate one Brett Kavanaugh was um was was voted in into by the Senate um you served\nObviously now and I think it's very dark when I saw a picture on line of you and your uniform next to Nate ten and a and cinnamon to to to um it's very shark and then you see a lot of these folks on the far left hanging a flag upside down what does that mean to you as someone who served their country when\nYou see that\nIt it's disgusting or if it's disrespectful\nA and look I put my life on the line and wore the uniform or for their right to be protesting ah but this isn't about whether you know you had the freedom to do that this is about whether you should be the next senator from Arizona I'm sure I ... and the case of sending a letter that is something that we want and are twelve senator\nEver in Arizona somebody who was denigrating our troops are advocating against military action against terrorists right after nine eleven you know and and I wanted to shut down the air force base\nA she is an extreme radical left wing Green Party activist\nAnd that is not what Arizona is all about and in this whole protester issue we've seen it over the last year we trade the Democrats can't win at the ballot box what we've seen as they just want to use intimidation or they want to use mob rule uh they want to use you know protests to be able to get the uh and so that's why this Senate election is so important\nThe balance of the U.S Senate the decision as to whether Chuck Schumer Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders or all their friends are in charge\nA comes down to whether I weighed in Arizona or not\nThat's why we need people to wake up uh we need Republicans and get energized especially those who don't vote in mid term elections usually we need right leaning independents independents who care about our military care about lower taxes less regulation is a secure border\nWe need them to get engaged and we need them to vote for Martha McSally that'd be honored to have their vote and represent us in Arizona\nBut this is a consequential race for the country as well\nCongresswoman Shelly I mean you mentioned the um ... I mean they were literally literally clawing at the door protesting it was disgusting to watch is like a zombie movie\nAnd let me ask you your position on Capitol had you been in the Senate at the time um where where were you at give me your thoughts on the Kavanaugh appointment\nI absolutely would have voted yes for justice Kavanaugh my opponent cast in cinema said she would have voted no she said she'd be like a Joe Manchin moderate Democrat if she gets elected well Joe mansion voted yes\nAnd send a message he would vote now uh so I look over the last several weeks I think what has happened is a travesty as someone who is a survivor of sexual abuse and assault myself\nI was disgusted with how this whole thing was handled my heart goes out to Dr Ford a and clearly she has been through traumatic events in her life\nBut she didn't want to have her name and the limelight and what the Democrats did to her\nA hanging onto her a letter and then leaking it and then you basically using her a for their agenda in order to get out of the politics of personal destruction to destroy this man was just disgusting and I think people thought it was on you know is on you for everyone to see\nIn in the end we are a country that has due process we're a country that has the presumption of innocence\nUh and I think it's an important conversation that we have than having many women and some men events are awful experiences in their lives but that doesn't mean that they have to get their reckoning on the backs of vet Kavanaugh so I can be for having a conversation and my heart going out for\nSurvivors as one myself uh and and and finding a way for us to prevent this in the future and find healing for people but I can also be for the things that our country was founded on and vote yes on Brett Kavanaugh and that's what I Would have done\nCongressman Murtha much salaries my guess she's also running for the U.S Senate is obviously a ... I'm Martha you served in combat agent pilot I that's one of my favorite interviews I've done with you when you talked about that in detail but you've seen these conflicts\nUp close so we talked about ... she's there protesting um I Would assume and similar timeframe that you were serving over there is that accurate\nIn fact yes I was in Saudi Arabia on nine eleven a loving of the Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia we went immediately into a lock down and then we very quickly ramped up to plan\nAnd execute the campaign in Afghanistan and at that time literally the day after nine eleven\nThen I'm at its protesting using military force against her if she wanted to bring them into the courts instead and then later on she's leading protests and the thing to do and handing out flyers saying we us troops are the terrorists\nYou know she's protesting a President Bush for setting up the department of homeland security she's protesting against support for Israel's\nProtesting Lieberman for working with Republicans\nSee that on the radio saying come and our case comes socialist come communist all come to our protests\nAnd said it was okay she was okay with Americans joining the Arab on this is extreme stuff\nIt just broke in the media yesterday that she was inviting a lawyer who went to jail for basically you know supporting the blind shaker was responsible for the world Trade Center bombing and she was inviting her you know to the ASU campus\nAfter she had been indicted and and making excuses for her you can't make this stuff off that she's actually in a dead heat with me to be Arizona twelve senator [laughter] unbelievable and disqualifying on so many levels\nWe live in an unbelievable time so nothing nothing surprises me anymore well let me ask you is over there you've seen it underground she was protests yeah um because there's lots of folks and Trump's been President Trump's been one of them said hey there's certain roles that we should do and should do in the world\nUm but what's your take on it I mean where should we be what should we be doing you know with our military might in the world what's what's appropriate what's what's your what's your role\nLook I'm grateful that President Trump is willing to put America First has asked what we need to be doing we only we can do to leaders of the free world but he is\nI'm Wendy Rogers the Republican running against Tom O'Halleran\nI strongly support President Trump to make America great again he shares my conservative views on the issues Andy makes it worse booming economy more jobs used on trade deals to protect American workers new small businesses and he takes the illegal alien invasion serious way\nThere's a clear choice this November continues strong growth under President Trump or go back to failed policies and open borders to resist Democrats want\nI'm Wendy Rogers I approved this message because we need Congress to stand with President Trump and against a left wing resistance who's trying to stop him paid for by Wendy Rogers for Congress Wendy Rogers dot org\n\n... role\nIn the dead\nJoke Sunni grown worthy but also one of the simplest ways to share a\nMoment with your kid when you said when he got to go on my sons\nTo take a moment and make your kid language because dad jokes ...\nMake your kid laugh today motherhood that go to ... by the U.S government of health and Human Services and the ad council\nAs I went through school one giant question loomed over what did I Want to be\nFirst I had to decide what I wanted to make I Want it to make more on it became a teacher now I make learning privilege not a chore and frustration tool not an obstacle I make working hard seems easy and giving 'em ...

going to be up here in the second uh and then after the governor we're going to have a local candidate for flex a city council Paul cheesy and we're going to\nLike I told you were in and goes through the propositions for the city a couple of 'em are big wants to housing issue and a wage issue and uh you know we've spent an enormous amount of time talking about\nThose issues are for the past several months so you're probably going home and getting your ballot ballots are arriving about Seventy percent of you get your vote by mail and uh that's changed tremendously over the past several years now I'm not a big fan of the early ballot\nBecause I think it's made her election but obviously I'm In the minority because Seventy percent of you're doing this so what do I know but Seventy percent of you're doing this but the elections a month\nLong so the ... election process is among the wrong and that makes for heart campaigning that makes for you have a new door these political adds a lot longer so I don't know but people are doing\nAnd if we need to make changes or or if there are policies that need adjustments that's one thing but we we should be supportive of of these brave Americans\nGovernor ... been in there for years what are you most proud of\nWell I I'm I'm most proud of the way we've been able to balance the budget I came in there's one billion dollar deficit now we're seeing a top a four hundred and thirty two million dollars in our general fund\nAnd we haven't raised taxes and we've been able to get a twenty percent pay increase to our teachers by school year twenty twenty I didn't catch his good affective responsible leadership and management it's proper budgeting just like everyone who's listening has to live within their means\nThe state made some tough decisions now our our budgets balanced\nOur economy's booming and were able to put money into K. twelve education and and the props to our teachers who are getting the job done Arizona kids are proving faster in math and reading than any other kids in the country so that raised was burned and deserved\nA governor do see you get back in their lives assume you when you get back and you got four more years what's the big thing what's your big push assuming the economy's going good going forward what do you want to get done\nWell look a number of things first you can never assume the economy's gonna keep going good because people vote with their feet the American economy is booming yeah you see an exodus\nFrom places like California and Connecticut and Illinois and that's because people vote with their feet and in many of those states they've got terrible public policy they're raising taxes they're increasing regulations so the first thing I Want to do is secure\nArizona's future economically and then I think we have some real opportunity to make our schools safer I don't want to be reactive to a tragedy inside our schools I Want to be proactive\nI also want to get more of these dollars that we're putting into K. twelve education\nInto the classrooms and lastly I think we have an opportunity and a growing economy in the states it seems like everybody in the country wants to live and to make sure that we have a proper tax code a tax code that really rewards work and investment and makes our state in his practice place to live going forward\nI I I almost have to follow up on that but I'm sure you'd have to do to let you there's a lot of work on the tax code but my ears perked up on that Governor doozy or any ideas anything or is it just you want to fix the tax what do you want to do Arizona well I've\nTalked a lot about lowering our income tax you know a Nevada has zero income tax Texas has zero income tax my opponent would like to double income tax and the state of Arizona I think that's the wrong direction about the worst idea of possible\nBut when we do at a booming economy like we do I think to look at our income tax to look at our sales

twenty anti Geoff\nOnly on Ninety seven one a big talker\n\nThe show and I have a boy [noise]\nBack eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one here with Flagstaff city council candidate Paul is easy going through some of these\nPropositions there's so much this ballot or do you do early ballots are you ... did you get it yet uh no I'm not sure how long this thing is because you got statewide and and there's so much like a scroll yeah there's a huge and now there's a lot local a there's a lot countywide school district stuff they're statewide stuff\nOr one of them is proposition um for twenty it is the it's a bridge mhm and you know it's okay it's a bridge but people don't know if people probably do realize likes that kind of split in half\nWith the train tracks do we need another bridge right now we've got four straight overpass they want to build this bird right in the downtown area it's a chunk of change I I Want to say a hundred million or so it's a hundred and thirty one million after a yeah interest drawbridge I mean [laughter]\nYou know what does this thing yeah it's going to be a lot of money a over lone tree and to be honest we have so many taxes and bonds and so forth on the ballot now we're also going to have taxes and bombed them twenty twenty and twenty twenty two and I think that\nWell first of all I'm voting no on the bread OK no of course one of your guests because right now spending a hundred and thirty one million dollars on something\nEven if it may help a little bit with traffic which I argue it probably won't um we need to set priorities here is the city uh we have a hundred and eighty million unfunded pension liabilities for fire and police that I Want to see on the ballot and twenty twenty to take care of\nWe need to take care of our fire department and our police and really get down to basics with a lot of our government functions before we keep doing these\nAdults yeah and I don't think people realize the state of the pension issue not Prescott had a they had to vote and re did something just last year because they had a huge shortfall but it's not that it's going to get worse\nBefore it gets better it was a hundred and eight million now is a hundred and two million last year and Ninety eight million before that you know you can fit you know and it affects all of all of the city it's not just the fire department because our resources are getting diverted to take care of that and the fire department itself\nIs diverting their resources from a quip meant for gear\nFor new employees to pay for their pension plans that it's legally obligated to do\nSo the best way ...\nSources from a quip meant for gear for new employees to pay for their pension plans that it's legally obligated to do so the best way policies is\nMy guess folks that I can explain it it is the city just picture like a credit card you have a certain credit limit and there's only so many things you can do and what these bonding things and you're looking ahead\nEven though ... old bonds in debt get retired there still only so much capacity right and you're saying for twenty would take up you don't want to take up that capacity for that issue when you know there's things on their eyes\nYeah they're going to be more things on the horizon and you know getting taxed fatigue and everything else from the voters ... we need to set our priorities on council put the ... you know\nPut the horse behind that before the cart here and get the things that we need to take care of so I'm no on the uh proposition for twenty for a bridge or just to point out to\nYou know ... what's the big big bottleneck at dawn Humphries and route sixty six so we got the underpass right there in Milton we're going to put the lone tree bridge and well guess what that bottleneck is still going to exist as just that people are coming from east\nAnd west there rather than primarily from the west another pretty controversial um propositions proposition for twenty two my listeners know of this and we named it here on the show the Robin Hood tax 'em well beyond it's not\nFeel self tax I mean it's it's uh they pay it back to the property yeah yeah um this is this has to do with the city I'm using property taxes using money bonding up to twenty five million dollars to then use that money to try to address the Affordable housing issue right what do you think on this thing\nIt has NO PLAN they didn't put any safeguards in place is just hey give twenty five million dollar credit card the city council which is not twenty five million it's thirty seven million after you include the interest on it\nAnd they don't really have any plan to speak of ... what is going to be used for and you know it's a twenty year bond so even those listeners out there who trust the current council well guess what there's going to be nine more councils after that who are going to\nBe managing these dollar good point and I think that's something you always got to consider yeah who who ... you made like the people now you may not like the people who knows yeah you don't know who's coming in not only that\nThere's nothing in there that says the uh for double housing is going to be permanent\nMhm that's a huge issue so um it may be affordable and then people can selling off at a windfall later on there is also nothing in there that says that it has to be owner occupied\nSo what they're facing a asked men in particular and in Denver with their housing bonds if people would then rent out that property\nWith air B. and B. and make a bunch of money off of it so when you're not putting in these safeguards and thinking ahead council had two years to come up with this and it's just hey give us a twenty five well thirty seven million dollar carte blanche to do whatever we want oh we promise you will will spend a clay was slammed\nHer pretty quick it was not unanimous by any means I don't know if this is ... a big push 'em and it went through fast it's set up some kind of committee and then they'll decide what you know it was all kinds of it's very vague yes it could go really any direction I think that's got a lot of folks\nUm but that's another issue I've seen where there's been folks on the left and folks on the right who oppose it some young lawyer left who I I think normally wouldn't oppose it but then vice versa I've had folks in here on the right who say supports\nYeah ... it's really interesting uh I just saw a letter to the editor actually a few days ago a couple of days ago from Charlie silver who is a very good person who was involved in so many things around here uh for one he's involved with the town site um lamb trust the community land trust", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show",
