I've been here since I was ah about eight years old\nOkay and how would you know or ...\nRight now I'm thirty three\nOkay so your view of the United states or as a child in an adolescent to to today what what's changed in in what's your perspective\nYou know what I'm like in any any like any race there are good people there are bad people I've had good experiences and really bad ones too\nBut overall ... what people will have in this country\nIf it's like oh let me let me just say\nThe the privileges the ... everything that people have in this country a lot a lot a lot of the most ... if not everybody in the Democratic party except for graft or you know if it ... it just to me it's frustrating because\nWhat I what I remember when we're in first all troubled ran for president\nAll everybody all the celebrities saying oh we're going to leave this country hey I never knew they always say and they never do it still does not one of the law I Would love to take my recovery has five or ... or ... or what's his name ... if he if he saw him happy I looked at trends park\nWell Colin Kaepernick is wait making way too much money being a the the role the victim who who sacrificed everything making what about asked me to a hundred million dollars\nOh just a little bit more they would have made as a backup quarterback in the NFL so yeah I mean he he fully has a capitalized on his victims status and a Isaac I appreciate the call into perspective you know it's interesting\nI'm Aaron ... filling in for more calls in by the way and in in South Florida\nHispanic means about thirty different things\nAnd people always over simplify it in part of the reason why the way you have a lot of folks that gets Florida elections one because you'll have some of these ah pollsters are Randall is out there who will say you know hey nationally Hispanics break X percent for Democrats and bases that hey we have a very large\nHispanic contingent in Florida\nAnd then you go all those people are going to break for Democrats at this present well hold on\nHold on for just a minute [laughter] you have to figure out all the different interest in all the various different groups that are here all the Caribbean islands that are represented\nMexico yes you do have south and Central America it's also represented one the things that I found to be most interesting kind of like a Isaac was indicating there you're on DACA\nFor many on the right there are stereotypes and assumptions for example if someone's ear on DACA ... they probably are and Obama type a Democrat is they don't like Donald Trump right\nWell no not necessarily a big misconception that white kind of like hey you know X number of Hispanics will break this way regardless of where they're from or what their interests are you've got to get to know the people and I've found\nFar more often than not\nThat people who really sought out the United states true immigrants bell\nWanted a better life overwhelmingly overwhelmingly are more conservative than not certainly socially more conservative than the Democrats have been in a very long time but even in terms of economics I mentioned earlier this hour\nYou have a lot of the younger folks you have millennials for example are starting to have their eyes open to why this economy can do what the United States economy is capable of\nThey didn't know before because they became adults during the recession and then the Obama economy so now they're just starting to go wow you know things can be different I've seen it\nEven around radio you were with some folks that have been here over the years like wow you know really can't get better yeah get you can same deal with a lot of Hispanics\nA lot of different backgrounds might have folks that want a better life if they can obtain that they're going to want more of that and so what we've actually been seen increasingly ... is a trend towards them\nTwo of the most watched districts in the country did a a BBC special on the mid term elections they wanted to highlight six different regions of the country and the tops of elections\nAs the case may be in South Florida here we have the two most heavily democratic districts currently represented by Republicans in the United States House their districts twenty six and twenty seven in Florida and district twenty six\nYou had Hillary Clinton win in that district in twenty sixteen my sixteen points\nBut you had Carlos Curbelo the curtain representative who's a Republican win by five or six points\nYou know how does that happen\nThat wouldn't happen in other parts of the country right\nI mean the the there are too many people will just both the ticket if you're a belief or Hillary Clinton how could you vote for any Republican\nCongressionally\nAgain when I was just mentioning not as a conventional as the not so ... a conventional wisdom\nAnd district twenty seven you have Hillary Clinton having won that district by twenty points when he points\nAnd you had the retiring early interrupt lightened when that district by ten\n... that's the difference here and that's why it's important\nTo break the odds with these stereotypes to really understand some of the dynamics many folks do not support the left and what they've been doing from the immigration thing uh in in many folks that are on your on DACA got a disproportionate number one in South Florida talked a lot of them over the years\nThey might surprise you politically so anyway you just a little food for thought as we're three weeks away from election day let's go to Ryan who wants to take me to task Ryan in San Francisco go\nOh a a a you you mentioned that you know ... people who smoke\nPot or all dumb or whatever or not or are not educated are not\nGoing to be kind of\nCame across that I made a stereotype about it yes but you're you're here to tell me that's not the case you and your ball on our our ... are on the right to\nI I

they're about five steps too complicated to do here on the air okay but basically you can put in the amount of pain but you would receive and put in an average death age of\nUh Seventy six for a male Seventy eight for a female\nUh-huh that's how they're calculated typically or actuarial tables\nAnd uh then you figure out what the president value of those payments are because that's what you're going to receive and\nThat's what they're saying that they're offering you and it's probably the discount rate is the interest rate and it's probably six percent five and a half percent something like

rings twelve you have thirty minutes to get it done okay\nIf you have to shut down the checking account if you have to shut down the credit cards and if you have to freeze your credit that's fine but

very sad sad to be Seventy years old and that and so and then the next thing you need to do is you need to pull\nOr and or you can do that for free once a year with each of the three credit bureaus and see if there's anything showing up on your credit bureau report regarding identity theft roommate she if she has opened cards and your name as well\nOK\nAnd let me help you to your sister may or may not have been really mad\nAnd she may or may not meant for your grandmother to be picked up but here's the thing the only way if someone opens on account and your name\nThe only way to get that account cleared other than pay it yourself which would be pretty stupid to pay an account that you didn't open when someone stole your identity the only way to keep from doing that is you have to file a police report\nAnd when you're filling out the police report they always ask you if you know who stole your identity and if you don't tell them that would be breaking the law and so your sister followed the law properly when the police report as being filled out and said yes I Know who the identity thief is\nMy grandmother and I'm I'm surprised that actually that they went and picked her up but they did and um you know show 'em 'cause it is it is a federal law it is a federal offense now to steal and identity and so um she she's in trouble [noise]\nShe's in real trouble but your sister ... could maybe accidentally activated all of this because she just had to do a police report to get the identity theft removed from her name right ... but she may have been just mad and gotten her rest and I don't know either way's fine with me but um\nThose moments definitely a thief but oh my goodness what a sad thing though what horrible thing you guys are going through not Cody um well much

Phoenix, Arizona hey Michael\nI'm doing good I just want to say a God Bless a thank you for this show\nThank you sir how can we help today\n[laughter] yeah so I have a quick question for you so um my wife and I we we celebrated in house or we saw the one I'm with the money we paid off a lot of our debt credit card car I'm In a few other debts and the only that we have left is student loan debt mhm\nUm and so we ... we between my wife and I we oh about a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars in student loan debt [laughter] um so we're just trying to figure out what we can do between the upgrade of the new house\nAnd the ah the student loans that we have left how will we get paid off for me to try to just figure out how to do that\n[noise]\n[noise] uh spend less than you make and put it on the student loan I mean what are you thinking about I don't understand\nWho they were just we're just trying to figure out like ... there's three of them between us I'm a teacher [laughter] um I Know the built our loan forgiveness programs but I'm just trying to figure out\nLoans programs don't work there ten years long you don't want to be in debt in years what's your household income\nSo take home between my wife and I we um we make to do something about fifty seven thousand a year\nOkay and how much is your house payment\n[noise] so we haven't got an offer so we just moved um so the house payment will be around sixteen hundred a month\nOkay you're right at a fourth ... right and you have no other that except the student loans\nCorrect okay and so if you put twenty thousand dollars a year on these is going to take you five years so I think I think you've got to look at ways to increase your income\nOkay you got a lot of student loans for two teachers what are yours you're going to lead you where'd you get your degrees\nOr so she has her masters I got my bachelor's see we we both went to in a new northern Arizona university\nWow you must have put everything on there um [noise]\nYeah you lift your debts small is the largest the three loans pay minimum payments on the two big ones attacked the smallest one with a vengeance that way you can see that trees all

now I have a job and I'm making\nMaking about forty thousand a year and um [noise] well I got another job offer for thirty three\nAnd\nA new one reason I'm considering it was because the the benefits are a lot better mhm I'm there for four one K. more paid holidays more vacation um they also pay one hundred percent of my health insurance from\nThe soil is your health insurance costs now I don't\nHave any I Can't afford any mhm okay so the company that I'm a company I'm with now it's it's like five hundred dollars a month or something just for me mhm mhm\nSo a thousand dollars five hundred dollars a month or six thousand dollars a\nYear you're talking about taking a pay cut of nine thousand dollars mhm you're going to trade six for non if you're doing it for health insurance four one K. benefit is worth very little and the other benefits are and you know more time off is not what you need you need more money\nWell that and the potential to grow at that company would be a lot more\nQuickly hum hum next year or two what'd you double your income I don't quite know but now a quick which are W\nCouldn't I couldn't be looking at and the next two years I can be looking at like maybe [noise] maybe another ten thousand a year back up to where you were\nUm yeah plus the health insurance yeah yeah well\nThe the the benefits are worth very very little in this equation um I Would not do it for the benefits\nOkay I might do it if it's taking one step back and I get into a career I Love shark and take six steps forward because we had I Want to or how old are you\nA twenty three so the question is when you're forty three Twenty years from today mhm does this take you where you want to go Twenty years from today\nIf it's not telling you in that direction then you're doing this for health insurance benefits and that is a dumb idea\nOkay [noise] um I mean maybe maybe not this job in mind I don't I don't know exactly how are you not that much about the company quite yet but it it does open the door for for the [noise] it it it it could turn it could help transition\nMe and to the courier I Want to be what do you want to be is I Want to be a master diesel

quickest way to do that\nLeast will tell you that I Know a good makes a long long way to go there\nA lot more than forty two right oh yeah yeah how can we look kind of like a hundred grand a year\nThat's what I was thinking okay so what's the shortest path there again we've got to get to search how you get the search\nUm commute or a technical school I guess at a at the only way I Know\nWhat's it like once you get into a company that would put me through the school day you got what feels like you're talking about working\n... what's the other place you're talking about working what do they do\nUm they actually work on a big er I'm a ... trailers and stuff like that what kind of work they do diesel [laughter] yeah they have than they have a mayor and stuff I Would just I

... sort of hard work and you go from thirty three to a hundred then nobody gives a crap about health insurance we just tripled your income dude and you're doing what you want to do yeah now that's a plan\nSo they have to order three hours in the interview if you like it you say gently and kindly with a smile if you want me health insurance is not the carrot to dangle quickly getting made the

by doing a budget together if forces you to combine your goals\nAnd in a new marriage that's essential um when I first got married thirty five years ago they used to tell us the hardest year of marriage was the first year\nCaitlin is on the line in Denver Hi Caitlin how are you\nPay ... thank you for taking my call Hank Kelly for taking\nSure I'm going to help quit\nLike [laughter] like that my husband started his own painting ... that just a few months ago and he has done a pretty big contract but in the April ... billion into work at it and like anything I took a lot ... than\nThey can buy [noise] and so we're trying to hire anybody but we're not\nHaving a hard time finding a good ... plays an industry because it usually is rather than they were hired for how can little gadgets hoping I complained certainly the one way that we can actively try\nReliable and get people to be a part of this law seemed like they say oh\nYou don't know any painters that are good and a lot of\nPeople well we didn't know painter um that are good people look at it the part is that there hasn't been reliable you don't know any painters that are good and reliable people oh well we do know that they have their own businesses as well\nMhm so the only painters that you know that are good and reliable people already have their own business\nFor the most part yeah [noise] okay we're we're trying like we we put 'em up on Craig's list and like nobody's responding to it and so\nI just we just don't know where to look in order to get\nWell most of the time they would rely people run around with good reliable people yeah and\nThen most of the time to pushes run around with due to ... so usually when I'm looking good reliable people I look around other good reliable people not could be that you look in some of the other trades and you know one electrician that's a good person or a trim carpenter that's a good person and you got started asking them who do they know that's a great\nPainter that you could bring on to the job\nA part of the problem ... very very hot construction market in Denver and so every body's got work even do fusses\nYeah\nYour has your husband's got more working hand or maintenance so that that you've got a bit of a labor shortage ah when you've got a construction but I'm always in the city and that's what you're facing a little bit of but the way I have found like you know and it is an apple in our world it wouldn't be a painter but in our world it might be someone that's in technology\nSomeone that has a a great Rubio and rails developer as an example there's a shortage of technology and Web developer is out there right now\nIn most cities including Nashville in Nashville is actually a tech hub\nBut um you know there's a shortage so where do we find those well we you know we go on like you've done website you go on Craig's list but we get in technology groups and associations and but mainly\nGreat developers no other great developers great painter isn't or the great painters or somebody is not a developer but has other influence in and other knowledge of the tech industry that's a great person will no somebody's great developer and send them our way and of course you're going to pay them\nAnd pay them well\nAnd I'm a but paying a do push doesn't make them anything except that will pay ... so you you want to pay people well but you that that's not the part of the only part of the equation as you've already discovered so the only way I don't know how to find them would be to find other people in other trades that are excellent and people in the\nPainting world that are excellent and try to move them onto your team once you get a couple of excellent people they will have a tendency to help you find the other excellent people uh sixty four percent of people to joined our team last year were internal referrals someone already working here\nThat was a thoroughbred wanted new in thoroughbred that wouldn't want them to work here in another area now we have the advantage of being a little bit larger and having a vast array of jobs not just a single job available but but that's how I've always done it I've I've found thoroughbreds Roma thoroughbreds and donkeys run with donkeys\nAnd so you know you just got to find out find your thoroughbreds and and people out in the community the thoroughbred some I Do there's a steak dinner in it for you guys send you a good guy you send him a steak dinner you send them\nBruce Chris or something because it's worth it to get somebody on there and you know be be good that way and I'll tell you I'm going to send you a copy of a book that is one of my favorite hiring books that have written the last two years and it it it's from a friend pat Lynch you only it's called the ideal team player and the ideal team player is three things hungry\nHumble and smart hungry humble and smart\nAnd that's what you're looking for in any position in any organization in every trade and every organization has some people to qualify other high quality people every single one\nAnd if you can put them together in a trade that by and large is not that kind of people than you really a brand differentiated yourself from the other people in your market Bush\nSo hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we will send that to you [noise] open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five that's AAA eight to five five two to five or ... is with us in Wilmington, Delaware Hi Alisha how are you\nHi there thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nI'm new at center and I ... and they have to put my question actually about the four oh one K. profit sharing with my former employer I Lived it over like you said ... role ever IRA\nAnd then I got a statement and allow yesterday basically there was a other section where the fees or over three thousand dollars and by further looking into it they're out for ... for for um for eight different fires and kind of confused of every three thousand dollars\nOf my money how much money was in there it wasn't that much actually with only around Eighteen thousand dollars\nI don't I'm not aware of a mutual fund that has a forfeiture fee\nThan looking at a at the last eight different names and then it says forfeit shirt and that has a bunch of negative and it adds up to almost thirty one hundred dollars\nThat sucks yeah I thought I thought especially when it was only you know a small ... to begin with\nYou know really um did you roll it was a smart Mr pro\nI wrote it ever enter ... previously on another IRA that I had already banned\nSo you don't have an advisor I don't think that\nUm\nI Am sorry I Do not know the answer your question I've never run into that the only thing I can guess is is that you bought a ... that your company your former company the mutual funds or coffee mutual funds or some gun\nThat have got some kind of gotcha and they're obviously okay but I don't know what they are go ahead and get in touch with one of the more of us are pros and your area and just see if they won't answer that question for you okay maybe they can tell you exactly what happened at least you'll have the mystery solved since Dave Ramsey too stupid to answer the question is I just don't know the answer\nThat I just don't ... I'm Sorry I Wish I did read Joel is with us in a Decatur, Alabama Hi Rachel how are you\nI'm great how are you for taking my\nCall sure what's up [noise]\nSo my employer is going through open enrollment or our health insurance benefits and I'm kind of on the fan I'm hoping that maybe you could kind of helped me John I'm\nDave energy to any high deductible a program with an H essay which they will be contributing to and I'm trying to decide that I keep my tradition all the the ... clan or should I jump on board but it's high deductible plans\nAnd how much is a premium on the ...\nThe premium all the eighty two per pay period and they calculate to about Twenty one hundred a year\nAnd what about the other one\nThe other one will be around thirty four hundred a year\nOkay thirty for hundreds of Twenty one hundred and Thirteen hundred dollar spread yeah and how much is the doctor will only\nPay so on the ... it'll be four hundred are individual or the PBS mhm [noise] and for the high deductible Thirteen fifty per individual but there is a twenty seven hundred for the family\nYou know and how how uh how how old are your kids\nMy kids are ten and Thirteen are there any I'm only going illnesses or something by Ron [noise] although they are also adoptable\nHow often do well I'll say like right as of right now we just hit that adaptable and one of our family members emerging that hit in the years I'd say it's\nOkay so here's the thing you just compare your Thirteen hundred savings versus the risk taking more fairly healthy we don't usually run through the ... so the hot adoptable lower premium makes a lot of sense for us and that's how you look at it\n\n\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family\nHas debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are in your baby steps it's a necessity not a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well as stay at home parents it's\nOver this ten years so now that you are the coordinator that it's paid off their house people looked at you like wow\nMy hero yeah how do you do that what do you tell them what's the key to getting out of debt\nI think it's the budget you gotta start there um and I think now on this side of it you just have to believe that it's going to work and just keep plugging away at it um and small steps add up to a giant staff at the end you know\nAnd I I Would add to that ah the giving them the ... um well it's really hard I mean where when we started I\nUsed to routinely think like while we're driving in church like boys what we're given what we are tied into the church today you know we could do this or do that and I'm just slowly over time that's changed and I don't have this um you know deficit mentality any more aware and taking away it's we've learned how to Liz\nHave joy within our means and once you hit that point it's um\nIt just makes the road a lot easier to drive\nYou know so you had a two hundred and fifty thousand our mortgage approximately when you started this and um it didn't seem real that would ever get paid off somewhere along the line you looked up and said\nAh this is going to work and they started like you were writing downhill instead of climbing up here you know what I'm Talking to the point you remember where that was in the mortgage balances like when you got down to fifty or you got down to a hundred or when was that you went had gone we're really doing this\nBut I think it was last year I I went back to work for one year uh-huh and get all of my income went towards the mortgage because it was about ... ... thousand lap and we just\nJust piled on every month and it was like you just can't counting it down month by month we're going to make it and it was it was off\nIt'd be you wouldn't have even going back to work if you didn't already have those numbers calculate knew it was just for a year now they're talking to this year we're done ... so I'm In for a year and you can embrace of Europe pain so by then you knew it was really going to happen it was real it was before that that you believe\nThat yeah I I mean we were under water on her mortgage for about three four years oh ... for me it was like when we uh oh it as much as what the equity was um then it's like started feeling you know we can breathe and and now at least we can sell it and get out of it around right on

I wrote a book about the the twilight zone then in subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating an addictive phone while he was floating in this pool\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word um I don't know if you did most of them in the pool in the\nPool but he's certainly dictated most of his strips and and honestly I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nLet's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation so he was um [noise]\nYou know he was had the patriotic fervor of you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he\nHe wanted to do his part I'm so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could and he had this um this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper unit that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was\nAssigned to the five hundred eleventh parachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne and he saw some pretty heavy combat in in the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and it's ... it's called them for life and and it affected pretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality to them in did he get that from his combat oh he's from his office yeah he\nUm he went back to the battlefield um several times a before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the twilight zone so [noise]\nUm it was always there was always part of his makeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of twilight zone episodes particularly one called the purple testament which is actually set in lady\nUm during World War two so that was as close as he got to literally revisiting his his combat experience in twilight zone and then several other other shows like I said before and after this while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in the golden age of television was any\nYes he uh he certainly was it was a time when television was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up\nAnd television needed writers or was it was it was this fast you know if they've asked we find it was a vast medium that was just devoid of talent at the time and ... you know a jumped right into it and he said he was so prolific any wrote so much\nThat he just sent stuff outside stuff out and so finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know it shows were you know we're all over the place did\nYou have a chance to talk to Scott Carol ... wife\nI did not unfortunately no no the way they hit a tree with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah yeah\nNow with with rod he started before he got into twilight zone user writer for other kinds of shows was any\nOh sure sure there are some people may not know this but rod Serling was\nWithout question the most prestigious writer in television before the toilet so\nHe had written you know he won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five fifty six and fifty seven a twilight zone started and fifty nine I'm so he was at the top of the of the heap or before the twilight zone came out and she just kind of took that dramatic you know just straight for drama\nSensibility into the twilight zone and gave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times when he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to the twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to a critique him editorialize and even controlling\nYeah yeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that Serling ran into is that he believe that it's a writer's job to do those things that the writer job to address the issues of his time and every time he tried to address any\nIssue of any social import on television the censors would get in this way the sponsors would get in this way and it was frustrating for him and\nThankfully for ... for rod he was successful enough and he had built such a name for himself that they were willing to give him his own show and he had always loved science fiction he loves fantasy science fiction or you know all that kind of thing so he\nCreated the twilight zone because he always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it and say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff\nBy if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it will be a little less a controversial\nEvery twilight zone episode Nick that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show with\nA cool ending it had a message didn't it\nOh absolutely if it was a TV series that just had a cruel twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now you know ... it's a it was always deeper than that certainly certainly episodes were always deeper than that\nUm because he again believe that that was part of the artist job the art if it's going to be art it has to what he would say that has to say something about something and you know it has to be entertaining he did wants to entertain but at the same time you have to say something about something\nWhat do you think some of the issues that he wanted to address in his work\nWell you know throughout his career the big the biggest issue was prejudice um rot had this this innate aversion to prejudice and he believed it was ... I Believe that all evils stem from prejudice that that's the beginning and if that's the root of all of them\nSo he wanted to address that idea that um we have this\nUm this tendency\nLook to other people to uh for our own fault when we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the twilight zone before and after\nHe illness some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about six years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine\nAnd yeah it is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released um science fiction magazine that but it it was ranking the top one hundred\nTelevision series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction as all television series and the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone it's the only the only one who made it and at this point\nYou know you ask the average twenty five year old they're not getting any black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone if it's entered the consciousness\nJust as a term you know people know that the twilight zone means what you think it means it means something is off kilter something strange something is you know not quite right and it's lasted all this time because of of routes messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written so well produced\nSo well acted a it was just a first class production from from get from point a to point the you know so so that's I think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and it's a Bradbury had heard about it and I had written an article about it in a what we had what's called the after dark newsletter\nIn a bread Bree just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about my ... my shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I got and that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office\nAbout what rod didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he knew right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no not listen nobody could write every script on you know Robert Ninety two hundred and fifty\nSix twilight zone episodes over five seed that's pretty prolific that is that's ridiculous I mean nobody writes\nNinety two shows in a five year five seats imperious just if you know and and at the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced is just\nIt's just off the charts I I'm just convinced he never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty the Nineteen Seventy five that was it [laughter]\nHe smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted he was just addicted to it maybe he got that in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah and absolutely had heart issues and that's what's finally did he meant you said that brought down the road to well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things she did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty other the total shows such crazy isn't it\nIt it really is you know when I was researching the book it it's you know this couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well first of all yeah Ninety two twilight zone episodes you also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories\nHa ha so those that's a hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides twice on the night gallery\nStay with us deck we're going to take a break we'll come back and talk more next hour we'll take phone calls with a buddy about the twilight zone and ... with us his book is called the rod Serling his life's work in an imagination\nAnd hackers in data miners are being more important to protect your personal information more you can with my I think that the only ...\nThe way you do ... safely and in complete control my combined secure communications with pride at ground zero virtual credit cards eight or by security deters thing you can actually shocked to sell their allies put out person I think you're paid I met her get out there now the now for credit card debt use your seat identity to stay safe secure and how\nOn my feet from the left or to go and get one free\nNinety seven point once the doctor coast to coast more stimulating taught Sunday mornings at eight more stimulating talk pastor Tim masters destined to win Ninety seven boy hey let's go back to the hotel ... George\nNowhere with you with Nick per E. C. with us a rod Serling his life working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there\nA hundred and fifty six hundred and ... and I know three of 'em for example it's a good life in praise of long distance call with that guy Billy ... who was a kid that scared everybody into the cornfield [laughter] yeah they sure yet whether you have as a matter of fact I have a little surprised for you Nicholas\nBilly movies with a Billy\nMan on the line Nick there you go\nHey good to talk to you good to talk to you too it's real good [laughter] better than talking to a dead grandmother so yeah [laughter]\nOkay you give us the bad bad man\nOh I'm working for you okay yeah I just need to tell you something buddy you're a bad man you're bad [laughter]\nThis is not changed all that much value really still waiting for puberty the strike what can I say\nIf you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and that I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we return to it's a good life with ... and my daughter lowly ana for it still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got sick notches on my belt when it comes to the tea zone\nWe knew you were in those episodes and they were being done was rod Serling around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when he did his you know bumpers and intros and ah [noise] yeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast\nOn the twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer buck out and we're really seeing kilo in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled\nControl from network hassling as much as they could uh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see a Mr Serling when he was on the set talked about what was coming up\nIn the next episode or so usually when an executive producer or creator comes onto was set and they were but it gets a little uptight yellow the you know or when Alan's here [laughter] or whatever but uh I recall quite clearly that a rod Serling was on the set everybody was delighted to be around to\nTalk with you\nYeah yeah sure we went out for margaritas every night\nAnd you know that's right and how old were you you're a little kid\nI was six or I was six and seven and nine\nThat's how did they find you really couldn't these parts\n[noise] um well actually the one of the very first lead roles I did was a an episode of Loretta Young show that was directed by James Sheldon the chorus Leishman played by mom and a and the director of that show brought\nMe and for the first twilight zone James Sheldon he brought me in for a long distance call and he also directed it's a good life so having to under my belt or I guess they just you know it's called me up for in praise of pets\nI ... the guy and you were you were in ... now what do you do in these days what's new\nWell a Angela car right now I've just released are novel a fantasy novel I think we talk to you about it when we were first writing and ... and go charge on purpose it's called the devil Sikhs revenge against and all the adversary has weapons\nWell you can sit yourself with Tom uh for the show OK\nYeah a lot to do that and I'm ... through an ancient aliens and you know I'm playing the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise] making music too\nYou know the belief thinks that's it you got it by George really moved me how to treat Nick ... that I was thinking George so that was great\nHe was a I did run certainly for you on this show you never know\n[laughter] he may my calling from the from the other side\nWhat inspired you to read the book about certainly\n[noise] well I mean I became a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just you know mesmerized by the show and and so that started everything\nAnd then really since then I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he's written a you know so much of it that was great\nAnd I I just wanted to collect all this information about all of these shows that he had written and and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually\nI'm dumb this type of thing where for example you know there wasn't even really a complete a list\nOf all the shows that certain rod Serling wrote that were produced television or or or film believe it or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had IRAs had you had gaps whatever but so that had never been done so the first thing I wanted to do is I wanted to know exactly what he wrote you know for his entire career that was produced in any form whatsoever so\nAnd then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that you know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been at it hadn't been commercially released\nUm I wanted to give that reader an idea of what these shows were about\nSo you know so that that was the idea behind the whole thing and then the book became you know it's part that is part you know a videographer you reference guide but it's also part biography in this part you know critical analysis of the themes certainly was was dealing with and the character types that he you know that he researched and you know built into in ...\nDid you come across anything that surprised you in your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes I'm probably the most surprising thing that I found was you may have heard of a particular shall we talked about the sponsors before and how they would you know butt up against sterling whenever he tried to do anything that was remotely controversial whether\nThere's one show that's particularly infamous in that regard it's called it's called noon on doomsday it was rather certainly attempt to tell some kind of version of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him and so it was a fourteen year old African American\nA boy who was lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman\nAnd this really just destroyed rod\nSerling she wants to sell some version of\nThe story and Everytime he tried to he you know he met resistance well I was able to find the ... the actual first draft of this script that rod wrote before\nAny of these um you know any of these uh interference is came into play and there have been several\nStudies of this particular show in the evolution that it's ... from from you know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on television well but none of those studies had the actual first draft and I just luckily found the actual first draft and that surprised me because I'll I'll spoil it for you and now\nIt's not all that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that\nMoon on doomsday controversies story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect rod Serling\nYou know it devastated and he was um you know superficially he was a Kennedy in ... he was he agreed with the politics and he he admired Kennedy but beyond that it was just it really you know I came across a letter that rotted written to um\nTo his ... pastor but he was a Unitarian of most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling was and he wrote a letter to one of his Unitarian a priest so to speak and and he just said how it just\nKind of it just took away his faith in humanity that something like this could happen he felt that we were going you know in a dark age in dark ages\nWhereas something like this could happen so it really it just yeah it it it's room for it threw him into a dark place for a little while and strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination he and William fruit that when the producers on this while its own were contacted by the state department\nAnd ask to produce a film to introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world\nWhile it was a document they needed a documentary they thought you know listen we got to get something quick that we can just send to our allies and present to people so you know here's here's the new president and so rod Serling the day after the assassination when he was you know depressed\nFlew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this documentary introduced President Johnson to the world\nSo he did that he finished uh\nYeah in fact the you know the uh\nThe the people who asked him to do this I said we ... we need this in five days [laughter] and and and William fruits have listened that's not going to happen we can't we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they you know as we said before either so prolific and he was so such a fast writer he did get through it pretty quickly and they had it they had it ready\nThat's driving drunk driving [noise]\n\nOh\n[noise]\n\n\nSeventy seven point one of the big sucker is Katie TK Katrina village Flagstaff Prescott Ninety seven point one little dig dug through more stimulating talk [noise]\nGathering ...

things right yes there's also it's not an imminent it's not like okay it's weapons of mass destruction for example to use one that works in the context where\nWhere we could be facing an imminent threat\nOf you know a bomb going off at a place that kills a lot of people that you know we might be able to stop this is ... if this is this is a prosecution of a crime\nRight in our eyes and if if they have actually killed this person\nThey need to be held responsible however we don't need to make that decision tomorrow no we need to make sure that we get it right we need to actually figure out all the dynamic going on just because it has a media feed on today does not mean we need to make a decision today are we actually take it seriously that affects only a media ... because it involved a reporter\n... yeah and and and the stories so traumatic as you point out what was it wasn't at first Hitchcock movie rather window right we're window I mean ... you know it's such a dramatic\nHollywood type crazy twenty four ah you know Jack Ryan story that you you wonder I mean it it capturing our attention which is is okay it's just that\nWe have to make sure we're looking at where the stuff is coming from right now it's coming from people with incentive to make Saudi Arabia look bad my guess is\nBecause I think Saudi Arabia they're not our friends they've done a lot of really bad things I'm this prince ... I mean getting remember this print took his own you know family members other princes hostage in a hotel and is likely a stole tons of their wealth\nIncluding planes and these specific planes are the ones accused of flying in and taking the remains out in suitcases so these are the\nPlanes the prince confiscated from other family members [laughter] I mean as he held them you know in the you know Ritz Carlton prison\nSo it's a legitimate worry that this guy is an absolute Kim Jong own style maniac\nAnd if that's happening with Saudi Arabia it's a lot worse than it is happening in you know in North Korea and a lot of ways I mean we already have a relationship with Saudi Arabia they're very influential in that region we know they do this but we know this stuff goes on in this region already and we deal with all these countries that that do it right but we just have to make sure that\nThere's no reason to feel pressure to not go through and intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation and you better take this tape seriously\nBecause if I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kinda finagle around and come to everybody down\nAnd then what everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I write the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you do you do the tape because it's that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're not friends of ours they are not friends of ours they are selling us crap that quite honestly I live in Texas we don't need it\n... and also I think to separate himself from his father rap feel mhm um put it that came then came really early and here's an Irish guy a chain\nAnd it applies to Spanish yeah trying to be more Hispanic and he he crazy he\nAlso went so far as back in twenty twelve try he tried to ah joined the Hispanic caucus in the Congress and you know [laughter] she didn't know he did yeah he tried to get into the Hispanic caucus because some of the El Paso residents his district is Seventy seven percent Hispanic\nSo some of the residents were upset that Sylvester race was no longer going to be in the pretty powerful Hispanic ... associates right but joined it they're like Mm no the nickname is not enough [laughter]\nReally I mean if we can go to the intersection analogy\nOf a Beto uh nobody's intersecting him no nobody's intersecting him he is still at the top of the hierarchy in the patriarchy\nPyramid I think one of my favorite parts of the debate last night was when Beto tried to make this case that every decision Ted Cruz makes it's about money so like he supports the second amendment and that's because of the n._r._a. and he supports this call\nAnd it's like you're you've brought in thirty eight million dollars of nations\nRight we're out raising cruised by what for two one five to one and a and of course as Cruz pointed out he's had plenty of special interest money come in and it just coming in through other names is coming in through a pack that he quote unquote doesn't control which we all know how that game goes\nI mean the idea that you're going to come out and making money an argument about how Ted Cruz is about money when the entire story arc of Beto is based on the fact that he can raise money well he's not competitive in this race he he has never won anything yeah\nShe is only in the race to run for twenty twenty I bet if he loses how is\nHe has he run for ... I don't know but there's still talking about it other than the euro was talking about him you know she\nIs she is that he's there John F. Kennedy ... Democrat hope right now and other may I say the great white\nHope yeah yeah yeah it's a it's been fascinating to watch this um\nHe also tried to a pin head up against Donald Trump says they have the big rally coming up what his next\nWednesday or Thursday in Houston and by calling him lay in bed like like Trump did and he said that's why the president called him lying dead and it's why his nickname stuck because it's true\nWhich is never it's never stuck in in evidence for never stuck it's never been true and what prompted him to say that about a battle was that he had voted for Bill that\nWould raise the price of oil twenty four cents a gallon to put a ten dollar surcharge on every barrel of oil which would raise the price about twenties or sent\nParents have gas depressing yeah yeah so a federal said that was true but he voted against a bill that would have stopped that bill so it really is true that he did he put the book and they can both kind of claim that they have\nThe truth on their side in that particular case\nUm but it was interesting to me because the CNN fact checked Beto on some things that he's been lying about during the campaign one being that his mother's a lifelong Republican loves this life long Republican right now you know because he's so wonderful and use\nSo uniting yeah she's gonna vote for him for the first time or the first time he's a life that in law on that first of all your mom\nIs going to vote for you while [laughter] water ... wow you got your mom right\nAnd then help me out because I think C. N. N. even looked into this way you did yeah yeah I voted\nFor a hard core Republican named uh Brock Obama in two thousand eight primary Obama yeah yeah now here ...\nThey're getting very ... [laughter] okay so here's the interesting thing I Love this part of the expos aid from CNN\nAnd she can't remember who who she voted for him to what he said he remembered ten years ago but not to [laughter] we're really you don't know who you voted for you know for Hillary and just didn't want to say it didn't want to say it\nShe couldn't if she voted for if she voted for Trump it wouldn't work to his advantage yeah\nShe was she was there so it was part of the Trump saying yeah you know she wanted change she won right as they would have worked ... voted out she voted for Obama in a way this lifelong Republican and then she can remember in sixty and\nThe other interesting aspect is that this lifelong Republican has voted in every single Democratic primary in Texas since two thousand\n[laughter] not at all I have even went so far as donating money to the Obama that [laughter] I I ... a\n... a federalist on this to a ...

know\nThe vice mayor just displayed the the\nIt was on the show every day yeah yeah well I like to bring up because I always check and\nI'm as you know the vice mayor just displayed the the um I always forget the name of this thing that the pitcher\nThe person I talked to say upside down flag five picture with the upside down the\nFlag that says I'm In dire distress right or I've had on folks talking about Martha McSally talked about it sort of wildlife and talk to them I'm bringing up with the governor I don't think I did with the governor should have right anyway I keep I keep asking folks as they come through\nI find it it's horribly offensive but let me preface she's allowed to do that sure sure okay First Amendment Reza ... but it's wrong right where do you agree with that\n... yeah I I wouldn't do it and I I understand where you're I think I think there are people okay now who are misguided and their their their their heart is in the right place and I'm not saying that I don't think she's trying to be disrespectful to America or or anything in that regard\nAnd and I the reason I ask ... twenty to and I'm old enough to remember the ... I Know what they were doing there were if you just look up some of the articles there were people freaking out about these flags being flown upside down and they said well we are in dire distress Obama's our president\nAnd their their you know and then of course that were veterans and stuff we were like very offended who are in the Tea Party so there was a split for both of those\nSo you know I definitely uh\nNot saying that the whole Tea Party believes and flying the flag upside down but there was a segment on as you did it they were wrong too that we're looking at the less Tea Party following the rights the partners footsteps\nAnd they're doing it I just said this about well and it's on her private page she's making a private statement and ah you know she has a right to do it she's doing it the right way\nIf she was doing it from the ... diet is like a you know council member who sober with each and every one of her pet causes\nThen I Would really be upset about it because what ... is doing is using her position um and and put a little mini billboards with her her special agenda which is it has nothing to do with what you know the capitals doing usually\nAnd so it it really is it seems to be just an abuse of power abuse of her position\nUm what ever they do on their private Facebook pages I really don't care\nI care because I I Want an explanation\nAs to why because she is a public she's the vice mayor Flagstaff and you can you are a public figure and I okay it's her private page now I haven't scoured through it to see if she talks about city council things on there or not but it is she's a public figure\nShe can do I I I Can't stress enough because they've got so many stupid emails on this one\nI'm not saying she can't do and she has a right to do it it's wrong and she it's almost like crying wolf and that and that is not and what if the Tea Party did it or if the right to do I would say the same\nOh yeah yeah you can say I wouldn't do and I just I think there's a lot of myths got people who actually genuinely feel like they are in dire distress and the countries in distress on it but but we survived eight years of Obama and they'll survive eight years of Trump and I say eight years 'cause it will be ... yeah yeah I mean the way that I mean\nWell hopefully to put up a ... one thousand twenty fourth warn\nHim I mean they already have fun campaign right I mean that was just waiting for that but I\nI I didn't I wasn't you know thrill during the Obama presidency a and I had plenty to say to be critical but I never thought it was the end of the world I figured we would get through it although\nIt may went a little more broken the law yeah a lot more broken more national debt more that's not that the than slowing down\nAnd not the Republicans do go on it yeah we have we have control of every single I'm Sal assigning jumped just put out a thing saying he wants to see his cabinet members come up with five percent cuts that would be nice but I think there's a concern they may lose Mitt terms and boy are they going to become fiscal conservatism of a sudden once\nIf that happens yeah that's my biggest disappointment\nThese last two years is um they're worse and I and I had an event with Congressman Paul go ... on the front lines ... yeah and and he he brought this up uh to me recently maybe it was on the show that we had control we blew it we could have done so much more I'm paraphrasing here but\nI mean yeah okay thank you for the tax a tax cut that's great but you have the judges and doing this and the Supreme Court and all that but you could have there's so much more right and that's the that's the only but under no illusion alive so that\nIf if the power goes back the other way it'll be a lot worse right and a lot scarier and\nThe national debt will go up even higher and yes it is just how how fast is it going to accelerate forward yeah let me ask you this\nUm before we go to break your eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one um I read this email earlier from Michael who is a forty year resident of Flagstaff why can't we complete our roads that currently go nowhere and he's talking about proposition for well these these taxes\nOr to build more wrote an introduction maybe we've got to ... why can't we complete our roads that currently go nowhere\nWhy can't we have budget proposition to spend money to get traffic on to more uh to to wider roads we currently have Jay W pal he names a bunch of things that are wrong that we've known if Ben round for a long time um I think one of these Michael one of these propositions actually\nTries to address that prop for for Nineteen 'cause he's talking about where you know you're driving down the road and for forty years it narrows down from foreign lands to to write write a letter always rich that why can't government just fixed that right you know what I'm saying I think for Nineteen is trying to address that\nBut I don't know if that address is it by name yeah this is the question is where is it really can where's it going to\nGo is it too vague right yeah is it hot eggs are very vague so Michael brings up some great points\nUm we have all these problems in a small town in a small city that's no longer a town like Flagstaff you see it in Sedona yeah I mean you've heard I've talked with folks from Sedona and they have this traffic nightmares why can't government fix this stuff and we give them gobs of money and they want more\n[laughter] that's [laughter] that's pretty that's pretty sad yeah\nOh\nYeah yeah All right hey oh [noise] well I just want to\nSay things are good at it or or before and after\nThat after\nYou Brian and here's what I'll do Brian because I have\nHad on a a dot wraps before um I'll bring in da da da da da di ... non political nine election things to get through hey Brian I'm Glad you're getting a tax return glad you're businesses is doing good and that you're able to uh take advantage of these things and tax cuts work appreciate you listening\n\nYes sir I appreciate your show\nAll right thanks Bryan it's seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one yeah leave money in people's pockets right and and get it back to a lot more people are going to get a benefit out of that [noise] then uh originally thought they were yeah oh yeah yeah yeah and I wish they could get a version to make them permanent\nOr you work on all of that but a lot depends on uh this election you know what happens with this election is maintain control over their um do you think that the\nDemocrats are going to get the house no I think Republicans are going to hold the house the Senate is iffy but I still thinking Republicans are going to hold it I think Kavanaugh was that moment\nI think it was a ... that really ticks people off it especially you're you're in the independent ... group of folks looked at it and said what the heck so certainly and and Republicans needed a moment to energize their voters and and that's what it was that's all it is\nOr where do we go here we want to try to get through some of these um how are you voting let's look at let's let's skip all over the place you let's start off with Flagstaff 'cause that's where you vote 'em you've got six candidates for council um and you have one of\nCandidate for mayor in one writing now\nSomeone called yes as a nice belt the write in candidate for Flagstaff mayor wrong again yesterday I don't know if I ...
