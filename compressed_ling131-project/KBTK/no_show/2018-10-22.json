the other end some what I'll be located\nYou mean to tell me that the death of Jamal ... has more impacted my life and the death of a police officer or the death of a truck driver or the murder of a college student in Iowa\nOr a school teacher or a child innocent kids are kidnapped and raped in America all the time young black men about seven hundred will be gone down in the south side of Chicago women are raped and brutalized tortured on a regular basis\n... inside of America much less in other parts of the world so why is the media focusing on a murder in Turkey\nBecause if it's a journalist excuse me ... was not a journalist there was a part time contributor to the Washington Post but even if he was quote a journalist\nDoes that have more value to me that a police officer or someone to someone I American soldier killed absolutely not\nYou know I I I'm waiting for the outrage from CNN about forty Mexican journalist murdered in the past two years in Mexico by drug cartels have you heard about any there you know who they are\nTo me the show the narrative as a hustle it's fake news it's a ploy used to attack Donald J Trump\nTo undermine his Middle East policy which is works so well they're exploring his death and weaponize thing is that as a cudgel against the Trump stir that's what's going on\nBut I guarantee you he his wife is no more value than a truck drivers lied for cops wife a soldier's life or waitresses lie for coal miners life a taxi drivers like all the might be murdered brutally tortured happens all the time\nIn American elsewhere so why is the death of a Saudi Arabian in Turkey big news\nBecause the media wants to use that as a club against the president and his Middle East policy and I think there's those at CNN and mainstream media that do not do not like the fact that Israel now has a friend in Saudi Arabia\nThey don't like that and I'm not a half million Syrians killed by Iran and by Russia by barrel bombs any of those lights up meaning the CNN no because it cannot be used as a weapon against this president they want to act as if\nWhen Trump says bad things about journalist some alley indirectly cause the death of democracy Yogi in Turkey who now believes is crap\nIt's unbelievable\nBut let's continue\nAlong becomes available to never does one eight six six six or seven seven three three seven the\nThing is tonight if we can focus on illegal migrants swelling to ten thousand found to reach the U.S supported by the Democratic party and found a vice rather an eastern media and the fact that you're ... if he was my father if he was my brother\nI'd be outraged at is that there was ... it should not have died\nSaudi Arabians do this all the time Syrians Iranians Iraqis inside of America there are several other black guys killed every year in Chicago and one hundred dead cops can you name one cop killed in America this year give me the name and your mind ... give me the name of one cup right now\nNPR ... which is subsidized by the taxpayer says the same way up look at the head of the past set of who's back because they understood oil as political opponents right both\nBush and Obama and Secretary Clinton looked at the other way at that guy because we needed to face the supply Afghanistan\nPlus ... says African Business conference that Obama held\nFor fifty African leaders and I think the daily mail newspaper looked at it and it was like whoa gallery of human rights violators and corrupt officials but you know the media like CNN and MSNBC and and\nThe are they just pawns over how the cradle bomber was reaching out to Africa not looking at the human rights background of the best part\nFortress African leaders so the whole thing is sick\nOr no and and you went over that quickly but use backers than had a leader\nWho would boil alive is political opponents and while that was going on Obama and Hillary Pussy footing around with this guy and the media that that was no big deal right they'll boil alive your political opponents that's okay because Obama\nHad the relationship and Heller had their relationship and use baggage than the media didn't cover that are all did they\nKnow and you know it's funny there are people on\nNPR that work to our to our to our show every week and and they make three hundred thousand dollars plus a year now see that's fine except I don't want to subsidize them you know ... you know why should we pay rent the ... PBS but you know like Facebook and Google and Microsoft Starbucks and Amazon\nLet them pay for it or people that like that in San Francisco or Boston but why is the average the horrible taxpayer subsidized in the yard that the clowns they have on that station on a regular basis with their little biased a\nAnd then there's hundreds hundreds of rent their ears and thousand radio stations there's five hundred television stations but we taxpayers subsidize PBS and NPR for what reason what what's the purpose is because they're left wing liberal Democrats and the Republican Party has no ... that's why it's done\nRight well I'm not for killing people but I mean he only works you know like it's not a nice after utopian world it's like brick set a\nA cross of walk I Do my wife is very cheap around the world and you know but people who pick and choose their atrocities and there does spots or should come down and and that's the media thank you\nAnd your great thank you for your call is go to Jim in Chicago the belly of the beast gym in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Jim go ahead\nThings are just to let you know I uh I have a home in San Pedro Sula Honduras and I'm also a resident of the country and I'm totally opposed to what's growing up and going on\nAnd tell me since you you spend time in Honduras talking about the circumstances and violent the economy is it's\nIt's kinda like it because if you live in Chicago yeah 'cause I live in Chicago it all you hear about from people that love other places they ... they're talking about Al Capone of violence but it's like any section you know there's a lot of wonderful places there sure there's a lot of civilian areas however\nPart of the problem is the government there doesn't do things well they think like Obama they just want to raise taxes\nFor example if you go to a restaurant or food is Fifteen Percent sales tax on food and if you order like a like a drink it's Eighteen percent tax for a drink at a restaurant you know and plus the value of the ... been sliding to the dollar itself to twenty four limbs per dollar used to be just a few years ago it was like twenty\nOr June had announced the guy is the government democratically elected what is it\n[noise] well this last election there was a big uh uh the same as to his initials or a jail wage\nBecause he used to be before Honduras just had one term for four years [laughter] and then when the bomb was president he somehow was able to get the legislature to make a two terms and people just liked it and there was a lot of writing in the streets in fact they closed 'em [noise]\nUh they're they're called the ... they're called wealth is\nWhat they did is they closed all the highways and stuff so people couldn't get to the airport and actually suspended flights in San Pedro a couple of times because of that [noise] and and what they did this last time he'll they have these these like toll booth leaving the city there's three ... three major toll booths [noise]\nUh and they they just burn them out they just destroyed the buildings and the toll booths are no longer collecting tolls\nAnd that's a that's a major hit you know and and that's that's just it's amazing when I was down there the one time I couldn't actually get home I had to wait for two days\nAnd you could hear the gunfire in the background because San Pedro was like a huge valley surrounded by mountains\nOr did you what is the what's the life of the average Honduran what's it like\nWell if you have money you do well if you're poor or you don't want to be there because there is no public assistance to the public hospitals are Laden with cockroaches [noise] but you know there's a lot of beautiful restaurants there the food is wonderful you know it's it's so it's like it's mixed\nYou know I've been going there for thirty something years in fact my ex wife I'm a his from there and that was part of the attraction I went there and I have two daughters with her they're teenagers now and I'm Still good with my my inlaws and thinks it's nice but you know you got to be careful you don't want to do that business deal with anybody because it's a good chance we can get hurt\nOkay now now you said you're against Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and Nicaragua is coming to America why are you against it\nWell it doesn't serve a purpose you know the same energy you see a lot of this has been funded by these left us he'll George Soros types and and you know they should spend the same energy and resource to try to fix what's wrong in their own government\nSaid in your country and fix your own country while he's in wind leaving the best and brightest might be leaving you leave behind those who can't function so it's really in the long term mental that's what happens a lot of people\nWide leaving the best and the brightest might be leaving you leave behind those who can't function so it's really in the long term interest that's what\nHappens a lot of people with means a lot of hunters actually have gone to Spain\n[noise] yeah\nAnd a lot of them come illegally here in fact I'd say it's one of my good friends actually got killed about five years ago he was involved in a bad car deal the transaction [noise] and he got off right people got killed right before Christmas\nSo you don't go there and you get a gun to kill somebody\nYeah and his brother actually had a tourist visa and he left his beyond here in California for the last five years he ... he gotta you're going to get married is going to try to get the paper that these are the marriage so a lot of people with resources have left and come over here and then try to stay or go\nBy getting married he was doing something else to become legal\nRight it's it's a big problem he also down there you know their energy consumption they keep raising the price for for electricity it's all diesel powered a pill generation it's not efficient as expensive and they keep raising the price of energy\n[laughter] you know my water bill's gone up like fifty percent of the last four or five years\nSo it's a broken society nothing's working and it's getting well is it\nThat nothing but it could be better manage just put it that way\nBut who's doing the energy is that a military a democratically elected it doesn't matter and Honduras\nWell the president was actually reelected the second time but a lot of people thought he stole the election that's why there's a lot of writing the streets and that's why they had these strikes you know\nBut that's all kind of I don't know what the problem is you know they keep raising the prices of everything [noise] so if you're if you're stuck down there and you're not you don't have a job where you can be tied into dollars so to speak you know things keep getting out of sight it's just like that as well\nAs bad as well but the whole thing with inflation and try to keep up with stuff\nGetting oysters about thirty eight forty million people who live in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Nicaragua about thirty five to forty million how many would come to America given a choice of the Democrats got in charge and a complete open borders how many would come\nBy privacy mall [laughter] all of them [laughter] forty million right that would come\nBut you know it's funny because there's also a lot of there's a lot of a love for American hunter stores you're like ... American flag you're ... you're on the wall she lives there so there had of fact I was even that does is getting off the site or a little bit I was thinking it would be good to make hunter as the fifty first date of you know like oh my God [laughter]\nThe reason why is because people if we if we could come and run their country and give her local government it would people would jump to that and they would be more patriotic\nAnd your name is Jim thank you but here's impact during the violent death writing on doors at Ninety five per one hundred thousand\nNine of the ten most violent

gives proud life in this world okay that doesn't sound secular doesn't sound like somebody we should be in bed with\nBut the Muslim Brotherhood ran up against a problem and that was one of them the kingdom of\nOf Saudi Arabia because it was backed by the west any of these kingdoms in the middle East that have been backed by the west Jordan will be next anybody who stands in their way\nThey had to destroy but these were democracies so how are we going to do it well the Muslim Brotherhood decided to switch tactics and weaponize democracy\nEnter the Arab Spring\nThe Arab Spring praised by everyone we told you their goal is a caliphate while it never materialized did it\nNo no not there it materialized from the chain of events with ISIS\nWhat you were talking about the Muslim Brotherhood right and what happened to the Muslim Brotherhood\nDid they just choose not to do a caliphate oh no no\nThey were overthrown oh\nThe Muslim Brotherhood still wants their caliphate\nSo now you have two of our allies turkey Muslim Brotherhood the Saudis while hobbyists who are both ... chasing the same exact dream a Middle East and the world dominated by surreal law both of them Ewing

he\nEverybody here all it's a Saudi progressive fighting for democracy no\nNo no no\nHe was fighting for the Muslim Brotherhood\nIn the Nineteen eighties and nineties he was one of the king's main

to be published\nA an article critical to the ... hobbyist\nMovement why did he do that\n... because he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and they were at odds with the well hobbyists\n\n... was cast aside and that's when the western media fell in love with him an active\nMember of the Muslim Brotherhood not us smear or conspiracy theory in his own words yes I joined the Muslim Brotherhood organization and I was not alone\nAnd quote\nHis Muslim Brotherhood friends in clerics were all in prison in Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring\nHe got out he came to the U.S he established a political party while in exile called democracy for the Arab world now party\nThe liberals the progressives the press loved him because they heard the word democracy it's the Muslim Brotherhood plan to subvert democracy like turning it against itself\nHe wants wanted to establish sharia law in the region\n\nHe was also a wicked anti Semite who wrote quote outside the context of history and logic the Jews will have to die by force\nOh\nIsrael's outside the context of history and logic are we going to have to kill all of them this is not a smear campaign when you hear somebody say that you make sure you asked them where are you doing your homework where are you getting that why is that a smear campaign\nTo say that he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly was in his own words so why is that a smear campaign because I thought the Muslim Brotherhood was largely secular\n\nAsked people how much do you know about the caliphate how much do you know about the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood how much do you really know about what this man wrote\nThis man wrote that he ... it was a mistake\nTo think that you could have any kind of state in the middle east with out some form of

... seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one open lines would love to hear from you it's seven seven Ninety seven one three\nNinety seven one All right let's talk about this caravan\nUm Jerry I mean you've got some reports seven thousand folks it's growing\nAh people are leaving Central America heading up through Mexico um and now Trump saying hey we're going to cut off foreign aid I Want to address the foreign aid issue of you've been you've been hearing from people if people are like well wait a second they're heading towards us I mean what's gonna happen here\nWell I it it has been the topic of discussion and I'll tell you that Jeff for sure and and I heard\nSome people said today that well if this seven thousand has any success in a couple of weeks there'll be Fifteen thousand ... that\nThat any success encourages more and how do we handle that\nAnd look what's happened to the European countries that kind of look down their borders and it's greed you accept immigrants from you know countries in that area especially from Africa and\nAll of a sudden there are just overwhelmed\nAnd the people are the the national people are rebelling\nYeah but it's I mean\nThe reason why you see it okay you got seven thousand people this happening all the time though it's just your happening to see the ... the mass of people but we didn't get to twelve million plus by some estimates illegal immigrants in this nation by two or three people coming over time there's\nJust people pouring over left and right and we'd let this happen and in a way what you're saying is if you let the seven thousand now how does that pretend to the future you know what I'm saying because we've already been doing it so they they're like we can go it it's allowed\nWhat if you're not for the wall then I have a question for you what happens if the country literally gets stormed with thousands of people to just go hey we're coming across ... catch us all on\nOn November seventh we're all coming well Trump my he's already talking about sending military down to the border of course some people are saying hey you can't do that of course she can do that of course he can do that it's been done before I mean\nI'm not saying this is happening I'm not saying this and they've been indicating this is going to happen but we've invaded Mac and we've gotten into Mexico for reasons in the past\nOr you have to go uh always back\nBut of course he could send folks to the border\nAnd especially when they're saying hey we're coming we're coming we're coming\nNow let's address the money issue and folks you want to chime in on this issue eight seven seven cars this could have a big impact on Arizona eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one um Trump President Trump said something about hey let's get rid of the uh foreign aid to countries like Guatemala which I think was\nOn top of my head I think it was two hundred and sixty million or so that that's going down there it varies by year it's been very high in in certain years but a lot of Central American countries\nLike a lot of countries around the world get a lot of our tax dollars are get foreign aid and obviously it's not doing much good because people are\nFleeing now I don't agree with cutting off the foreign aid here me out because I can see the phones ring up on this issue when I say this I don't agree and cutting off the foreign aid because there's a immigrant migrant care of and coming up through Mexico that's just not my trigger point\nI don't think there should be any foreign aid going down there at all it should be cut off just because let me throw this number out before you\nTwenty one and a half trillion dollars we have a national debt of Twenty one and a half trillion dollars why are we giving money to any countries in foreign aid when we have that kind of debt and tens of millions of dollars in unfunded liabilities\nSo I I agree with President Trump that it should be cut off but it should have been cut off a long time ago I was a lottery said for that and now here's somebody\nI was discussing that with earlier and they said well if we don't give that foreign aid will it damage say Guatemala's economy even more so even more people will be storming the United states border\nI don't think so I think it comes to a point where those people have to decide that and I I don't know what I the conditions I I Know the conditions than there are rough especially some of the Central American countries\nLike many countries around the world and there's a very it's a tiny percentage of the people that do very well often times because of this foreign aid Jerry ... whether you want us to you and same thing they\nBecause it takes a long time to pay it off you know get all of that eighty million up front I'm a no no I'm I'm going to stake my because I get lots of emails asking count voting I Can't support a eighty million dollar bridge with forty million interest I just can't do it you know I just can't do it\nFor Twenty one do we need more buses more often that's what it is more stops does that help\nThe traffic you know what a Jeff mild back say about that\nYou know or if you use it and this and that I may be but I I just and a regard you also when you take sides of the things that you buy that\nMm no because there's more cars on the road now I mean I think people use it but I think it's getting used up with the growth of any use things like that are now any you said promised to buy a million dollars worth of um passes for the students which is good I mean it's still ... a lot of taxpayer money are doing OK I'm\nThis is the one I'm struggling with because I Am\nLike a lot of folks you're talking to Jerry I'm generally a no on all these taxes because I'm like when is enough is enough it's kinda like I Am with the foreign aid you know we've got so much debt so many ... and what happens if there's another recession but there's for Nineteen which is a community\nI'm Sorry for Seventeen the community this Coconino county issue community college\nAnd I'm actually I'm a surprise me if I'm actually leaning towards the yes on this one because I see the college that problem I see the challenges with a huge university like any you you have a a shoe and locally people do not have much control over this organization\nI'm so maybe there's a benefit to how getting the community college I have heard people say that if they could be sure that it would go to the technical classes as a community college has has promised\nThey would be in favor of it well they said that was going to be a lot of it more programs I don't know if it's all technical stuff I mean it's probably ... I had a um the president of the um community college calling Smith was on interviews up and talk with Jeff dot com\nUm and that was a big thing is trying to get more programs I and I look at it as my kids going to college this is not selfish\nMy kids going to college and I'm like why wouldn't you go for two years and get some of these are ... out of the way or if you're not college material go learn a trade if there's if that's an avenue why not take it in a junior\nCollege can show you whether you were college material pretty quick and\nThen it's true and and so community colleges are great you know certainly uh any college any entity can use as much money as they can give you a yes on for Seventeen I think I Am\nNearly you're you are yes and I'm leaning that way so your thoughts folks eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one state wide\nDid I miss them locally let's switch to state and oh by going to miss that will come back to the okay and we come back let's

is trying to change the constitution and they're all in favor of it and well there's a lot of folks in favor of that because the proposition one twenty six the ban on sales tax on services there is
