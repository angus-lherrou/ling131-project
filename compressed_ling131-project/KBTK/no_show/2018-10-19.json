had a little girl\nShe was only nine years old when her father he was an MP the officer died while saving as many lives he could from the flaming World Trade\nCenter officer Raman\nFor as was forty five and his partner Marc ours were posted on the lower east side of the city when they are the two planes had crashed in the building the two police officers didn't hesitate to respond\nThey got a taxi in rush to the same\nAs far as ran into the north tower three times he was able to save in a asthmatic woman as well as a woman who was seven months\nPregnant the cool part is there were pictures of the police officer doing this heroic work that are still around today\nHe never returned from his third entry into the building the tower collapsed before he could escape\nUm that officer or\nPut his safety of his own life ahead or behind others and went in to protect people\nPolice commissioner James O'Neill reflected on that day during the most recent NYPD police academy graduation ceremony saying even now Seventeen years later none of us have completely come to terms of what happened that day and I don't think we ever will\nBut this particular graduation ceremony was a reminder of the good that has come as a result\nOf those attacks\nThat little girl who was nine is now twenty six Jillian for as we're sitting among the two hundred and forty nine police officers who graduated this

would have been a professor teaching at all of these courses if it wasn't for her lying at the ivy leagues about who she actually was and what her heritage actually was\n\nOne eight seven seven three

I Would pay that off and I would hold twenty bucks for an emergency but the rest as your down payment if I were in your shoes I Would not buy a house with the still laying around I think that's dangerous you're asking for trouble and so uh so\nMy vote is going on your side of this argument I'm afraid but I don't know I honestly I don't know why she would answer listen to make now let me tell you this I Will tell you that I Would not do any of this unless you guys get on a budget and you agree to never borrow money again\nOkay yes that I have a track to talk to her about that I'm actually a new economic trying to get here on board mhm she's not really to come veins about also having trouble getting her on board with the plan as well you know\nI can imagine so um\nI I I highly recommend you don't do anything\nUntil you can come into agreement\nOkay because you're going to make a mistake when you Shannon I when we have an argument like this we uh we have to we have a rule we have to do nothing until we can come into agreement\nOn large purchases large gifts large decisions we decide nothing is the only thing we can do until we're in agreement\nAnd ah so I I recommend you do nothing until the two of you can get on the same page um do you think that she would go to financial piece university if I gave you a one year membership\nI honestly do think I've been talking to her mother trying to help me out just because she's so stubborn about this and her mother is on my side as well\nAs on what I ask what I asked\nWhile they're trying to help me out just because she's so stubborn about this and her mother is on my side as well\nI don't want to ask what I asked was can you get your wife to go to financial piece university to the nine lessons and if I give you the one year membership Yes sir you think so why she's pressure off of it\nI think that me and my me and her mind would sit down with her and explain to her um\nGo to the climate is free okay I'm going to give it to you but I'm only going to give it to you on the condition that she attends with you\nOK because if you go by yourself it will cause a divorce is you're going to get more and more and more and more excited about getting out of debt and living with a plan and you get it's going to drive a wedge further between you own I don't want to do that\nSo I just if you can talk her into just attending one or two classes with you I think she'll go on and go to the others I'm pretty persuasive but ah but\nDon't go by yourself there it'll cause problems hold on I'll have Kelly pick up\nI'll give you the financial ... membership for a year and that includes the nine lessons that you can attend and you can watch them on line and everything else um but do not do this without her it's a it's contingent upon that my gift is All right Dave is with us in Stockton, California Hi Dave how are you\nOh good afternoon Dave how're you doing gray\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nWith that that's good Faye I'm with my wife and I are at Pew coordinators how we treat debt free\nAnd we major wisdom and guide or something where we also have a little disagreement um last year she got her son got very loaded with money to help them out really knowing that yea going that we would never probably see the money again okay um\nWhy would you do that you're in a University of ...\nI you know what that's a good question [laughter] that's a good question I maybe it's because I haven't talked for about a year I lost touch with every with that aspect of it but um we volunteer to pay for true class which they did\nBut in the end they didn't discipline Metallica all kinds of all and Henri building a ... kind of at all mhm well\nAfter six months we decided to see what kind of make the U.S back

I worked for the service they have to get a loan debt of like um about Fifteen thousand dollars [noise]\nAnd um [noise] I'm Joe friends one of them as I'm\nAsking me to go for a business\nOr like a friend um subway business so I was thinking about taking a loan for that and my other friend if I'm all for me like to go buy a house with him and check the share like a two family house so I take one apartment he takes the other\nAnd it's going to be of course with a mortgage loan chose so I wanted to know what should I Do [laughter]\nMm okay well we tell folks not to borrow money around here if you listen to the show very much\nThe shortest path to wells and peace in your finances is to avoid that and on top of that I Would tell you to avoid partnerships as the only ship that won't fail so hum\nWhat that means is that if you still want to remain friends with both of these guys I Would suggest you say no because at the end of the stories are nightmare\nGoing in partners with somebody in debt to go into the restaurant business would you all know squat about is a good way to end up bankrupt and lose your friendship forever going in partners want somebody to buy a house\nAnd then he doesn't pay is half or can't pay is half or you don't pay your campaign you're half is a precursor to the ending of a friendship and a foreclosure\nShown no I wouldn't do either one of those and that's my reasoning I think you'll have a lot better life if you avoid both of those paths\nAnd you can you can develop a career path that does not involve you're going into debt to start a business it's a matter of fact most businesses start without that\nThey just start small\nWe started this one without the card table my living room we didn't have a big fancy studio we went down to the local radio station drove over there and they let us use their stuff because we work for free there\nWell you figure out a way to get going and you what we call bootstrap it and it works\nBut you don't have to go get an SBA loan and go deeply in debt about subway franchise in order to be in business that some mythology Thomas is with\nUs in Philadelphia Hi Thomas how're you\nDave thank you very much for taking my call sure what's up\nI'm I just graduated with a degree in ... science back in may wow and I'm working at McDonald's making nine dollars an hour why I I've been applying I'm applying and I just I Can't find a job and I don't know what to do [noise]\nMm [noise] well I I Would assume that the primary job for that would be an insurance companies correct\nYeah I I've [noise] through the end of my last year of school I got very turned off the actual real science so I've been applying to finance jobs and I\nCan't get anything because everyone should have an aunt you have experience and I don't have the experience and I I graduated early so I did\nI did summer classes and they can't do internships on the hospitals are so kind of any kind of an angel job or you tried into\nFinancial analyst financial I'm like I've\nI've been even doing accounting like accounts payable any mhm receivables\nEntry level stuff mhm are you there is get your foot in the door I'm OK well here's\nHere's one thing I Will tell you and Ken Coleman will tell you this is will go to the Ken Coleman show dot com and download his free PDF\nOn how to put together a resume but resumes in applications without relationship are useless um I'll give you an example uh we have eight hundred people here just under a hundred people work on our team we hired a hundred and fifty to two hundred last year we had Fifteen thousand the applications\nFor those honored hires\nYou get lost in that ... and it's not that I don't wanna answer and talk to every one of those Fifteen thousand people is just logistically not reasonable\nAnd so what ends up happening is you get lost in the stack of that stuff unless you know someone that works there and you don't have to be best friends with them you just 'cause I got to tell you we don't ever hire somebody because somebody called me and says are\nEver but we would give them an interview\nAnd pull their pulled the resume out of the stack you got to get out of the pile you know and so some of these places you're trying to get on with you need to figure out if your sister that's married a kid play soccer where the guy that works over there\nOr something like that where you can find someone that will put in a little bit of a word for you to at least get the door open\nAnd that'll get you in the door\nAgain you're you're not going to get hired because of that kind of a reference matter of fact there are very few references where you just calls up somebody and I get your hired at almost never happens that'll decent job anyway\nI mean if they're hiring just bodies you can get on with something like that but at a good job they're really going to want to interview you and what about you and that would be true here so we don't guarantee anybody a higher but we will at least talk to them\nAnd you know what might be a very short conversation no you don't qualify investment or looking for at least we'll all go and get the resume out of the trial\nIf somebody knows I'm Sorry go download that and listen to the kids home and show he'll help you with all this stuff is very very difficult out there but I think you can leave some\n[noise]\n\n\nWhy in the world would you trust some random guy in a Q when getting your mortgage\nLuck in the ... story very well done thank you very well done well you did exactly\nWhat I Try to get doctors to do most dogs come out and go finally worked all this time I've gone to school my whole break in life mhm I deserve\nA new house or a new car I deserve a trip and they spend money like water you've seen them do it oh yeah definitely and I it's crazy understood all you do would you you just kept living like a broke college student\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first few years out because that was really the easiest time to do it and so I think that was probably the most important stuff that I thought you know 'cause\nNow I I mean you make three hundred four hundred five hundred wherever you make it you're going to be unbelievably weapons so you said your how thirty thirty one thirty one oh\nWe'll just fabulous and congratulations thank you I'm so proud of you who was your biggest cheerleader I Know you had to have good tractors that was easy yeah but who is the biggest cheerleader\nOr I Would say my parents or my mom had followed you for years and also people in my church family as well because they I talk a lot about you and we're encouraging me not to look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans\nYeah yeah so I mean you went from being completely crushed by student loan debt to completely owning it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the day I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it was even going to be possible to get out but I didn't really have\nAnother planet I figured I'm just going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later I Am a final payment\nYeah you paid off almost two hundred thousand a year for two years ...

you're happy defined it briefly\nWell I think possibly and I asked myself that maybe greener big enough to believe but I'm I'm happy to be [noise] I ... my business close to home I don't travel a lot

cruise almost wrote an entire book on content that content that does not mean\nThat you're in a bad place I think you're happy you're thankful you're you're grateful you've been able to work hard and get into a new space I think what you're feeling is the pitch to continue to challenge yourself and by the way that is also a good feeling you can be content meaning I'm grateful for what I have\nBut I'm not happy with who I Am so I'm very content I\nI honestly living the dream this is the greatest time of my professional life I'm having a blast however\nI'm not happy with who I Am as a husband I'm not happy with who I Am as a father meeting I can be better so I can be convenient and grateful but also want to continue to improve when I got a great business I don't know I think\nYou become a successful yeah amounts to indirect regulations well done\nUm the thing I did when I kinda hit the same place you are was I started the first stage of business and you passed it substantially is to take care of your family and to survive off the end for the business to survive and they don't you get asked once you get past the desperation\nOf that stuff and uh then the thing starts to you control some of the variables and you brought in somebody to do some of the work you didn't want to do and you brought it closer to home and you're making good money and and show that that's the next step and that's what I Do as an example\nUh when I hit that stage people started saying well you'll never be successful radio if you stay in Nashville all the big radio shows are in New York or LA and I'm like well am I going to be a big radio show then 'cause I'm not going to live in New York or LA I don't find visiting people but I'm not living there\nI like Nashville and uh well you got to have them I mean I have a seven minute commute and I live in a huge freaking house I'm not leaving [laughter] you know so that you know that's where you get to so then I started to go how can I expand this without how can I expanded and scale it without destroying the parts that are finally achieved\nYeah and so can you hire some people can you expand your product lines can you make it digital or I mean what can you do to grow the business\nBut do it from a position of content ... now that you've got the variables controlling\nAnd that's that's the way to go at it so I think you're doing great man

when we were a member of something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about is how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step process to sharing a dream of a story that makes it sound you can get it done and minutes\nYou get some help feed back in your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our genes I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it to be let out so the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family we think that we should lie in the church in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch it means good time to talk on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams you know sometimes this is very interesting\nSometimes he kissed goodbye to our dreams because we think that our dreams are giving us a little ring pictures\nOf possibility that we cannot none of us because they're not young enough to not rich enough but never find the right girl or the right guy and sometimes strangely we kiss goodbye to dream because we don't think we can bring from a beautiful romantic breathing space\nWhat we would like to see an are waking life these are some of the reasons that people lose their dreams\nAnd I noticed that you know if you follow the the simple suggested that I also you can get your dreams that you can stop dreaming again in the sense of remembering and recalling and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think you've got nothing but some say you've got nothing and just pay attention you might have a with you might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's\nRather than the you can dream wide awake welder rounds you will speak the language of signs and symbols than good is if you pay attention and sometimes you get more alert to the pop up so that like pop ups in waking life that can get shivers cause you feel my gosh there's a hidden handed work that that helps to turn on the dream plus the night as well\nAs some incredible wage the dream pre cognitive lucid dreams what about these recurring dreams and you have had some stories are directly related to that\nWell it's a recurring dream is coming again and again and there's a hilarious story a mysterious realities about a woman doctor from England who's complaining of the brain\nWell it's a recurring dream is coming again and again on as a hilarious story a mysterious reality is about a woman doctor from England who's complaining of the breakfast table\nOh Robert why do I keep having the same as the dream when I got to do my medical exams Thirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you if it really is the same ... very close to the same dream it's probably because\nYou have dreamed producers who are making a movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through you're trying to get you to understand the situation and trying to educate you all assuming you might have some clue about what's going on there trying to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I I did one of the stories\nI I picked a sort of dream production movie company that is making dreams for us and repeating the performance if necessary in order to get a message across and I actually picked how I'll dream producers might be getting very bulletin fed up with us if they have to keep on making the same\n[laughter] but just in not getting the message of not taking action from it that's one of the ways that ... come about I mean dreams that not all to be put in one box we do have dreamed productions where you feel and you might be quite right when you filled is that there is a production crew behind the scenes that\nIs making a certain kind of dream you because you need to get a message and another the stories of mysterious reality as I describe a very strange women who sat down next to me and the plain old reality and\nMentioned me at a certain point that the debt husband or the ... he was a pop musician he'd been shot in the face and a diner in Seattle on the knees\nCreepy story and he says to her in her dream I'm I've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies for people that they'll see in their dreams that I'm doing the music and the special effects\nOn the fact that goes on I think that's another fascinating aspect\nOf what's happening and dream who's in charge of this though who's who's the director these productions\nWell that's a very good question indeed it might use that dream or if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you become conscious it might be that some shadow or hit an aspect of yourself\nMaybe of your highest self maybe a site the wiser and fight the highest though\nIs the director I don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this I think the dream production company that might be staging movies for you is not alien to you is not hostile to you and is probably being run by someone with a slightly why is the perspective and\nMaybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about your current situation because one of the ways that dream shock us awake into doing some course correction is they dramatized and they spoof parity or what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing that some action might be required\nDreams are powerful Robert in a eyeball we used it for my own personal life to get things done accomplish things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no end to what you can do\nThat's right I mean I think that\nHere's here's where our current understanding of dreaming and currents physics or meet up I mean the our current understanding account understanding I mean there really is ready to revive quite ancient understanding about dreams of dreaming is traveling for example\nA physics tells us science tells us that we have access at any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're the field of information quantum field of information that contain everything we could ever possibly need to know and we have access to it\nAccording to our ability to have this information and do something with it in ... in the first place what's going on I think in dreams we discover the personal doorway into this whole onto them information field\nAnd depending on the work and play with prepared to do with the information might getting we can bring through more and more I mean you can set an intention any night for example it'd be very simple about this is simply a practical you can do dream in ... means you set an intention\nTo get guidance on any theme that interest you and probably something will come through if you don't think you've got anything you're awake in the middle of the night to reset your intention and maybe at this point\nYou're ready to lose a dream on that subject as well because he's got some rest and you're ready to take off\nAnd it's amazing how many creative solutions come through in this way and they've come through across his ... one of my book the secret history of dreaming is full of store narratives from the documentation that suggested dreaming is actually a secret engine in the history of everything and the history of great breakthroughs in science\nAnd technology in the aughts even in business and economics as well so when you say that if you wake up to what dreaming is it can take you anywhere you are literally correct it really can can\nTake us to the hidden dimensions of reality that super string theory pause it it can take us into the off the lights the UCs the hand want the job opportunities some living environment a like\nA bee on death so you can talk to an ancestor beloved loved ones and ... and others so you know this is the ... the other venture killing guidance and possibility that opens when you become a more conscious ...\nWhat about the ability to time travel in your dreams\nWhere we do it we do it whether we know it or not they do it even if we don't remember our dreams and I think it's a basic survival function of dreaming\nYou know if I'm a mistake on the practical mystic George I think you know that I won't take away is this that in power out everyday life and one of the things I Know from my own life and those I work with is the dream show you the future in a way that is actionable mean this is very important dreams shows\nOpportunities and challenges that lie ahead there with us is the things we don't yet know about\nThey can save your life they can save your job they can save your marriage I couldn't be talking to you today if I did not know for certain shows that I have that I have avoided death on the road predates his death ... accidents\nBy coming back from dreams that forecasts but it was happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with the Eighteen wheeler coming down the hill to file on the other side of a\nBlind spot for example so that's one direction for time travel but time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact\nTo understand what our relationship with the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of Libya time altogether we stepped into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times when you're leading a power live this becomes very interesting when you begin to look at gifts and lessons you might have learned in a parallel lives that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and that that other parallel life\nAnd it gets very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost at that time\nWill be guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives in situations of people in ... places to a part of your multi dimensional family I'm a bit of

latest work is called mysterious realities how many books have you written Robert\nThis is the ... the old way George but I must tell you I'm getting nervous because I Dreamed sometime ago I have a life contract that says I have to probably sixty eight books\n[laughter] a short of that that's still pretty prolific\nThough good for you good for you and they're ... they're all fascinating works that\nThese dreams are so important I mean I I think people can you make themselves healthy and a dream that you can get a better job in a dream they can make other people think about them by concentrating on them and dreams it's amazing what you can do with dreams isn't it\nAbsolutely and your list and some really interesting areas for example in terms of how I mean one of the things going on in dreams of that that body talk as well as social in other words and dreams we see what's going on inside the body and old fashioned doctors understand this and in traditional Chinese medicine for example this is front and center\nIdea is that a dream my gives an X ray even an MRI of what's going on inside the body might show symptoms that are developing that maple is to avoid those symptoms but\nThat's one of the functions of framing and the and in terms of our emotional and spiritual health\nI'll dreams which shows the things that helped us to get wild him to stay relevant ended with acting up on those dreams of trying to bring their energy true you mentioned connecting with other people were you know till after the which literally means fellow feeling at a distance or or or being in touch with someone else it's\nA common phenomenon and dreams in fact it's surprising that more people who are related to each other either by Lovell by family or by common colds or whatever\nI'm not aware more often that they might be dreaming with ... and all of each other I mean there's the phenomena shed dreaming or interactive treatment which we find ourselves sharing adventures\nFriends and other people I mean this is another fascinating phenomena and dream as a matter of fact you discover if you wake up your dreams remember more look at what's going on\nBut you have what used to be coded as being cold again stupid normal capacity abnormal but not supernatural but that'd be on the normal and we're talking about things like pre cognition\nUntil after the ... and and so on and and and and you are able to see things before they happen right with the things that just didn't Bible to connect with other people and these are natural powers and abilities that belong to you and if you become a more active dream and you'll find that you are growing in developing these gifts and the very helpful in life\nIn terms of creative solutions for things greens will deliver them you can't find a solution to a problem or me alive\nPut the question to your dreams and see what come and I would add to that that you can do this every day life as well because dreaming for me it's not just about what happens when you close your eyes it's what happens when you open your eyes wider so proud of this part of part of the fence with all this is\nBut the world around you once again we'll speak to like a dream if you pay attention so I encourage people or many of my story is done on this\nTo notice what goes on in the main thing moments of meaningful coincidence when you've got a photo preoccupation on your mind and suddenly the will deliver the incidents are finding that gives you not only a reflection of what's on your mind but sometimes\nA way of dealing with what is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I encourage people to play is\nPut your question to the world go down the street or go to the talk of go your morning commute\nBut that question in your mind and received the first unusual unexpected thing to enter your field at the steps and as a message from the use of the surrounds you it is amazing how specifically the world will speak to you delivering a dream like message when you play that game\nIn Nineteen Seventy one Robert I did my first radio audition tape and ... and I had it on tape and I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid and hire them to be some radio person on the street reporter and ah what I Would do what I\nThis young kid and hire them to be some radio person street reporter and what I Would do when I dropped it off at a certain radio station I wanted to work at I concentrated on that person every night when I went to bed or he already had my tape I hadn't heard from him\nA mature enough after two days I'm going to sleep concentrating on the individual\nVisualizing what he looks like I had met him one time and uh sure enough two days later the guy calls me and says hey I'd like to have when I got something for you come on down it works doesn't it\nYes wow you're send your ... your manifested George I'm not surprised one bit you know Mark Twain staged experiments of this guy he called them mental ... feedback in his day when people said telegrams\nHe'd make a habit of writing a letter or an old fashioned telegram to someone he wanted to be in contact with a not mailing it he just ... on\nThe edge to them that goes unnoticed what followed the news that that actually almost didn't celebrate that was a response so you're practicing a game that is an angel and it works I mean we know the thoughts are already thing\nThey're already thoughts and feelings are already action\nAnd if you're thinking about another person you're probably going to reach them unless they are shielded again being reached I mean you are reaching out but nine right to do something good we wouldn't want to be able to be reached by just anybody with with any intention but that's a lovely creative and benign example of sending of mental sending medical ... is what Mark Twain\nAnd I you know I subsequently used it a lot by doing the same technique since almost as if they have this inbox that you get on the same path with and you drop your little messages in there and then you for some reason they pick it up yeah yeah ...\nWe'll we'll do a little experiments of my groups by which one of those degrees the bell said to him it just might be a painting it might be a sculpture it's a non announced image to the group and people have to guess in the morning after the night of sending walk the walk the image that was being sent\nMight have beaten and it's interesting how that works and some people a very good at picking up and some people a better send us another ... this is just a focused example of something that we do automatic they connected with each other where ... where in into leaving field of interaction and it goes on in ... all the time\nRobert you've talked about synchronous and explain how that ties into our dreams\nWell I think it's like this way to make a dreaming once we understand that dreaming might be traveling we'd get out there we go beyond the cook will develop old reruns of standing in a consensual hallucinations and we get into a deep space we have encounters with people who live in a deeper space including the\nDeposit and our ancestors through synchronous today we often feel the forces and intelligence that lives on the other side of those cook in the walls of all three understanding come pushing all poking or ... to bring us a way to give us a message of some kind of\nThis is the thing about synchronous demeaning folk tunes that you gave us the woods in pregnancy because it's set up without trouble in Tokyo about coincidence I gave us a different would instant parents think we often feel there's a hidden happy feel uh getting awaiting cannot handshake or a pushback\nFrom something beyond our kittens something we cannot see so although the phenomena this cold isn't a causal phenomenon them and said since there's no obvious pattern of cause and effect we often feel there is causation that play you might even feel that very large forces are late\nForces the forces of human called the archetype so that people might have called the spirits of God's will the ancestors are in play\nSo I Am a great proponent and it's actually conditions and shaped every day of my life but paying attention to the unusual unexpected things that are going on in the world around you and seeing what the ... look like\nNot just one message you might get one message you needed at say stop or something like that\nBut you might notice that there's a path enough connection is you've got it through the day is sit in the sun comes up again and again a sudden symbol comes up again and again and you notice when that is happening as with a recurring dream hey slowdown pay attention or what you need to do with this what is the universe telling you that you need to rectify\nRobert since you've been doing this have we gotten the answer on why it works or how it works because we do agree that it does work what how yes\nWell it it the the laws attraction has been oversimplified and the states it by the by the new age but the laws attraction it's always in play the love attraction means that we attract overkill events or encounters according to the energy and the ideas we carry\nYou really have that kind of your hands and

designed to receive long range even ask them reception and\nMake those weak signals stronger the\nHigh quality audio from the CBC Radio too we can be adjusted as well you get great voice clarity even even for music it's really something so important to choose the radio that has the ability to bring in those stations crystal clear and you get that put the CBC Radio to eat from she crane\nI look up and I see this thing come over that looks like a cell phone upside down with one big light in the middle for on each corner and I realized that I'm In trouble all of a sudden and as soon as I turned to run away um I Know that I'm gonna get hit with either a mess or something\nLike ... or\nSomething like that and but I mean but I was a kid so none of this made any sense to me at all but now we have drones right so a ton of us drones are going to become a reality where they don't even after him placed soldiers or whatever\nI'm saying well let's get let's get Robert ... take on some of this rubber what do you think that many damn\nWell it's possible that you would dreaming of future developments in technology and in other ways that might manifest you sounds as if you haven't run into these situations in ordinary reality yet and hopefully you weren't\nBumped it's perfectly possible that you had long range pre cognition in dreams of situations that might develop in life it's also possible\nThat the dreams have a symbolic made not simply a liberal meeting but the symbolic me if I'm dreaming of of of the situation that seems very serious and talk and threatening going across the ... and seeing this maybe this EMT\nOkay maybe that's symbolic of something that lies ahead for me in life which is going to have the emotional for\nThe emotional pools or something like that maybe my dreams are actually coaching me preparing me for an emotional situation\nAre not all the situation which I Need to be ready I didn't know it but that comes to my mind the upside down cell phone you know I just want ... holding that image I realized that might be something larger more scary than a cell phone\nBut I sort of want to reach into that dream and grab that sells to let it be a cell phone and speak on it and see who's on the other end I mean this this is the way that I Am about treats I probably would you rather\nLiked the idea of the upside down cell phone yeah it's scary but if it's my dream my actually however many years that he has since the dream I sort of want to reach into the dream grabbed the cell phone or the ... to my ear and say who is there talk to me while you and see what I guess it might be that it's the kind of phony what you can talk to someone on the other side of death\nYou know dreams where often people are often talking to the dead on phones are receiving phone calls from them I sort of want to go nuts direction with that tree\nRobert wire dream sometimes convoluted in mired in a confusion in a terrible and things like that why isn't that just so obvious\nWell I think that actually the dream ... the dream sources of the many sources of premiums that tried to communicate as clearly as possible but but not necessarily not enough to follow all of this\nAh and also we need to remember the dreams are experiences that whatever report we we close to each other from a dream is only a report it's not the full experience so it might seem convoluted confusing or not ... but that might be because we've only brought back a few things from the dream and don't know how to put them together which is why\nI find the best way to understand the dream is to try to get your head back in\nA few things from the dream and don't know how to put them together which is why I find the best way to understand the dream is to try to get your head back inside to try to get back inside the tree take a look at what is really going on when you do that you pretty quickly determine whether this little little symbolic you can fill in some of the get when\nYou learn the technique of dream reentry of going back inside a dream I I and once we understand that I think one of the songs you were playing do something about living a whole life yeah\nPlay implicitly in your dreams I mean once we understand that we're having tremendous experiences\nAnd can live days or weeks in a in a dream in a few minutes to talk time they can begin to grasp that whatever we bring back to the dreams only partial and may be confused we might need to go beyond our memories of the tree and bring back more in order to understand what's going on\nOne is more prevalent Lucia dream free cognitive dreams just normal regular dreams what pops up the most\nWell a lot of people are dancing yet to understand how to come loosened treatments the idea of lists of dreaming has become very popular since that movie inception and the ideas talented you can make love to anyone in your dreams and you can be soup demanded set for said there's been a sort of adolescent quality to some of the\nThe the ... century listed dreaming is actually easier than most people make it for themselves but many trying memorized ways of ... that to really inside the dream because your hands if you can stick a finger through your um that kind of stuff\nAs I said earlier the easiest way to become looser treatments to start up loose that stay that way so I don't know how common listed breathing is amongst the population of the moment\nAt the moment I Do know that probably everybody is having ... dreams but only a few people are aware of that yet only a few people have woken up to it I think it's it's routine I think that we do in the night whether we note on not\nScout ahead of ourselves some aspect of consciousness checks up what lies ahead I think that's going on all the time\nI think many people have yet to wake up to the fact that they can do it and could use it\nSo regular dreams what regular dreams of people I mean the dream stand the whole spectrum they are big dreams a little dreams a little dreams that are rather routine processing of what went on the day before coming tree on how you said yourself and how fast you ate the night before then there are the big dreams which of the dreams which you feel that you have received a message\nOr she might kill yourself with President of the highest dose of wisdom oh you've gone travelling you know you've gone to a distant galaxy or different time period or a place with a dead or alive so the point is that\nOf these avenues of knowledge an adventure open to everyone all the time the only thing that prevents you from getting in on this\nIs is perhaps your reluctance until now to make time in your life to amend the more of what's going on in the night to write it down keep a journal that's basic practice\nKeep a journal writer don't give it a title natives your feelings around the experience to run a reality check asked whether this could happen in the future once you're willing to do some simple things like that you're on the way to becoming a more active treatment you had to find it came to power and ... and those sorts of ways\nTo go to Thomas in ... California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call Robert ... work that you are doing you know I wanted to tell me Robert I'm you know you talk about you know we get tired at night we close our eyes when we go to sleep\nWe have dreams and enough ... map totally travel ... maybe even mentally time travel but then\nTonight solver we open our eyes and is it possible you imply that is that we are stepping from one dream state to another that we are stepping in\nProm night to a white can dream during the day a dream and watch reality is maybe plastic malleable um ...\nWhere we can not just mentally travel mentally time travel but actually like the ... men and women around the world that cycling travel and physically time travel because they are aware that\nReality as white can dream as opposed to a night during I was wondering if you comment on that you seem to do that\nI ... I Love your raping statement Thomas yes I think we do step when we come out of the cream of the night into the dream of the day I think we do step from one stage unconditional treat me into another one I think the\nWaking life is also a dream in reality you might be more plastic and now they're both can we make allowance for we talked earlier about how your your your tensions the energies you carry the attitudes you carry good a shape you'll reality\nThe physical possibility of time travel or shape shifting et cetera is of course is is ... feet under debate among scholars and scientists and and their traditions of it in different so many lineages\nAs you imply whether time travel is a physical possibility either for certain kinds of primal sharman or with the technology of the future I don't know but I Do know I mean I don't know from my experience I don't think I physically stepped from one time into another though I felt very very much on the edge of it sometimes\nI don't know where the shape shifting in the way the Germans connect with animal spirits central it's\nPhysically impossible for both people today but I Do believe it probably was physically possible an earlier stage of human evolution when the human animal divide was not as absolute as is today but any way leaving aside those are areas which fascinating to think about and the stuff of good stories\nI'm absolutely certain that you are right when you say that to come back from a dream of the night in the day is to move from one stage\nOf dreaming to another actually I often feel Thomas divide step from what's simply step from one room into another from one landscape all from one will into another I have a sort of just so feeling okay I was there doing that that reality now I'm back in as the body and that that\nI get it out of bed I go out in the street and I try not to forget that we might have more opportunity as we go out in the street or out in the day to change things for the better\nMake healthy choices and to participate in the construction of reality that we sometimes falafel\nDreams is just so powerful Robert I think my gosh I'm\nDreaming of the way that we wake up this is one of my postal ... when I used to be my bumper sticker on my car when I had bumper stickers on my car I\nMade I made one that said wake up and dream because to me dreaming is not fundamentally about what happens during sleep I valued sleep creams highly including the ones you don't ... do not want that night show you exactly what you need to know that we can dream\nIn other ways and wake up to the deeper reality in other ways waking sometimes without dreams but like sleep workers doing with other people tell us to do trying to fit in with their expectations trying to to

trains that seemed to have\nA scene with moving parts it's clear that this moving parts\nAnd I would kind of compare this to say like the second half of the Titanic movie where\nA DiCaprio as are trying to find his way out of the ship that oil is moving parts and they still has that team they still wants to stay with us girlfriend and the movie uh yeah you know it still has also about the relationship so the idea of a dream showing moving parts\nAnd my second thing just as you're talking now [laughter] I was thinking of a I had played a lot of basketball and I never focused on jumping and I noticed\nA couple of times I block shots that word near the top of the black board so I had to be shopping high energy good jumping Joe yeah\nAnd this was correlated to going to the gym a lot more and I wasn't going to the gym so I could jump higher you know I was basically concerned with scarring a lot of points or getting a lot of assessed\nSo I Can't having the scream about shopping and I never really thought about shopping when I played a lot of ask a ball so what's\nIdea of a dream bringing up the aspects of something you did a lot\nYet didn't focus on while you were doing it and why would a drink to that it's OK maybe like a singer you know always son to a certain type of song or or in rock and springing up another type of a singing you know\nVery interesting ... I mean I'm thinking if I if I Am a former player and I'm not doing it the stage in my life but here I Am jumping at higher so I used to do in in my dream\nMaybe the dream is preparing me for jump jump in life of a different kind where is the next ... jump I might want to take in my life it might be a new form of activity\nMight be a new form of understanding where am I going to be a slam dunk in the field of activity in life so that we might be making an analogy between my ... my great prowess on on the basketball court\nWith these jumps at the junk that it lies ahead the the the moving parts and the Titanic analogy is interesting is not a lot to go on but if I if the moving parts they think of that you know emotional scene from the movie\nI might wonder again where in my life my being prepared by history to move on in some sense\nAnd I can't think about the Titanic without recalling the there was a great British research a psychic phenomena and the paranormal go W T stand here the famous to enlisted day who went down on the Titanic Twenty years before he went down on the Titanic\nHe wrote a story about the record the supposedly unsinkable line I called the majestic NO NAME of the captain of the vote in his story was the name of the captain on the Titanic\nSo they're from the history of the Titanic we have an account\nLong range pre cognition as embodied the story Rob and simply a dream of pulled I must add the stood up to death dictated or central dictated or a marketable account of life on the other side of death called the blue island so the Titanic association said also to pop moving in my mind that thank you for that\nYou know how do you explain things like Leonardo da Vinci came up with I mean he was a genius ... almost like a time travel I wouldn't do that in a dream state you think\nYou you feel that in relation to sit and kind of mind I mean she was often said that you can't explain Tesla the original Tesla except as a time travel you do feel that great minds are able to draw upon intelligence and understanding from more than the cover of reality they already know sends\nAble to reach two other mines the poet you ate the Irish poet relate to the theme of another my stories of mysterious realities\nSorry I had all in in\nA link or any [noise]\nRamble Miami mean\nFrom the Ninety seven point one the big talker weather center and always online ad big talk radio dot com I'm chief meteorologist Kevin Williams\nOvernight in fact staff clear calm cool down to thirty sunshine friday the high temperature fifty five in Sedona overnight we're we're down to forty of sunshine friday with a high temperature Seventy one and in Prescott forty for the overnight low on are clear skies sunshine friday with a high temperature near suffered\n[noise] ... ...

I'm a farmer I was trying to find him a ride on tractor that was a self powered and they can't find what I can find cars for a couple of hundred bucks and that are a self powered\nHis that and usually the first time I ever maybe because I'm looking for him but have they been around for awhile trainer they knew\nYeah well you know they've been around for a while but they ...\nIs that a huge the first time I ever maybe because I'm looking for him but if they've been around for awhile trainer they knew\nYeah well you know they've been around for a while but they improve every year and so has he has one that's the are the monster truck which might be fun for you and because it's the perfect\nSize for your grandson at the two one toy too because it's a wide on toy but also transitions really easily to a radio controlled vehicle just by pulling up the steering wheel and so it's a lot of fun to play with him so much play value\nAnd it goes forward and backwards\nAnd so there's so much fun to be had with that one and then there's another one more for the girls there's the Disney Princess ... horse and carriage\nWhich has a lot of play value to if she got storage for her toys and an area to put her drink and not one goes forward and backwards and then if you're looking for that classic bike huffy has an easy build bike that is\nComing out of the box that takes just a minute to put it together it's so easy and it's easy to grow with your child very easy to adjust and assemble and comes in all different styles aside this oh in terms of ride on toys and toys with whales I think these toys from hot they're going to be really hot this holiday season\nWhich horse power on that ... monster truck monster truck is\nTwelve or has a twelve volt battery and it's a point five miles per hour when you're riding on and then five miles per hour when you're using the radio controlled\nOr they don't make a big enough for your regime but you\nKnow they're going to bring you unfortunately you're granted I'm sure so\nI'm huffy it's interesting I haven't heard about the huffy ran for a long time I used to have a huffy by my daughter nice\nTo see or hear that there are ... but I didn't go anywhere but there as prominent as they are no tree\nOh they really are I mean they've been around for a hundred and twenty five years and ... is fun and ... and the liability and quality and what's great about these toys that I'm Talking about is that you have that big exciting box under the tree a child opens and it it takes just let it to get that toy\nUp and running for your child and all her with the battery operated\nToys they come with a charge of all battery so it's not like you're scrambling around looking for the right battery and replacing them when they run out you know plug that right back in and recharge and then your child can get right back into\nThe file or your sister because retrace on [laughter] you ... are you doing this where you're under the tree what together a decent ... or ... would you have to wait for the battery to charge him alone which extra more hours yeah right right and that's\nWhat I recommend for ... for parents is even if no hassle so finding a toy that you can get the kids up and running and playing really quickly and like you said not spending the whole night before assembling that toy are doing it while your child sitting there saying it's my toy ready yet I really like these for that ease of use\nWhat are the costs of some of these were price points do we have no you're going to make these more attractive trait\n... are the monster truck is Ninety nine dollars and because of the two in one toy it is of great value and that's something else that I like about how the two is because they are affordable but also so well built\nSo the ah the question and that's always the question of brand new for me you buy these things you put them together and they go on the driveway and in five minutes they're broken and you can't find the parts to fix them and it's just so\nThe thrill of opening the package and getting excited about using it quickly the luster has lost because the stuff is junk\nAt the ...

first of all it's just an inefficient process I I don't mean to criticize the culture of a of the Hispanic people but if you have ... if if if it's true what ... saying which is anyone who's named any foreign names\nAre all called ... is that true everyone who know every one is called Albert it's called every what everybody born\nIn El Paso that of Irish American\nDescent that same Albert author

I should be and you know please\nCome in and and whites plane this to us because we are just ... that's not a role here that we are just two white and understand things like that to to let ... let me let me in the outer submit it to me\nA better referring to himself has that show feels like a guy who wants to take advantage of the Hispanic community for votes I I Know that can't be true because but it's just because I'm too white to understand it\nI Can't quite get their cat clear that hurdle to understand why someone would do that and we will soon find out to see if we can find any any Roberts who are actually Robert\nSo it looks like we have a ah Joel Robert ... no doubt is Beto are calling from El Paso I'm Joe Robert yes it is it is it more preferred for us to refer to you is

O. E. first name Robert R O B e Archie and I'd already caught me and you know\nWhat is that when someone calls you up how do they refer to you\nAs well they don't say my middle ... most of that 'cause I don't give it out unless it's you know almost up but just you\nKnow in my life and if not better so Bob either I'm not job are you there [laughter]\nLet me ask you ... ... a B but why did you call national radio and lie because we know every morning in the area to Robert [laughter] better why would you lie now all those\nNames events and I I it it does it does depend on if they want to be called ... I mean\nIt's I don't know what it is but I Know and all those people\nAnd I've always called them either out there to go you know ... and the other one I didn't even know if it was a joke but [laughter] we are to me\nThat when do they do a lot of white guys call themselves better or do other people call them that are\nActually he's the first one that I Know a\nYoung guy [laughter] don't\nJudge Joe what is your background so do you what's your ethnic background\nOr Hispanic or you know but the Latin descent um a lot of people I get a lot but just because they say electric and American but I refute that are not getting it because I'm the shows that\nI Do have Mexican background but my surname which of course I'm not going to get out is a pretty state my spring for less than\n... ... ... so this is this is fascinating you are in in the Hispanic community\nYou have Robert in your name your not all ... and you know the people that you refer to in the Hispanic community with the names Robert Albert Gilbert in Umberto you refer to buy their actual makes ... ... ... ... this is an interesting piece of evidence we found a unicorn business you really only one or\nTwo we'll know there's one we should send that the men do so he doesn't make this mistake next time on CNN\nI don't want him to go down a road where he's making mistakes and saying things that blatantly aren't true on national television mhm that would be terrible for now we're just trying to help we're trying to healthier and also as Joe thank you Joe for calling in and and I would love to hear from more people\nIf you happen to be Robert Albert Gilbert or Umberto for having to live in a in a Hispanic community where you know or some one of these names that were always how you refer to it because that is the standard set up by ...\nAnd I'm curious to see if that if there are more unicorns out there and we've discovered something to work with on this is our one incredible we've already uncovered something that people have told us did not exist [laughter]\n[laughter] it's a miracle and all this hard research we put into this today uh-huh by giving up the phone number you know once or twice and shockingly we were able to uncover somebody so we'll see if there's more out there I don't know if there is I have a new he's\nThe only we've done a lot of digging so far so maybe it will produce more fruit I don't know a Richard in Texas you're on the Glenn Beck program Hi\nHey guys my name is Richard I'm Out here in El Paso okay uh the first thing I like to say that there's really not that many Latino is named Francis\n[laughter] that's\nMy first point of your second point that you were mentioning I Would say that Ninety five percent of the people that are named in the names that you mentioned to go buy it at all\nMhm that's a high percentage I mean that's one of them is a lot\nAnd I am the no and I am an American citizen\nAll right well thank you very much like\nThat's what we're that's what happens here in our community\nOkay so you do in El Paso you do know a lot of guys go a lot of white guys that go by Beto\nNo\nNo [laughter] okay so the guy we're talking about here the Ninety five zero clothing goes\nRight [laughter] okay so I I 'cause this is an interesting distinction you're saying in the Hispanic community people of Hispanic descent with some of these names are like that show but the people who are white yeah Robert for instance do not go by Beto no\nOkay that makes it okay what are they going to help veterans of that much not I don't think it's the same thing for for that I Can't look but there's a couple of points out that we're going to if you don't always when you're ... your ...\nThat's how that that much not I don't think it's the same thing for for that I Can't look there's a couple of points out there we're going to if you always when you're ... you're searching for horses you're going to find a couple with horns on their head that one of the things some of them are going to be able to fly it part of the it's just part of the experience when you were looking to find a horse\nHey look at that one it's got it happens to be rainbow colored in his flying through this guy everyone has do and you say huh\nHow about that I'm just here I just concerned yeah because you know look CNN is the place where they're gonna they're gonna dig deep\nAnd get the facts out check this guy he's going to get a massive fact check at some point today because apparently we're hearing from El Paso that people that are white named Robert for instance are not typically called ... business I mean\nAnd we don't do it at all that if you have Hispanic background and your name is Robert ... that you're called Beto and that doesn't I I'm not surprised by that at all what what surprised me as if a lot of Roberts who were just white guys that usually go by Bob in this culture ...\nAre are going by Beto now can you know one interesting thing we could do with Robert France has a ... 'cause you could call them Bob Frank over to right we can go with\nBob Frank O'Rourke you could yes you could Bob Franklin work as it is not it doesn't connect and deeply to the Hispanic community I wouldn't say Bob Frank [laughter] ah but I'm sure he ... that had nothing to do with his consideration by\nPutting federal knows the science that we of course know that he was calling himself Bob on television when he was in a band\nYeah and that band performed on television in El Paso ... on their morning show and he brought his incredible guitar style aims to the show\nAnd it was getting late in the show and the host of the show was concerned that they got to start playing 'cause the show was about [noise]\nWhat do you call the near\nAre going to be over before [noise]\nSo he's talking to a better way believe at that time [noise] and then you hear the guitar styling the Bedouin self\nCredibly talented and go out and listen to this guy is [noise] it's good\nReally heavy but yeah this is actually better playing guitar [noise]\nAnd then they kick it into gear man\nOn the guitar styling [noise]\nOf federal friends is from Bob Bob Franco roar\nWow that is talented but he's called Bob ...\n\n[laughter] dad's embarrassing or just a one giant and ... it is a campaign yeah they I mean the fact that this\nGuy's caught on with the left it I mean they'll man of they want to run for president in twenty twenty he's raised more money than any Senate candidate in history for a quarter that's how much they love this guy he raised more in this quarter than Brock Obama did back in two thousand eight\nThat's incredible that amazing because why he made a speech about the NFL where he said it was okay to Neal because they are I guess that there isn't more American than that I can I can think of a lot more American than that a lot I I I don't uh I don't think I understand it but\nMaybe we'll get more evidence from El Paso and this will show us that there's only two there's only two people who would possibly disagree with the story from Beto O'Rourke in these communities I'm Glad we've heard from a couple a because it proves that unicorns do exist but we'll we'll figure it

process\nThe presumption of innocence the Republican for the first time in their life that something right they handled it with the serious this the topic deserves they were thorough they did it right

me that's that's just a an attack on my community and it's a it's a statement as to what what she thinks about all of us and\nUh and she's never pay taxes in our local community it's unbelievable\nNo

they are they are [laughter] and that's good and uh I always appreciate all the time you do yeah and folks it's not just during election time you know we're having so many candidates come through senator Allen [noise]\nBut um you take the time when you're in office I mean you and I've had many conversations whether I go down to the capital or your calling in er during session or to fill folks and so I I really appreciate that because\nI have a saying if if you can't if you don't hear from them now you're definitely will hear from them later especially right or go to DC\nWell it's a challenge because we have such a large district but I I Do love being able to inform my constituents about what is happening because so much misinformation out there so I'd rather be able to explain hey this is what this bill really means are this is what we're doing and so I Try really hard to do that\nNow I have spent so much time talking about\nUm the billionaire out to California is dire who obviously has political ambitions and you know this this isn't about proposition one twenty seven or anything like that this was about a guy\nA building a ground game and he's chosen Arizona's one of his prime targets and prop one twenty seven is the initiative you know I've talked about this before prop Twenty one twenty seven would have Arizona getting\nA fifty percent of its energy from renewable resources which basically means solar I just towards ... nuclear power plant Senator Alan and it was absolutely amazing the amount of energy we get out of that and what one twenty seven would do\nUm is it ... it would shut it down eventually your thoughts real quick on one twenty seven then we're going to get into ...\nWell of course and we're always concerned about education dollars and the power very a plant\nIt pays sixty million dollars a year and how would we make that up we would have to go to property tax on commercial as well as private and so we need to be thinking about the long term consequences of such a horrible proposition passing\nSo this guy's dire he he wants to get this one twenty seven passed in Arizona but I I don't know what happened I assume there's probably some kind of this is my guest there's some kind of internal polling numbers saying it's not doing well for don't assume that folks do go out and vote no on this thing\nSo he decided let's or that group decided I should say\nThey decided to spend um a bunch of money against candidates attorney general mark Vernor Vinge is one of them I'm trying to get him back on the show this week\nAnd um they're they're dumping money three point six million opposing him it's a pretty short list of politicians in Arizona He's opposing now and they're shifting that money from one twenty seven candidates you are one of them wanted you to do to deserve this this honor it is an honor because\nOver liberal a organization coming against ya\nIt really is and I I think it's because number one\nI Am the education chair of the Senate and education at such a big issue for them and number two is because I always told people would I think I stand up by speak out against injustice that I see\nAnd so ah he's you know I'm One of the ones targeted and they think if they can flip my seat they might be able to flip the Senate\nWhich should be a terrible disaster for our state\nThe state Senate you're talking to safe\nThan it oh yeah how about ... is the state Senate we have now Seventeen Republicans and\nOut of thirty senators takes sixteen to have a majority and to be able to get anything passed out of the Senate so you can see we have a very close majority in the Senate and so their their goal is to try to flip the state blue and they're targeting the Senate and they're targeting my seat because of\nThat diversity within my\nA district of that and the numbers of Republican independents and Democrats how much money they're spending hundreds of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars and\nUh I've never had TV ads ran against me because they're so expensive and you know being in rural Arizona TV's kind of not a good place to put your dollars but they are putting money in ... so that that is hundreds of thousands of dollars and I'm ... and\nI Am I concerned of course I Am but I also have a lot of faith in my district and in the base and the people who know had known me all these years and uh no my voting record I have been recognized by many conservative organizations all these years uh always high every year\nAnd I'm so I'm consistent and people know that and I think that I Will ... will retain my seat I really do\nOr folks are talking with US Senator Silvio and she's the chairwoman of the Arizona ... the Senate education committee and that's part of the reason why you think you're being targeted have slowly by this let's call it what it is outside money\nUm and it was what is the problem okay you know we talked a lot during last session about all the money that went into education\nThere was a big chunk of money to teachers around the states got a pretty significant raise\n... percent raise over three years yeah but then they got like ten percent this year alone I live here what's what's the issue here are they mad over um the invest in education um initiative that got dumped off the ballot the Supreme Court what what's the problem\nThey're very mad and as you know there's been\nA negative anti science around my district saying that I cut education as they tried to use a ... particular number for each district where the sinus located saying I cut millions of dollars from that school circus them and their customizing at and and that's just it it's just\nPlain downright wrong and I think that people are recognizing the socialist\nCalifornia style past the tactics are not going to play over here in Arizona\nFor instance jak this absolute truth I can show you\nThat the money starting in two thousand and eight which is always the baseline we go back to because that was right before the recession so then we had the recession three billion dollar deficit and of course at that time education K. through twelve is cut three percent everybody else study ten to Fifteen Percent cut\nA it was a terrible time for our state sense than we have been re story education dollars and I can show you now today we are one point three billion dollars ahead of where we were in two thousand and eight\nAnd and that is including our teachers race and our economy is growing and thriving and so it's so important that we don't allow these California socialist slight principles to to blanket our state and destroyed the progress we have made\nAnd out of their work and they're spending that we get these tax dollars and then we have to determine where do we put them we we don't just have education to find which is fifty percent of our general fund budget but we have others until it becomes a big battle\nWell what they're angry about is they want us to get more money from the people there they're angry that we won't pass new taxes and go back\nTo the people at instead our philosophy my philosophy is listen this is what the people of than\nIs we have to create a budget out of that and we have to be responsible\nAnd we should be grateful that gets me upset nobody it's great pull about all these billions of dollars that the taxpayers give us you never get a thank you letter never get a chance\n[laughter] I haven't had one teacher thank the legislature for that race\nAt all because you know I talked about that when it was how are you still haven't gotten to know\nI Am but really I Want him to turn around and thanked the small business person in their community because that's really where the money comes from is from the citizens but still there's no gratitude and I think that's terrible\nUh we as individuals families you and I we have to live on a budget\nWe can't just go out we all we can rack up our credit but then there's the ... you know there was a ... day same with the states so they're mad we won't put you know raise taxes\nAnd that's where it comes from and it's a different in a philosophy a socialist kind of philosophy versus a free market philosophy and\nAnd that's the battle that's going on in our state is a socialist kind of thinking that that if we need more money just go get it and the people and um and hey let's go after the rich people I just saw an article where\nAre the majority of taxes are paid by three percent of the ... the rich people are paying the bills\nAnd so yes it's going to be an issue again and we're going to have of our revenues are doing wonderful we're going to have a surplus this next year and there's going to be a battle where we put it and I know that educational get a lot of those dollars\nThat well we'll see what happens and yeah I I've seen this on local levels to Senator Alan words\nUm they almost look at that money that they don't tax as we're not collecting everything we should you know what I'm saying like it's their money to have\nWhere if it's still in my pocket it's my money even if you take it as so my money that you just took but sometimes you just like just you could you ask me for pay the taxes of before you go crazy spending it or a folk senator Sylvia ... I guess I I\nGot to ask you about a big issue that ah let me set this up for you because I've been talking with lots of guess about this um and you being me share a woman of the Senate education committee I I thought this was right up your alley and I've talked about it with Governor do see with other representatives\nAnd it has to do with the growth of universities in general but northern Arizona university NYU um for a long time there's kind of a segment of the population is I case getting a little bit and this was maybe winners Fifteen thousand students now there's Twenty one twenty two twenty three thousand students\nBut the Arizona board of regents and the president of the universe they have a target of about thirty three thousand now you know flags stuff you know these communities this is a smaller city this is Seventy thousand people and you start thinking about that plus thirty three thousand\nThey're starting to interface on the main drag of the city which is Milton avenue very busy and they're buying up Thirteen million dollars worth of property\nTo to blow the buildings down and build stuff new used to be the universe is kind of back they're hidden away now it's kind of getting creeping up into the core of the time so you got a lot of folks have lived here for many years generations who are looking at announcing\nHalf the popular are we a city where the university or university when city anymore does does it get to a point where they try to grow too much and ... are you hearing concerns you yourself and and I guess I'm here to kind of be that conduit and say there are concerns\nYeah well thank you personally if I'm On a tell you I think any use wonderful university and and there's more in state tuition students coming to any you than any of our other universities\nOr I mean I I'm a good a big fan of any you but without being sad one problem we have in the city is your land block\nJust you are surrounded by federal land and you can't grow you can't move out ... and that's one problem so that that so if the college wants to grow the university wants to grow yeah it has a problem can't move out it's going to have to move in\nAnd uh I think that I can see both sides of that is going to create some problems and um and whether this city can really handle a University of that size is a really good question that you here locally I've got a determined and um and I think the universities so seriously look at that\nAnd the other thing I think a little bit sad about the money to grow that big is I think there's an advantage to coming to a small university yeah I think you get more attention more help\n'em [noise] and I I think that's an advantage to something they could sell you know trying yeah\nI see the billboards and Phoenix that come up to the mountains come to this quaint university but um there's an expression up here that you ... don't Phoenix flag\nAnd I never really bought much inside but I don't I don't need an ASU in my backyard or you have and my back yard um let me let me do back your ... because the governor said kind of the same thing and others have said the same thing it's it's something locally we have to decide\nBut it's I got to be honest with you I have sent many many requests for president Rita trying to come on this program\nAnd she hasn't and I'd love her to come on we'd have a great conversation um the board of regents decide this stuff I keep hearing I kind of keep your nose is decision locally but there's not a lot of local talk and input and and uh they're they're not seeking a lot of that\nOut they may have a few public meetings but people are saying and I'm kind of that conduit that saying people are concerned and they they want to talk about these growth targets but then I don't hear from the people that have the power to change it the board of regents the president of the university and so forth\nUm so how do we ... I'm putting that out their worst I I Can't speak for everybody but I can speak to tons of listeners um\nOr um so how do we ... I'm putting out their worst I I Can't speak for everybody but I can speak to tons of listeners um who are saying we want to talk about this but then we're not hearing back from them so I put that in your ear okay I Am just so you're aware of it just 'cause I did with the governor out 'cause it's a huge concern up here\nWell I'm Glad to know about this issue and and for you to bring it to my attention\nEducation's huge or any use a great asset to the community but there are just those concerns that we want to\nAddress going forward in a growing community like Flagstaff is I mean frankly I think you you've been you've done well with your economy here I Wish we could move some of that over ... county we would take it\nBut I think there's going to have to you're right there's got to be a balance between that growth within the university especially since you are land block and you don't have a much land available at so I think those are legitimate concerns\nOr is it all and you got a few weeks ago\nA couple of weeks ago or manage this man is coming up fast let's assume you get back down there um first of all I ask us of a lot of candidates something you're really proud of that you've done or in the past and the Senate or an inch since you've been done\nWell actually it it kind of goes to education I ran last two years Eighteen bills that were able to I was able to get through and signed by the governor I'd had a meeting with my\nDistrict superintendents and I took some things that they were wanting changed and I was able to get him changed and and that made me it it I see my goal is\nTo do what's best for kids that's number one what is best for kids next to supporting parents and their decisions uh education decisions for their children that choice and third supporting teacher's doing everything I can to support our teachers and so I pass bills to support our teachers\nI pat I created a new a scholarship program for continuing education for teachers at ... in certain areas we need physics teachers and this would allow them to go back if they were a math teacher and get their a\nContinuing education so that could be a physics teacher I'm very proud of that I I worked with\nA gentleman uh Mike and he was\nA we just had a great he was a physics teacher and he came and he said here's this problem Senator Alan and we went to work and we fixed it and a teacher certification reciprocity between other state I could go on and on I Wish I had time to go through these Eighteen bills I'm proud\nOf them yeah they did make education better and they they supported all the things I just said children parents and teachers and I had done a I've worked really hard in that area the other one I'm proud of is helping you have a pi county with their reach out program\nI have a soft spot for the mentally ill citizens in our in our state and we have neglected them as I said if we can't climbed out of this recession there's many things we we have not been able to find\nAnd now we need to start looking at other issues besides the education and ... we have a lot of work to do in this state and as this and commie improves it allows you to do more work and and I'm excited to get back down or I just talked\nTo share a mash or about\nA this reach out program which he's very proud of and how we can extend it in and help all the different county jails have this program\nAs your measure of your bike\nOn national yeah ... yes he has to measure has which I'm very proud of that so uh uh just to tell you about some endorsements I've endorsed by congressman go suck ... congressman or let's go\nOut and I of many of my fellow senators and and I got supervisors and I've got citizens\nI I'm very very I'm honored and humbled by the support that I have and those who have supported me over these years and Jeff I Want them to know I I'm not broken my trust with them and I hope that they will send me back because uh this'll be my last time to go back\nI Want to finish off the things I Want to do for education and um the next step is talking about\nIn Sedona we're sky for any parts of cottage like below fifty Seventy three tomorrow afternoon shark and

a little bit and get folks voting for her ah with President Trump in town for a mix Sally rally\nAnd that's happening tonight and I'm going to try to get down there I Do have tickets are probably duck outta here a little early instilled try to make it um to the Trump rally folks welcome hope you all have in a great day happy to be here with you today\nI Do want to hear from you get your comments in early here and uh also by email anytime talk with Jeff at iCloud dot com or phone number eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one I I don't know if any more tickets are available I had tried to get my salary on this week to\nGive you folks them tickets but we were not able to connect um but if you've never been to a Trump rally it is worse going over the last one I went to was in Phoenix and uh it was last year and I actually we broadcast it some of it um you know the protesters and there's always protesters that ended in tear\nGas and hopefully that's not the case tonight and I the story the biggest thing I remember when I went to the last Trump rally or was how\nPacked it was how motivated the crowd was and then coming out of the rally though I remember these antifa like people and they're like they're in black football helmet says I come out with my wife I'm ... and it ended in ... fortunately I wasn't in it um but this is how these things\nThese folks come out to protest these things I'll never forget that the black football how much\nAre but anyway Trump will be there\nAnd what you'll see is a a push to get much Sally um votes obviously to try to maintain that slim majority in the U.S Senate\nUm so we'll see how all that goes I I Do have a report here this one's interesting just from Wall Street Journal or in a hopefully Trump will talk about this tonight but Trump\nIs seeking five percent budget cuts from from cabinet agencies\nSo he's asking his cabinet folks to find five percent of cuts next year targeting government spending after an official tally showed Republicans tax cuts drove the federal budget deficit to its widest level and six years he's saying quote get rid of the fat get rid of the waste\nA it'll have a huge impact and I agree absolutely she should give them that challenge find the five percent introductions or\nYou know I did this locally I go back to my ... years it's there the money's there I proposed that we cut one percent find one percent of cuts in the budget\nI remember that the mayor of Flagstaff current mayor coral Evans she was a council member at the time oh this is horrible you're you're trying to cut people's jobs and you know there's nothing to cut works were barebones there is nothing to cut well what is\nWhat happened what happened they came back\nWith one percent this is one percent we're talking about folks that I wanted the city to cut in their budget\nThey came back with one percent of cuts it was as simple as rebuilding their insurance policy like the liability policy it was that simple one item imagine if they dug deep and how much government could cut how much fat as Trump says get rid of the fat\nGet rid of the waste 'cause it's there when the politicians say it isn't there\nYou know it's their trust me any anyway ... end of my story they found the money and I tried to get a totally caught but then they wound up by just re allocating it ended up budget elsewhere uh that's what they often do but if you could surely getting their cut it like President Trump wants to\nGood it needs to happen in the country can't go on with the levels of debt and spending that we have a under Democrats and Republicans can't happen so hopefully President Trump well dressed that tonight at the rally in Mesa a but what's interesting is some numbers have come out and\nThis raises a nail biter folks and our good friend at data orbital dot com George K less he joined us and he has new information new survey I've been waiting for the survey that come out uh George what do you see in\nOur new polling and we have to uh just to kind of make everything a clear for the list\nIn for the survey that come out uh George what do you see in\nOur new polling and we have to uh just to kind of make everything a clear for the list if you have to what we call turnout scenario so there's a scenario where you know the Democratic surge which I don't believe we're on pace for but there's a democratic surge scenario\nThat has what we call the Republican about advantage at five percent and then there's a a more of an average case scenario that has the Republican about advantage at nine percent which is there's ... percent more Republican than Democrat to show up and vote and in the five percent democratic search scenario we\nHave congresswoman ... up by eight percent against harm someone ... collie and then in the Republican I'm sort of average surge scenario we have some sort of still up by five percent so essentially in both scenarios we still have a congresswoman cinema up or just outside of the margin of error on a congresswoman Martha\nMcSally wild so the surge narrow up more obviously are within the margin of error on the just kind of normal election days you know traditional turnout type thing yeah\nYeah exactly and ... and we have about seven percent of people that are undecided over on the survey and saw this to be expected to shrink now there's two interesting things a little note with these numbers\nUm that that I think is critical for uh for the listeners should know that there are more Republicans that are undecided than Democrats very few Democrats are undecided so essentially that the cake is based on a within among the Democratic side\nOr so there's already a lot of people that have voted so that's why I find George Caleb ... poll or you're just joining us data George Caleb data orbital dot com was with us and the last segment\nAnd he has a new poll that out you can get it at data orbital dot com um and it's showing cinema still up and he took the poll on the ... what he called the tail end of all that stuff that came out over the last week or ten days\nAs we see and that's very close that have signed a laboratory of democracy and then my faith Arizona is clearly the\nYears he was\nLike he didn't\nTalk to you about some of the things that I think that you can continue to doctors taste somebody coming Harris\nAnd this was find things in our state serving made his money but I think the whole crazy\nSo I think that um she survived that onslaught now now we'll see there'll be more polling and the ultimate palsy only pulled on matters is the one that happens November sixth and we've seen polls that have failed dramatically in the past\nAh but I guess I continue to ask what's going on here which cinema despite all of that you'd think she'd be in a more Republican leaning states she'd be behind by twenty points\nI and I think that congresswoman Martha McSally is kind of feeling the same way she's I sensed frustration when she was on the program just last week here's a just a short clip of what she had to say\nThat I was in Saudi Arabia on nine eleven I live in the Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia we went immediately into a lock down and then we very quickly ramped up to plan and execute the campaign in Afghanistan and at that\nTime literally the day after nine eleven cinema is protesting using military force against her if she wanted to bring them into the courts instead and then later on she's leading protests and the two two and handing out the fire saying we the U.S troops are the terrorists\nYou know she's protesting a President Bush are setting up the department of homeland security she's protesting against support for Israel's\nProtesting Lieberman for working with Republicans\nTo get on the radio saying come and our kids come socialist come communist all come to our protest\nAnd said it was okay she was okay with Americans joining the Arab on this extreme stuff\nIt just broke in the media yesterday and she was inviting a lawyer who went to jail for basically you know supporting the blind Sheikh who was responsible for the world Trade Center bombing and she was inviting her you know to the issue campus\nAfter she had been indicted and and making excuses for her you can't make this stuff out that she's actually in a dead heat with me to be Arizona twelve senator [laughter] unbelievable and disqualifying on so many levels\nSo right there you can hear it you can hear the frustration in a Congress in ... ah interview she did with me last week\nAnd uh she's ... I guess can't understand why and I guess I ask you why why in a state that's leaning Republican that independence a lotta times will break Republican at least enough for them to get these folks elected on state wide basis\nWhy are they and if you maybe you're one of the maybe you're one of those independent or Republicans why are they breaking for cinema\nAnd we'll see if the Trump rally tonight or does anything to change that\nUm but yeah the the the numbers are showing\nA that cinema that is breaking for cinema and I have a couple of ideas you know first of all let me be clear I'm voting for congresswoman Martha McSally I'm supporting congresswoman Martha McSally\nI talked to a lot of independents and Republicans who are still unsure just like George Kendall is Paul is indicating and he was saying something like twenty percent of independents are still breaking for cinema\nLooking ... who are still unsure just like George Kendall is Paul is indicating and he was saying something like twenty percent of independents are still breaking for cinema\nUm what is it\nWhat is it I mean obviously these videos aren't working they might be a ... eroding cinemas lead just a tiny bit but it's not showing the impact that I thought it was going to have a and I think they're surprised as well\nAnd one factor that I've noticed is a lot of people I'll talk to independents and Republicans they don't really know this stuff they're not that deep into the they're not hearing it\nAnd another factor another factor\nRegarding cinema that I hear a lot of people saying and I think it's a pretty decent observation is the likeability factor\nThey hear cinema they see her at rallies or they see her commercials and for some reason there like a you know what maybe I disagree with her and some issues but I like her speaking of voting um this is from the Arizona daily sun Coconino county voter registration reaches\nAll time high blue wave in Coconino county in Coconino county is traditionally a much more Democrat and Republican\nHere's here's from the paper the total number of registered voters in Coconino county for the upcoming November ... election reached a record high of eighty three thousand two hundred and thirty nine registering according to the Coconino county a press release this or passes the county's previous record of eighty one thousand\nFour hundred and sixty one registered voters set up to two thousand six team general election the political party breakdown of registered voters in ... in the county is Democrats forty\nPercent almost forty one percent\nTwenty five percent and independence thirty two percent so is there a blue wave in Coconino county is a blue Saddam\n[noise]\nBut Arizona's still leans Republican you have a pi counties heavily Republican Napa County I'm so we'll see what happens get out there and vote I mean you get out there and vote if you if you know\nYou you hassle November six than anything can happen but we're going to have a close Senate race we're gonna have a close CD one race was Wendy Rogers and Tom O'Halleran yeah that is going to be close as well we'll get Wendy Rogers back in here I hopefully next week\nI'm ... and see what's going on with her campaign are folks who was a here's what I'm going to do I'm I'm taking off I got the a Trump rally are going to try to get to on time is still got time to get down there and then on Monday I have a bunch of close for you on that but when we come back\nI worked really hard on this segment that we played Monday and a three o'clock hour

explaining all of this while I'm up there but you know what I'm I'm sweating now you're not supposed to touch your face you faces exposed and ... and of course as soon as you put all your on your your your ... or something but you can't touch your face so we're on this cat ... walk there explaining all this I'm just like zoning out I'm looking at this ...\nYou know I'm looking down at the reactor and these guys are working down there and I'm looking at all of these pipes and wires it's just an engineering marvel and I'm trying to think about who the heck even thought of this stuff\nI'd so they're trying to explain they're doing a good job but we were just all like sweat and then just it's beyond our comprehension to see how this thing works so anyway we spent some time inside the the ah containment area looking at the reactor normally this would be where you'd look down\nWhere the rods are or where the water is and there's usually a blue glow and they control the amount of a heat up by lowering and raising those rods\nAnd that creates the steam and turns the turbine we'll get back to that here and just a second\nBut after we're outside so we walk back through that big steel door\nWe had out of the containment building\nAnd then this is interesting now you have to um now I don't want to use the word ... robe and it wasn't that you have to take off before you exit that radiation area you have to take off all the gear that we spend a bunch time putting on earlier and there's a bunch of garbage cans lined up and you basically go through a whole process\nOf removing the stuff first you remove your boots and you throw 'em in with your fingertips into the garbage cans they apparently take this and they destroy it all they don't you read is that\nThey destroyed awesome company does it so you go through this line and each time there's a pad\nAnd it has like feed on it seems like an airport and you have to kinda hopscotch to the next\nSection in and take off more layers and ultimately you get to the front of my ... and we didn't we didn't strip down to make it or anything they weren't ... describing this town that you get back to your original clothes and you get it all off\nAnd then you get to the front and there's there was a girl there and you step over the line basically and\nShe scan she uses a Geiger counter to check your hands and your feet mixtures\nIn any uh any ... radiation radioactive particles I don't I don't know if she's in but I'm looking at the meter and the thing spike and it's going up to like popping up like a hundred and I'm like ... you know this isn't good\nI'm going to be in some kind of you know radiation quarantine issues like she laughs at me she's like no this is you get more radiation exposure in Flagstaff at that high altitude so I was cleared we moved on\nBut it's not over than you have another security check a there's a machine that's like it's like a mold over human you know what I'm saying and you have to stand in it for ... and it detects if there's any radiation on you then you flip around\nIt ... the the other side of you then before you can exit that area you leave that machine there's another machine it looks like a kind of like you know metal detector\nAnd you're sitting there for like ten seconds on his detecting if there's any radiation you turn around and does it again and anyway it cleared me and then finally\nWe go back to our our radiation specialist who did an awesome job and we had them are radiation December that that that device that detects your exposure and they check it so uh another check there and um mine red zero zero exposure within um within the containment building\nSo it all wet well it was absolutely amazing we continue to tour and the whole point of this\nIs to generate electricity so they took us into the generating room [noise] this is where the steam goes in big long pipe basically and it turns the wheel that creates the electricity I don't know how to do it but that's that's how they you know turn the wheel degrade the electricity this thing is like the size of my house\nAnd he's explaining to me I'm Still not sure how the electricity is created\nFrom the radiation from the steam from the other room that where you're just stand up to this point so so he kinda explains it to me\nFrom Iraq\n\nYou may I ask yourself where's all the water come from because if you're familiar with the location of the Palo Verde nuclear power plant west it's out in the middle of the desert pass the buck I there's no water there\nI always just assume that the um uh you know the canals the Colorado River water was just being used and in a way I guess it is but it's indirect the water's actually coming from a different source\nOr here's a Richard and and Don ... explain it as far as where the water's coming from and this is pretty unique in the tire a nation as far as water supply\nWater\nWater went\n\nIf you think about it most nuclear power plant you see they're like on the ocean or on a river or buy a big like a big source of water or this is unique they're using the reclaimed water out of the Phoenix area\nAnd folks in ... except for very familiar with this I mean they have reclaimed water that's being used up at the Arizona snowball to make snow or so they're using this class a reclaimed water or two and then they filtered even more uh for the power plant and then I I don't know if you could hear it because you know we're\nLast a reclaimed water or two and then they filtered even more uh for the power plant and then I I don't know if you could hear because you know we're in this this machinery such varied a lot of background noise\nBut they are recycle it it gets recycled many times and they have to filter it there and so much more so amazing technology just in that they have to run a filtration plant\nSo anyway the last part of the toward the one that really interested me or the whole thing and trust me but what happens in a lot of people think about this and are concerned with it\nWhat happens with the waste so the uranium does get used and there is a waste a product and there's a pad that they drove us to where there's a bunch of steel containers where they store the waste a V. chip nuclear officer ... explains that what do you do after the\nFuel is used I guess so you've got these college they're they're used up what comes out so you you've got this little eraser sized pellet for example ... after the Eighteen months you use up the fuel what's ... what's that look like and what happens to so each one of our fuel assemblies\nA is about twelve feet long\nAnd has about a hundred and twenty pins in it uh that that are stacked with with those lunar ... raised her size ... so we checked each one of those fuel symbolism we put it in the spent fuel pool and we stored there five to ten years and then we take it from the spent fuel pool and we put it in the stainless steel canister\nOr we we've vacuum drag actually well the lid on that stings Steele canister after we put it in and then we vacuum drug take all the moisture out of it and give it to a perfect vacuum ... wasn't inert gas\nWell to a ... a little small two inch plug on onto it and then we put that stainless steel canister into a concrete over pack and then we put it out on on the pad waiting to go to Yucca Mountain or to go reprocess were whichever we decided to do as a country\nAnd Yucca Mountain obviously is the facility in Nevada as hum it that is operational and they're they're storing the idea there was a centralized ... it's not operational ... the idea was to get a centralized location because you have all these facilities around the nation of what's going on there\nOr you know one that is just never been approved a we've done all the build a Nevada has never really wanted that Senator Harry Reid was was opposed the and then from the beginning uh give him credit for that and so uh it's just never taken the\n... just never gotten approved by the Nuclear Regulatory commission\nTo allow those customers a fuel cell is so now you store it yourself and to or not necessarily [noise]\nI'll tell you what folks either newfound respect for what it takes to keep that electricity on so that you can go home and flick that light switch on\nIt's incredible the amount of people behind this and that nuclear power plant is a huge part of this I Am a resounding no no on proposition one twenty seven we don't need a California billionaire a coming over to Arizona and screwing up\nOur energy policy and making rate's higher here in Arizona\nFolks that entire interview with the chief nuclear officer Bobby minutes is up at talk with Jeff doc I'm it goes on for he gets so much detail go check it out entire interview out that talk with Jeff dot com go check it out well worth less than five\n\n[noise] when Dan Deasy ran for governor", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018",
