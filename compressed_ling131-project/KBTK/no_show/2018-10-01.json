A. W. land air and water and it's jam packed with odd spooky raised the hair on the back of your neck true life stories of people who simply vanished to dip into thin air\nThe circumstances in each of these cases are very specific to a pattern that was discovered by Dave and up by now\nHe's looked at thousands of these disappearances and some patterns have emerged on land around ... water and as we will hear tonight in the air as well so this evening we will hear the latest including a few cases that are ongoing at this moment fresh mysteries that maybe you can help solve\nA David joins me in just a few minutes and we will jump right into it but those who do not familiar with the mystery we'll start with a refresher on the characteristics that make these particular cases stand out from a standard case of somebody who just gets lost in the woods\nAbout new evidence in cases he uncovered and then the last hour tonight I'm not sure what we're going to do I I think I'd like to hear from listeners your ideas about what's going on here why some people are seemingly taken by whom\nAnd whether we will ever be able to resolve this so put your thinking caps on and be ready to jump into the discussion in our for also tried to save some time for you to interact with Dave as well in our three\nOne news note here in Las Vegas we're on the eve of a somber remembrance one year ago October first but worst mass murder incident in American history unfold fifty eight people were gunned down that an outdoor concert on the strip hundreds were wounded or injured\nKind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered him didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't\nAnd they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started\nAnd I filed a series of the freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal lead train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training or smart people they understand what should be done and I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any list and they don't have any listened missing people in their parks and jurisdictions\nAnd uh we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues so we've refiled and they came back into tourney called this time it's like why do you want this information\nExplain to him I said hey you can't ask that as a determining factor in for you and they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said wow research and then it came back and he said well you don't have any of us are missing people\nI said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol and you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are to the detectives\nSo somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or acumen to list at headquarters to understand what's happening and it's only politically correct if somebody calls and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it and said no we don't have any less so\nYears ago somebody said well if they if you are just file a request and see how many rolls of toilet paper it Yosemite National park I bet they have that inventory list [laughter] and of course they would but as it happened\nThey came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my author status\nAs an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books aren't enough libraries to qualify Lucian of such qualifiers just some arbitrary thing they said\nAnd then I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together the lists I Want to list from Yosemite and I want to was from the national Park Service and they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire\nSystem and I can't\nTell you how many people since I first said that years ago have tried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting the list from their entire system because they still say they don't have it and I've done interviews on other stations were\nPosts have said Dave I'll say it right now we will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets and we'll put a clip boards at every park and every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating the list\nAnd they can hire an intern during the summer there can screen the monthly reports that come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now\nOf course they they wouldn't even respond and wouldn't even acknowledge it but as you've stated in many others after you nobody believes they say that the list exists\nWell a ... if they're going to charge one point four million more than a list exist um you know it's it's pretty clear they don't want to cooperate on this that they don't want to pay more attention to be drawn to it and uh\nThe night we're going to explore maybe some of the reasons behind it up for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the ... points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books and the kinds of things that you look for\nSome people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people you're not going to get a lot when you read a thousand certain things started jumping out at you\nAnd when I went through my third three hundred four hundred and five hundred read reports started making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four five six thousand then things really start to delineate out one thing that's about ...\nHit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine strip search and rescue the canine ths can't find a set and they can't track the person down\nNow someone who worked at a canine unit on the farm team for a number of years our dogs had about a Ninety nine percent capture rate and\nProbably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week and it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be\nAnd there's a lot of people out there don't have the time the train a dog a lot there might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe the ... isn't there I've had reports where the dogs are brought to the set location where the person was last seen they walk a foot they turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out like\nThey don't want to search or they have no interest\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change weather event\nIf the victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times but time of the disappearance a high high percentage of the time if three four five PM\nMany of the victims have some type of disability homeless or congenital abnormality\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can't explain what happened to him water plays a key role in this if the person disappears very near water or they're found in or near water\nBoulders and granite play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world she was Seventy national park\nOr that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anywhere in the world but rare plays much more of a role as I explained and many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation\nYou're walking down the trail with your friends or your loved one and they walk ahead of you you fall behind them\nAt that point of separation something happens and that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that and interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report that's where it happens\nIt's almost like something's watching and when you split off from a group or a family that's when they move in\nYeah equipment now function and this is a this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and prior books there was an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with these searches\nAnd then people talk about other equipment their car other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this and then the last one is I've written about many many\nHighly intellectual people that have vanished\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physicists of a German heritage that have disappeared I'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and I've never been found\nIt's very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared but isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a\nMedical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nSo when when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that I'm interested in the specific\nProfile that I just laid out here\nAnd there's a this geographical fostering that I figured out why after I started putting pens that a U.S map when I started to track this years ago\nAnd right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada now there are other locations in eleven other countries of the world where these this exact same sort of thing happening a\nLot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book started to get rolling and people are different parts of the world right um [noise] they say hey you know I live in New Zealand we've had a whole series of these\nTrue Australia same thing you case same thing Canada same thing in Spain in the eighties worse I mean you'd be surprised how this fits into this little niche\nUm and it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred thirty five cases and it's men to women as a four to one ratio correct I\nAny idea why why so many more men than women maybe more men are out in the outdoors and out there alone\nYeah yeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risks than women I guess\nWe're talking with David ... about his latest work missing for one one land air water coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific cases and uh as I said before they will raise the hair on the back of your neck of the Beatles take us into the break we'll be right back\nRight um talk for a moment about search and rescue parameters\nIt becomes key to you picking the cases that use zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data um search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and in a huge database and I would think\nGives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been ruled to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most times other times they want there is a case from eighty six\nI'm an era the girl's name was ... she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody's looked at the case in Twenty years and especially if they're told me I'll never see that case\nIt's a standard missing persons case there is no suspects there's no crime why can't I see it\nUm and just so people understand in law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal uh everything else in the law enforcement world is criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against water go missing if you want to fall out of society you can and it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's going to eliminate from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle you're somebody\nBut these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nAnd a lotta times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times that are really really good and I don't understand why there and want us to see it but there's this I called territorial behavior\nAnd many of the times they won't grant you access\nNow in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law that reports have to be disposed to the public upon the crust\nColorado has outlaws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law\nBut many states don't and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything um so the first thing is you got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say the storage you really can't trust the media\nBecause I Would say eighty percent of the time when I finally get a copy the report\nThe news reports are totally completely wrong compared to what law enforcement said happened\nAnd I like to think back Thirty years ago forty years ago when there were reporters that really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's the superficial job of collecting information\nBecause it's really not too good these days\nWell I Would think that um you know reporters just regular beat reporters who get assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case\nYou know like outside of Las Vegas and then a couple that you and I've talked about before it's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement if there's a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of the scene I'm who tells you specific to your the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take it further you you just murder them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they really don't want to know the whole story of what's going on to this too weird to explain\nIt makes me wonder about the national Park Service whether they don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks or they don't want to give me the information because they have in a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know they don't want to have to answer questions about what do you think\nI think that the people the frontline people that you see when you go into the parks\nHeart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking you about nature those people have no idea what's going on it's the people at the top tier in the government\nThat are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed and communicated and it's those individuals that have this\nThey exude this belief that it's their stuff it's not yours and you're not going to get it and I don't understand it\nI Can't explain it and every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports when a sheriff's office helped on a search\nAnd they had some of the report from the national Park Service as well and mistakenly they just sent me everything\nAnd so I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and I got ... I wasn't supposed to get that but then it gives me some insight as to what's going on but it's rare\nLet's talk about a couple of cases uh you you sent me some information about one Samantha sailors what's the deal there\nSo twenty eight years old high performing person good athlete came from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle She liked to go to this a location or called ... per\n... V. E. S. P. E. R. and she went there on August first this year it's about six thousand two hundred and twenty feet elevation two miles northeast a spate of lake twenty five ... five miles east\nOf the ocean Puerto Suzanne round trip hike up about seven eight miles twenty seven hundred foot game going up\nAnd a Thirteen hundred foot scramble to the top\nSo I live in Colorado I can tell you that that really isn't much here but in in Washington that's a pretty good hike and the mountains there it just sixty two hundred feet look a lot like the mountains here fourteen thousand feet well\nSamantha did a lot right she told her boyfriend where she was going when she'd be back and she was the kind of the guys that kept track of her well when she didn't check in with him\nHe reacted the right way he went he went out and look for her while the investigation showed that she made some at some time to in between two and three in the afternoon and some other individual band saw her at the ... summit in communicated with her\nWell that was the subsequent investigation her boyfriend Kevin arrived at the mountain about ten pm started running the trails yelling for screaming for\nEventually called the snow homeless county sheriff and the search was on so that was on August first well that search went on for about twenty two days three hundred and fifty seven air operations that is extraordinary that's a lot\nHundred and five hours of drone time a three hundred and twenty nine hours of difference our personnel the family was on the scene everyday when you look at the area the majority of the time she was above what looked to be\nShow up at the top of desperate it's a pretty wide open area\nAnd for them not to be able to find her under these circumstances is really really unusual they add cadaver dogs they had sent tracking dogs that everything you can imagine there to help well eventually when the sheriff and the search and rescue personnel pulled out\nI mean that's that's a check on reality time if you're the family because you're looking at going back to Pennsylvania without your daughter and basically just Chuck it in with no more assistance with his family had a lot of gumption they start pushing harder they did some Kickstarter campaigns\nAre trying to pay for a food and things for friends that were just stand on site and search and day and night well eventually and I don't even know how somebody wanted me to get to talk to the mom and the mom and I communicated and I kinda gave them this road map\nAnd it's the same thing I've said is that you've got to get these reports otherwise you're just going to be replicating the exact same effort that search and rescue stung before that a lot of instances that may turn some results because\nPeople are found in areas that have been previously search that's true but if they have a lot of area where they said that they haven't searched it very thoroughly and the state that on the reports which they do and that Syria you really want to give it a big push\nBut the mom told me that they weren't getting any cooperation from the sheriff the sheriff wouldn't get many reports the search and rescue people weren't given him any reports and they were getting frustrated now this is the same thing I tell every family and if there's one listening out there is this what you have to do\nYou don't go to the local news media and you you don't understand this church is the local news media has to deal with the sheriff in that county day in and day out for the rest of their lives they can't burn a bridge they can't get 'em irritated they have to live with them but they national bureaus\nFox CBS NBC CBS the national bureaus you want to get one of those people in there and you want them to start stirring it

a junior I'm trying to figure out when Kavanaugh was at Yale and they're both still in school but let's just say was sophomore year she did this happen to her\nThis happens to her are you telling me that there is no one in her life no one her mother her sister her best friend\nThat wasn't told but now when told doesn't go\nOh my gosh I remember yes it was that summer and all of a sudden you didn't want to go to any parties anymore\nWould you go to a party if you experienced what she experienced would you want to be by yourself at a party would you change fundamentally\nAt parties enough for your best friend to at least now be able to go I remember that you were really weird that summer\nThat didn't happen that didn't happen\nNobody remembers anything she doesn't remember the year that it happened and as the investigators pointed out she's changed this now four or five times\n\nWe can't help you you have to tell someone you have to tell the police we are not the country of the Nineteen forties we [laughter]\nI Want to make sure that nobody goes to jail that is innocent\nBut you know what that requires not social justice not believing the accuser but looking at the facts you say you're for prison reform and at the same time\nYou will not look at facts you only want to do with the mob mentality you only want to go with what is politically correct and deliver social\nJustice you say you're against uh putting innocent people behind bars and\nThat our justice system is so corrupt that it is put black man behind bars because of white society look at what you're doing right now\nAnd if you were honest about the way you actually feel think of the the construct that is built by\nThe left all police are really bad people that are going to a throat innocent black people in jail\nOr ... white people are racist against black people how would how would let's say real racist cops and racist women or deal with an African American who they say has a salted them in the past\nThink of the standard you're creating black people have been victims of this in the past where they were a unfairly accused of crimes I mean you can go back to Emmett Till right like you can go back there is a lot of these things that have happened over the years you were asking for that standard to return\nHow are you going to react when a black man is is accused unfairly about some assault they didn't commit are you going to believe the white woman then\nI I did standards they are creating is insane and I feel for the woman in the elevator you can tell she passion I don't know if it's about politics or not I don't know her story federal the one thing I Do know about her story is Brett Kavanaugh wasn't responsible for it he had no\nRole in what happened to her no no role no responsibility none now\nThe argument on the other side is we're only asking for five more days we're only asking for five more days well\nIf everyone was quiet for five days\nThat would be something okay we've got five days to look at this we have we have until next friday to look at it but that's not what they're doing they've now moved the goalposts mhm they're using these seven days to come up with something new to move the goalpost she lied about you know how much he drank\nNo heat oh my gosh\nRight there and now they're saying well yes you gave us the FBI investigation but it's not throwing up it's not enough time the only thing here is there delay tactics and that how you can tell that and I think we're up and I'll be honest enough to understand\nIf Brett Kavanaugh let's just say politics failing and flake and Collins and Murkowski bail and the the vote comes down and he gets voted down\nThere won't be a soul who gives a crap about this woman story\nThey will all do they will not even she will not get a phone call\nReturned 'cause you can still investigate this by the way there is no there's no statute of limitations on felony sexual assault in Maryland they could still go after this the second Kavanaugh is not in that seat they will forget about her and she will be a non story because they don't care about her story had nothing to do that they're just trying to light is to try to get it passed the electorate\nNow here's the here's this the second point I Want to make 'em Republicans\n\nIf this fall through and the very next

whatever\nThere is one guy that has already gone through all of a confirmation hearings one guy who is already at every FBI background check one guy that everybody in the Senate knows and that's Mike

need to delay\nHe's already had all those FBI background checks and each senator knows exactly who he is he's qualified jeeze clean\nQuick you could get that done long before the election if I hear

um Thanksgiving dinner now you you saw that the military and I talked about this last week the big hubbub over a Congressman Paul go starts family\nIn door saying and doing video and it got nasty I'm asking is opponents apology are pretty bad it was that was ugly and by the way show no a congressman goes or will be live in the studio here on Thursday with me and we're gonna address that and other issues I always have a great time in Congress and go sir I spent\nTime with us but it is your family like most families all over the place politically yes\nNow I have two brothers that are a left wing guys and my dad he's a conservative and my mom's conservative and my grandfather was ... I mean and every time we have Thanksgiving dinner or Christmas dinner it's a leave your liberalism at the door um depending on where you're eating\n[laughter] cash or go into now do you hear your too liberal brothers did they support you are they working against you they support me a hundred percent yes even have different ...\nWe have this some different ideology um and we we we give them debate\nA civil debate um but at ... at the end of the day we're family we love each other and um anything that happens on on an our side of the door stays there when I leave the door it doesn't end up on a Fox News or commercial\nYeah and that's what's so shocking with Congress and goes to the last time he was on\nA someone was tweeting who had the same last name as him and a tweeting very negative things and I so I had to ask I sent congressman cos are Texas who's this guy is us my brother and I was ... you know can't be and and I\nYou know my family um my siblings are all\nI Would say very much more liberal than me and my mom is my dad is more or maybe aligned with me I shouldn't be given that I'm Still in the family is here but I think I've talked about this before but I Would say there's probably more anti Trump sentiment and more liberal sentiment in my family than not but\nYou know we were written each other and and uh you know joke so close and very heated arguments about things but they have passed passed that\nThe turkey yep pass a turkey and and you know we're doing this and and married you know ... at the end of a long day campaign day and you've got people just you know beat up\nThe one place you want to go to Jeff you you were part of this too is your family it 'cause that's the one you know caught us they've got to work there if you don't have that in this line of work you know it's it's pretty tough\nYeah and I got to do more than I tell you then when I was on council now there is no such thing eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven when Jerry neighbors and I are here with wall Blackmon\nWell I I have to ask you there's a lot of talk about this proposition one twenty seven yes and this is the one about requiring Arizona that have up to fifty percent of quote renewable energy doing away with a nuclear power plant doing away with\nProbably all coal burning and knows a natural gas\nWhere you're coming from what's your position all during his building it's\nIt's bad it's about proposition it's going to increase our our rate or a luxury rates up to about fifty for some ... percent fifty percent yeah you know the the bottom line is you know for for example I pay like three hundred bucks for electricity 'cause my ... my kid leave the door they leave the door open [laughter]\n[laughter] okay so you know I'm looking at six hundred dollars if this thing pass a man plus what's not being told is the infrastructure that has to go into this who's paying for this\nIs California going to play for this they're not going to pay for this this is going to be added on to the tax payers as an additional costs and I don't think we're looking at that also so we're gonna be paying more that's out there so bottom line is and simple English if you want to double\nYour electric rate then you want to vote for this and you have all the money in the world if you don't want to do that then don't vote for this\nAll right let me be devil's advocate well you're in favor of pollution you're in favor of ruining the world [laughter] why don't you get on board and help the world I bet you you even support straw use oh my\nGoodness so you know check this out of the where I live a place called Choi him okay that is closing we can convert that to a waste to energy a facility\nNow I'm for the environment but to do it in a way that smart it's not going to we're not going to spend a taxpayer dollars on me to sleep and also having Californians are Tom style to be exact coming in and try to change the way we do business\nIn Arizona it that's just not going to work so uh we have to do we have to get better at a ... voters\nThese propositions we have to do our research we can't leave it up to the law makers just to say okay this is out there and just a vote how you will and then we have bad laws on the on the books\nWe have to do research we have to get in the weeds and and do the work and uh we have to do the hard things and the hard thing is I don't want to pay for this I don't want to pay half\nOf my electricity that I'm paying now so\nBut does anyone that's the trouble with these kinds of things this is Jerry was saying it's an emotional things so they'll say\nYou don't support this you insert anything you hit the earth yeah you want your kids that whatever whatever issue may be\nUm it's a thirty Second World\nAnd then you have a complex law that's trying to be passed state wide that's very complex multiple multiple pages and people don't read that they go with the\nUh and I'm not saying it's because people aren't intelligent can't understand is that what I'm saying because they're busy they're trying to figure out how to pay that utility bill there rolling their are she got had to pay their high taxes you know and they they winds up being an emotional tug of war\nYeah and and you can't make law on emotion you can't do that doesn't doesn't make any sense to do that you're going to hurt more people at the end of the day than you would helping them\nAnd and what I object to is making law on a two sentence description\nProposition yeah yeah if I walked a you get down there\nA first of all the ballots are going out is it it's coming up as an ex yeah it's coming out about two weeks or it's got to be coming up soon in France already out it stays October first again leaving there were getting will be a we're getting the sample ballot so I got my first time too yeah yeah ours is we've got so many\nTaxing issues here it's all it's a it's not a it's a novel this girl is like an Egyptian school or whatever where girls from the thing is so long yeah there's so much on it well okay let's\nYou when you get down there you get sworn in a beginning of January start session a you've talked about communication especially in rural or Internet service things like that but what she wants your big thing\nBut do you want to crank we've got to get a hold of this education they education funding we we we have you know I Want teachers to get paid or what their work\nI think that's important we also need to take a good look at the common core our last I'm a superintendent lives of education says it there's no more Common Core\nUm however I Want it to my daughter's classroom and she has a stack of books that say Common Core so um you know I and I wasn't uh I didn't fall hit my head that day when I asked that question so in order for us to succeed\nAnd our future we need to make sure that we do smart banks we need to take a look at the budget when he to inform people are teachers on how they're getting paid who's paying the teachers school boards\nThe L legislator does not control contracts with teachers\nSo that's the first step to satisfy that we need to do away with Common Core common cold is not helping our country any better but certainly are her youth and and those are those are the two things that I really want to grab a hold of\nA when I get down there and of course veterans' issues that's a that's near and dear to my heart we have a lot of veterans in this part of the this part of the state and um I Want to do more to help them\nAbsolutely alright well black men candidate for a legislative districts six we wish you the best and and we look forward to having yawned again real soon or good thanks [noise] All right folks are we do want to get your comments your thoughts eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one you're listening to Jeff ... show back in a minute [noise]\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter] oh great\nThanks a lot eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven when I don't know what happened in that it might be a moot point because you know the rule is\nOne from Arizona ever becomes president\nAnd what does he run as a Republican opposing President Trump\nIs that or is he running as an independent I mean you already here you don't run as an independent and win but I guess going for conservatives aren't going to vote for him um I don't get it I I don't know what happened and I don't know what happened in his elevator ride last week but everything changed after that\nThe story that as I'm hearing it is that he realized\nThey were not going to have a Republican majority on the floor and so he was trying to do something to at least keep the Republicans on board there we're going to be a couple of Republican defector Collins and Murkowski and so he wanted to keep them\nIn line and so this was the compromise if we do a one week investigation will you vote for\nA cabinet on the floor and apparently they they said yes because\nYou know obviously they count the votes and said we have no choice because we're we're three short smoke now because of like Murkowski and Collins or in a mansion was kind of like in that pack as well as as a Republican from West Virginia I Believe\nUh eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one But Jerry does this kind of compromise before moving on some other issues there's this kind of compromise ever work you you set up as mayor for four and a half years and tried to compromise\nIn the name of diversity and and this comes just crashing back to meet with Walt Walt like means interview that we just did about how the far left\nTo cries and screams diversity put signs up outside the town but then when you are different man they come crashing down don't they do is there a compromise with them it doesn't usually seem that way a\nAn all Jeff it's it's like they want liberals want something from the conservatives but they're not willing to go back the other direction\nThat's been my experience so what will come of Jeff Flake quote unquote compromise is a there will be more allegations that come up before this was all over or they will dig and dig they wanted to lay it\nWill any of the Democrats decided to vote all of a sudden for governor no no I mean come on ... where does this go it goes nowhere it's seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one All right here's another one um I and I got a lot of listeners us and maybe you to Jerry [noise] are you taking a vacation this year\nBecause you know you got to be careful nowadays with 'em and this isn't a commercial him yet you got to be careful now with ah your books with what you post on Facebook with everything you do because it's being catalogued and then later on you're going for a job interview and it's going to come up\nBut now you you got to be careful who you tell because of the class warfare specialists they're watching and you may be branded as something like I don't know a ... millionaire\nCheck to check to see what's ...\nMillion or this is from and this is are the issues that we continue to follow which is the wage issue which is haunting a lot of cities in this nation Fifteen dollars and fifty cents for ... for example by two thousand twenty two\nIf the highest minimum wage in the nation Flagstaff need to raise first of all the yes on for Eighteen is trying to slow that down and we've talked extensively about this are trying to cap it at about twelve fifty and then it would in flight as the state wage goes up but it's like seventies or raise who's opposing capping that they want it to go to Fifteen fifty\nThey had this to post on Facebook\nAnd this was from a few days back quote as Flagstaff millionaires vacationing combo the low wage workers who made them ... ... ... the low wage workers who made them rich struggle to feed their kids\nSo now if you go to on vacation to copy of your um\nYour brand it as a millionaire\nAnd if someone is built a business at great risk and sacrifice to themselves\nAnd has employed\nThese people given him a job\nNow suddenly you're the bad guy\nThat's just the first sentence the low wage workers who made them rich now now keep in mind I looked up ... I I've been to ... have you ever been to ... know long long time long time ago ... that is [noise]\nA lot of folks a lot of um middle income folks go there on vacation and it's a few thousand dollars it's it's not cheap but it's not\nA bunch of rich people fuel enough to check on down there it's it's designed these hotels are designed for just rich people or else there's not enough rich people to fill all these rooms you see everywhere like Hubble I was certainly not rich [laughter]\nYeah I've been down to ... twice and and yeah I I flew coached on their age seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven what's on your mind\nOn air what's on your mind well after a just like it I really want men most of the competition mhm and I think we ought to repeal the seventh seventh eighth amendment look it up\nSays ... will fill in real quick what does this amendment is that where the U.S Senate senators are voted in a large rather than the legislature picking them\nBack in ... and if you go back and check all that got through I think we all go back to the state level ... great they all look at the history whoa that's yup oh by the way it got through the same year\nAnd come back\nSo rough year man it was a rough year was that Nineteen Thirteen thirteenth they know you're after Arizona became statehood then we got the federal income tax which you know you never getting rid of that unfortunately the older brings a great\nReminder that the senators used to be selected as the state legislature\nYes Larry to send them to Washington great call appreciate that eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety someone and there's a reason for that because it's ... once the senators elected at large like we do now Jerry\nBut we didn't do that for the first two hundred and twenty plus years before that right right the legislature used to pick amongst whoever wild and a lot of times that come from their body because the house was considered\nKind of the people's house it's every two years\nIt's ... districts and there's many of them versus two senators per state and if the senator and great cause the senators starts doing weird stuff in a six year term ledge they say hey we're done with you we're going to point someone else because you're not doing doing your job and senators on all of them but a lot of them become very disconnected now because they're centers\nYou know I don't see one sitting in here talking with US Congressman goes starts going to talk Thursday right oh yeah\nAll right let's do this we'll take more calls more thoughts or I Want to get back to this are you a ... millionaire 'cause I only read the first sentence and there's a lot more to it but we're going to take a quick break eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven when you're listening to Jeff where would show back in the middle [noise]\nThat's yeah for a show Monday through friday at three PM [laughter] I'm not going to have a white\nBe a tough year [noise]\nFolks you've heard me talk about twilight janitorial you\nKnow that's why like janitorial company I use for all my business cleaning I use twilight janitorial because I Need a great cleaning service for my business and I know you do to\nSo focused on your business not on cleaning it and let twilight janitorial handle all your company's cleaning give twilight janitorial a call today ninth to eight eight five three eighty sixty four that's twilight janitorial\nNine to eight eight five three eighty sixty four\nWendy for for for the deal you could count on every day no cats do that just for item for four bucks a day or for want of a great off is like the double by kicking rap or junior bacon cheeseburger fries and a drink of oatmeal for four dollars only and why did he said that's added\nValue multiplied by good because the report what you need when you need to turn that car out there waiting\nFor a limited time for Easter and like a small price is more valid Alaska and Hawaii staples knows business everything is you can't put off until tomorrow what you need to do now\nYou don't need to prince sometimes you have to be able to at any time\nWhich is why it's Naples your drinking donor is always in stock and always rise low then during staples sprinting event prices are even\nRight now it's who's getting twenty five dollars off any do H.
