goes on out there that's got a crab they were dealing with today in the capital as you had the protesters and again from a political movement standpoint\nWho doesn't want to be part of that is why leave ideology and by the wayside for a moment one of the things I've never been able to get my brain around\nHow especially young people go yeah those people make a lot of sense you know what I should be due I should be part of that now let's be real for a mom and a lot of\nThose folks in D.C are ... ... they're paid\nThese are folks who don't have lives the rest of us we got to work with wives\nAnd we uh you know go about our business letter the day and go okay that's what the losers are up to today yes those are all the losers ruptured today the losers that go out there and they get paid and in many cases they end up getting paid more if they are willing to get arrested so yes they do they are those people but nevertheless\nJust in terms of winning hearts and minds it's fascinating now\nThat's the segments talking about police talking about law enforcement and we've had obviously this immigration debate that's gone on for ever and a seemingly no resolution inside but the other um aspect of\nThat conversation that often is April ... ... refugees and I have long had\nMy focus on refugees for a couple of reasons one is principal and the other the implications of refugees now a lot\nSo it wasn't big in the news cycle because obviously we know what the news cycle has been\nBut a lot was made that we ended up having the u._s. refugees in decades at least since Nineteen Seventy five according to the state department oh my gosh we're not importing you know even more people are into the United states and paying for all that to happen\nOr ... according to PBS at the end of August only Nineteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety nine refugees had been brought in the prior eleven months compared to forty five thousand our anticipated oh my gosh and that was a bad thing right\nAnd then they went on to talk about how we're only anticipating three thousand being brought in next year oh my gosh that's just terrible now here's one is often not discussed the implications\nThe implications when are we going to be compassionate to Americans before we tried to be compassionate to the rest of the world\nHere's the way this works what you're not told\nWe as taxpayers pay to bring the refugees into the United states average cost tends to be around fourteen thousand dollars per refugee and according to the center for Immigration Studies a typical immigrant guess what happens when they get here where they live on government assistance for a minimum of five years\nAnd the average five year cost per refugee sixty four thousand three hundred and Seventy bucks now you're ready\nTo hear how much it costs to relocate a refugee into a safe zone if we get involved\nA thousand fifty seven bucks so we can actually relocate Bronx only sixty four refugees into safe zones without importing them into the United states\nAnd by the way Ninety One percent of refugees we bring into the United states end up on food stamps and sixty eight percent also ended up receiving ongoing welfare other programs made available now how compassionate is that\nToday we found out that we have the lowest unemployment rate in many decades three point seven percent\nHow is it that we made progress with those that have been long term unemployed those that had the toughest time those that were not as educated that weren't skilled how have we made improvement in young unemployment anybody ever think that maybe cracking down on illegal immigration\nAnd not bringing in refugees to compete for entry level work might make a difference\nSomething that's never discussed back on June seventh of last year I actually made the case for how it could happen and we have seen over the past year plus exactly that\nIs it anywhere near the entire reason now but it absolutely is part of the reason people automatically suggest that we have a responsibility and that kind of cost to import people in the competed against the most vulnerable in our society\nIs there really cared about the most vulnerable in society you give them the opportunity\nTo ask what Donald Trump is doing his policy once again [noise]\nOmission is the most pervasive form of bias in the media to start the story one side of the fact I probably am I and for the great one mark or the [noise]\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel whoever the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the IRS he didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief\nWhat you don't hear the for cops that have been killed in line of duty over the past week and their families the widows kids without fathers that's what's real\nAnd if not for us then then who's going to be so as a again every cop is a good one but now hundreds of thousands almost all of them are and God Bless them because if not for them where or any of us are any of us\nAnd uh let's see I I Believe we're actually getting in right now on the line that the police officer oh go ahead and go right to you you get to the front of the line because you're another the police officer want to hear from you in go\nAhead see are you tonight\nHey doing well\nFantastic now I just wanted to comment that I have to agree with all your saying I've been in law enforcement now for six years and it's especially with coming from my department you\nYou just see a face to face 'cause we we are in a college town itself so I'm everything that the media puts out towards is you're definitely feeling it especially from the younger generation who only been taught that way and it's like one interaction after another where you're trying to change that\nGod Bless you man and the folks who served with you um you know there is one thing I'll tell you in a again I Do this series down here in South Florida every\nWeek I Will tell you that there is a lot of support kind of like the silent majority that came out and made Donald Trump president elected more Republicans top to bottom the United states of America in twenty sixteen than at any other point since Nineteen twenty eight\nOf us out there are a lot of good folks that that really do get it in that do support you and I know just often isn't depicted in the media and certainly with many politicians but but the stay strong and and thank you guys were all you do uh\nAppreciate it was which gears go back to senator Collins and her big day Joe in Gainesville, Florida Joe go\n[noise] [noise]\nHey Joe\nJoe Europe [noise]\nAlright Joe you're you're you're up let's go to Glen in Springfield, Illinois\nGlenn go to Brian uh can you hear me good yeah we got you\nOkay hey hey for taking my call and thank you for all that you know I'm I'm calling uh some central Illinois I'm proud to say that Springfield is my home town\nThat's where I'm calling from but I'm I'm afraid to say I'm not proud that turban from my own south Mm yeah\nI heard some of the comments that he made the other day a face to face to Brett Kavanaugh and I was appalled\nAh that's there's no uh respect there no oh I Know a professional demeanor now and I think that Dick Durbin and and and I'm saying it I Want to his constituents Springfield, Illinois take care of an old saying that apology\nAnd ... and I I I credit\nSenator college it's refreshing that she took the time to sit down with this man and get a one on one card I caught a conversation with him I gave her credit for that\nNo doubt she her find this moment and uh you're absolutely right about German and all the others I mean how many politicians are we we started with Chuck Schumer today in the\nChuck Schumer sexual assault allegation a line [laughter] he\nBefore we heard or anything from from Christine Ford before we had any\nFacts present it said that he believes her in what happened in this country in part because of people like Dick Durbin because of people like Chuck Schumer who said that they believed her\nThat's all part of the damage that was done in this country go to Anthony in New York Anthony go\nHey guys how are you all doing very much for your for your great show I I just wanted to say I'm finally proud of the Republicans I'm an independent but I really finally proud of the Republicans they started fighting back\nUh it looks like a karate kid number three hundred and sixty or where you know Mr me I ate trout goes out not just a ... a family that had to fight back\nAgainst the village and these democratic definitely didn't expect is so they they they got there they got it handed to them so\nYou got an interesting take here this is not something that's been advanced or at least in my presence before I'm I'm interested if you get your take using that potentially Donald Trump being Donald Trump may be provided the\nNecessary Jews\nFor Chuck Grassley to figure out that he's not washed job for Susan Collins ago holy cow I Do have the backbone for Lindsey Graham do I don't know it actually intend to be smart against is that kind of what you're you're talking about here\n... ... really because I mean if you remember when Trump Card and every time every time they were clearly something everybody everybody would go hide under rocks\nAnd now they're all coming that are fighting back and they're standing up and I mean it's amazing I mean I get Lisa Murkowski or tick tick tick the beehive and then turn around and when he stepped in it but ah it's okay she I actually I Hope she knows how to say welcome to Wal Mart once you get once it gets thrown out of it or not that again so\nI thought that as far as the rest of them go finally proud of them are standing up and doing the right thing\nArguably Walmart deserves better but I appreciate that that's a really really compelling thought a good call Anthony in New York there\nStay in New York for a moment and let's go to Frank Frank spin extremely patient of rank\nGo yes or ... or I Would just like to say a high or support or\nThe or confirmation of a justice\nBrett Kavanaugh but I just want to find out I I I've been thinking about this the whole entire\nWeek what's wrong with these Democratic senators how can they keep believing the stories that from the from the lady uh but\nActually they actually don't know what the procedural issues are in the Senate they don't understand what they're talking about when they're accusing of Brett Kavanaugh of things they have the actual physical evidence in regards to miss the capital has showed every bit of evidence he's proven where the timeframe where he's been\nAnd what he has done throughout his life and they continually for some reason\nTo believe that what they hear from this woman is actually true I'm not saying whether it is or is it's not\nBut I Believe I'm Sorry a or a ... I made five boroughs democratic where we're from the city of New York I have a different understanding of different things but I I feel very sad that these Democratic senators in Congress are confused in regards to\nWhat they're thinking feel about Brett Kavanaugh as a whole I think they should give this guy won the last ... and then we will see if they were writing their role as they should actually think about resigning\nInteresting a very interesting call their ... and I understand given your political disposition why you were inclined to travel down the bad they've given them one more chance\nMy mind on all of ultimately is a ... a bit more uh maybe cynical which is you know if it's the by any means necessary and uh you know politics\nTrump's all the pun intended\nBut uh it trusting I especially coming from a Democrat or to hear that on principle you think there comes a point and we're close to it to where these people should resign alright or I Am by mud in for the

I was listening earlier and I was just wanting to say um [noise] we just need to really mellow out [laughter]\n[laughter] we really do there is there's just so much a negativity\nAnd so much pressure in the culture right now that I I think it's just feeding this kind of mass anxiety and uh\nMaybe that's part of what what um you know I'll be talking about tonight with with the tower oh because uh uh tools like a tarot cards or believe it or not [laughter] um are very very helpful for remembering who we are and\nI'm letting go of all of the uh beliefs in programming and constructions and opinions and a cultural biases and all of that it's it's a way of suspending all of\nThat stuff and taking a deep breath and receiving um through images through pictures that come to us from a really a\nMysterious place nobody knows the origin of the courage to tell you the truth we know some things about it\nIt ultimately the child is a mystery we know that it it it descends from ancient mystery schools and a ancient wisdom that it has been called the perennial philosophy [noise]\nUm but there is something a universally relevant for everyone in the ...\n[noise] how far back you have we been able to track the\nUh Thirteen Ninety I Believe is the earliest evidence or fourteen twenty is the first full deck that we know about in the accounting and\nRenaissance but no one knows who the first desire was actually in I I really like that I think it's part of what tarot is ultimately it's it comes from the human imagination\nMaybe it was given to us from\nUh from above or from beyond or below [laughter]\nBelow or within and you know I'm a union psychologist so ah we've then is the place that I look\nLet's explain to people who probably knew what it looks like what they might not know exactly what it is\nUm it's a tool for self exploration it comes out of the Italian Renaissance um it's not was not brought a\nTo Europe by the gypsies as is often miss misinformed\nOr actually the gypsies chain quite a bit after the first ... started to emerge a in Italy and Spain um other places in Europe\nUh it is a deck of cards um and uh in in some ways it's it's not clear which came first the playing cards at the terrible cards and actually\nIf you think of the standards set of playing cards that is equivalent roughly to what's called\nThe minor are Connor\nOf the ... the terrible has an additional twenty two cards that is called the major are coming up and these are the cards um that people commonly\nUh think of when they think of Cairo cards you know they have they have the magician Ryan gold card a fool\nAnd wheel of fortune and things like that\nAnd that's your favorite car George yes it is [laughter] see her because I'm fascinated\nBy it I Know I Know you are\nAnd it is it is an extremely a beautiful card the scarred as is the devil card\nAnd the tower usually three cards which people think are the most uh uncomfortable parts of the major our economy but every card in the tower jak has a positive and negative aspect\nI'm In the modern tarot which is really my forte um has really moved since uh you know ... it became very a cult oriented in the\nUh nineteenth and a early twentieth century England with the\nSociety of the Golden Dawn and that's where the modern tarot really was birds with the uh weight jak or the Arthur wait ... the writer weight tarot and what what uh what happened then was very exciting in the world of ... and that [noise]\nFor the first time the minor are con which are like playing cards a deck of playing cards each one of the tips or the miners are we're finally illustrated with rich dynamic\nPictures that tell a story before that time only the majors only the the pardon the expression Trump Card\n... where we're going to talk about that on their right\nBut I'm\nOnly those had pictures that you could actually just look at directly and\nGet an impression of any kind of just kind of sense of what it was going on there the miners before or the twentieth century um just had geometric design so if they're forced suits you know like like hearts clubs diamonds and what's the other one\nUh ...\nRight those are equivalent to the ... the terrorists shoots of a cops shorebirds tentacles ... won ... and all of the those minor cards she's had geometric\nShapes on them so that was a seven of cops there\nWould be a just a picture of seven challenges on it say and that's all you had to go by now there is a very rich dynamic a image that goes with the meaning of that card and\nUh there are probably six or seven hundred ... a new and different tarot decks today out on the market\nBut they all pretty much followed this the basic tarot convention showed that it doesn't really matter which jak you're using and some are very out there even my deck is pretty out there\nAnd you came up with your own new yes\nCorrect um but it's the same architect so you know the card is in the car has an image and the idea is that with an archetype an archetype is virtually any exhaust herbal but\nIt's only known through an image or archetype ... image\nSo uh like Joseph cambell wrote a great book called the uh what is it called the uh uh can thousand names of the uh I Can't even remember what book I'm referring to but the idea is slate George\nA lawyer there's land [laughter] I Love it though [laughter] but the the idea is that uh every\nArchetype like say the cherry edge or where are the hero here with a thousand with the housing faces or with whatever the name of that book as\nCan be a illustrated and many many ways if no one image that describes an archetype so that lends itself to artistic interpretation so terrorists also a richly interesting a\nVisual art and different tarot decks emphasize different aspects of the archetype but it's the same\nArchetype or it's the same a principle um and when we talk about the archetypes I'm In a union since\nI'm we're with terror we are talking about a special group of archetypes in these are called what Yom Carl you own the great a Swiss psychologist and philosopher to her [noise]\nCalled the archetypes of transformation unless\nYou were with a thousand seasons that's thank you think this guy\nUm [noise] but it's it's the archetypes of transformation is what the major are kind of the ...\nThat means these are the images are the archetypes there are all about spiritual transformation and are not in a religious sense\nIt's all you need this fall went to a client please lots of last last only during the week after an atheist hurry now through October and

I don't want to save your life I don't care about you I'm Sorry I I carry a gun to save me and my family I don't carry a gun to say you\nOh okay well it's like why why why would I Want to hear what they said why would I Want to say if you will you won't save you true yeah well I I don't know anybody who\nCares a gun to save you know including the police police okay you're going to save you\nLose carrying a gun to save themselves there's nobody carrying a gun to save you you understand that right\nNow I didn't understand that a lot of people say they carry again so they can protect everybody\nSo yeah and that's not have you ever taken a concealed carry class I have not no [noise] you know what's taught in a concealed class no I've just been told what have you been told\n'em that it's not very hard I mean it's pretty easy to tell you had to pull the hammer back pulled the trigger how to aim 'em but nothing ever they don't tell you anything like ah there's no kind of scenarios if there's any kind of chaos or any kind of even controlled chaos so it's kinda scary\nI'm going to make a suggestion 'cause I don't know who you talk to because it I honestly I don't think you talk to anybody who's actually has the permit because once you get with the class is hours and hours of instruction on the wall\nAnd when you can shoot when you can shoot what you have to do what you can't do a how to avoid situations\nI'm just I'm Amazed that you think that they teach you to shoot accidental teachers shooting all\nHis the reality of it because you know carry a class does almost ... training whatsoever no and it makes me feel safer just our world and here's a here's the problem you have a very strong opinion based on absolutely no information at all\nOkay how does that make you feel\nI'm I'm pretty sure got information I mean I live in the state of Texas I I Believe uh I I mean I work at a location where the employee that I'm pretty sure thirty eight of them forty of them carrying guns they all have their license I'm I've talked to a multiple of them\nAnd I mean that's the only information I have I I haven't personally and get ...\n... ... may\nI suggest your gun guy you've got the bedroom you don't have as soon as you can take the class without deciding to carry a gun\nYou may find it interesting\nTo go take the class and say oh\nNow I understand where people are talking about\nThat and and look I understand there are people who say well I carry a gun so I could save you yeah there's a little bit of that out there but the reality is most of us carry guns so we can save ourselves and our family and if something goes down I'm going to grab my family I'm going to leave\nAnd if you're in there I'm going to leave your Saudi Arabia and in there and I'm Sorry because you weren't smart enough to bring a God to take care of yourself\n[laughter] I said well that's what I was curious you know I just wanted to know your your thought on it and that was kinda it kinda made it pretty clear for\nAll right well look I keep asking questions and trying to get some information I assure you you have um a little bit skewed take on this\nIf you the more you study on it the more you will say oh okay I get that now and look it it's not for everybody I understand that some people look at and go I'm not going to carry I Would never carry that school don't have to master deal fine\nBut don't expect anybody including the police to come help you that's not their duty now once you understand one thing and this is fact you can take us to the bank\nThe police are not legally ... a post or they're not required\nTo help you if you're getting beaten up and stand right next to a police officer he or she is not required legally to come help you I don't know if you knew that but they've been meeting court cases that have ruined the police have no legal obligation to help anyone to protect anyone and so in the end\nAs always you're always on your own I Wish you

putting money away little at a time and I was talking about you know we talked about do you know how you feel a bucket full of water\nHow drop at a time\nOne little thing I'm a little bit of time right and so I think a lot of people are looking at the big the bucket and go wow how am I going to fill the bucket but\nIt's done systematically and it's done with intention so you know it is it's a very easy process if you\nGive it time so you know I always talked about you know I'm a procrastinator winter stuff you know especially if it has to do with manual labor yeah and uh you know I just moved I sold my house and I moved into another house that I own\nAnd I literally or didn't have time to get to the move and so when I started packing and and I had a deadline and you know I really did it to myself I put myself under so much pressure\nTo get everything done within a short period of time\nWhere I if I had the time I could have taken the time\nAnd done it systematically over a period of time where I was not stressing myself out so this is how I see people deal with retirement you know they're trying to feel that you haul with all their stuff\nIn a matter of five years when they had a you know twenty five or thirty a courier would they could have done it little at a time and they could have really approached this in a very\nSystematic and stress free manner so that's where we want to really talk about is how to take stressed out of your life\nAnd if it's stress free is happy you know so\nThis is the retirements roadmap show on the retirement networks [noise]\nWe're back thanks for joining us today on their retirement roadmap show powered by vora\nFinancial grill I'm generally that alongside ... more I eat owner and founder of lower our financial group dates are families across northern Arizona\nYou can find them online ad vora financial dot com that is vora V. as in Victor Oh our a financial dot com\nGarnish during our working years if we want to reduce our income taxes one way to do that it can make less income but what are some strategies for taxes in retirement\nYet you know reducing your income would be great just go talk to your employer and telling me on a pay cut ...\nIt can definitely ... you know but that's not realistic for anyone and so you know usually figure it out is I've been doing taxpayer with my clients for years now and what we found is that people that understand or are working with advisors that understand how to help them manage their taxes\nAre the ones going to pay less to the government and I would rather if I was you know if I was your advisor\nWouldn't you want me to make sure they keep more money for yourself scoring giving it to the government because you know what\nGovernment's not going to send you a little thank you carve a Christmas card a birthday card saying hey you know a great job they use all this money if I write so tax planning is really really critical because a lot of people don't understand or or they haven't looked at as you said don't understand is\nThat what you don't know you really don't know\nAnd so when we started doing planning with our clients you know what we're trying to help them understand is that here's how much money you're making\nAnd as years become you'll probably make more money because of your pay raises and so forth\nBut how do you keep more money for yourself and and if we can divert some of that money to go into your retirement account or have more money go into some tax favored investment strategies you that's where you're going to you know really create wealth\nBecause if you keep giving it away you're not going to have any for yourself because the government is going to be getting all your money\nAnd also understanding you know how the current tax law works and I think the new tax law those past I've been doing a lot of work shop at you know I'm the different uh community colleges throughout um northern Arizona\nOn retirement and taxes\nAnd it's interesting when I have people in those rooms and I ask questions about what do you think of the current tax law\nA quite a few people says I don't know and some people say well you know Trump passage there's gotta be\n... and not for us here's the thing I really don't care what the president and so you know this is not about you know political this is about the law the new tax laws in place you know we want to do is really understand it and\nUtilize it so that we can put more money in our pocket you know rather than give it to the government and if it's used correctly or in your finances you can actually save a lot of money on taxes and so what I've been doing is I've been talking about taxes in retirement\nAnd showing them all the opportunities there right there for us\nAnd most people aren't taking advantage of I Would say even one tenth\nOf one percent of the strategies and the new tax law because they don't know about it and a lot of their advisors don't know about it because most advisor said well you know I help you manage your money but taxes not really your cup of tea\nWill you know when you do comprehensive planning that's where we'll we were able to help people so that's one portion of it right\nThe other thing is a lot of people that are thinking about retirement or getting very very close or like ready to make some big decisions in their retirement such as Social Security\nWhat we're finding is that most people have no idea\nWhat is the best strategy for them I've had people say well you know we don't live very long you know family or I don't anticipate live very long so I'm going to take my money out a start taking money from Social Security so they can get their money out of it but\nThe reality is people are living in a lot longer modern medicine has come leaps and bounds from you know even five years ago or you know live on ten years ago right and and so a lot of things are changing for some people are living longer\nPeople a lot more youthful today than you know they've ever been and and you know I'm Talking to my\nClients in their sixties and seventies and eighties\nAnd the eighties is a new sixties in the sixties and the new forties who you know right in and think about it like if you look at your friends or your your family members and you go\nWow you know somebody's like Seventy Seventy five years old and you go well you're supposed to be this active you know because statistically you know I go back Twenty years\nPeople in their seventies they're like well our lives almost over my clients in their eighties are booking your vacations five years out and you know if you if you look around if you listen to the show you know people that are older but\nUseful I mean there are more active today than ever been in you know which is fantastic\nBut the downside to that is that people are going to live so long that they need to have money to last them a lifetime in without a plan\nThey're going to go go through that money and to me that's a significant concern when you don't planning\nAnd understanding how much money you're going to take out in retirement so one of the strategies is maximizing your Social Security benefit ... and how to get the most out of Social Security\nAnd that's one source of income in retirement there was actually a survey that was done by transfer America\nAnd this was done about a year ago and they said the fifty one percent of baby boomer\nFeel that they're building a strong enough nest egg settles ludicrous that fifty one percent right which is great you know what I mean which is good to see that people are excited and they are involved and so forth but you know here's really something we also have to look at you know what has the\nUh the temperament or the the weather has been in the in the stock market over the last ten years right\nAnd we've had a ten year bull market after the market correction in you know seven or eight the markets have been going up and we've almost a decade of fantastic I mean we've had ups and downs I mean it was a straight line up\nBut you can have peaks and valleys and all that stuff but we've had a bull market at the end of the day you know bull market me in some markets have been going up and bear market is markets we're going down and said a lot of times we'll confused that so I Want to clarify that sort of bull market I mean the market's going up\nSo if you're in a strong market conditions in your portfolio is have been growing and you've been taking a risk with your portfolio and of course you're going to feel confident and I'm not minimizing what trans America saying but what I'm wanting to people to\nWhat I what I Want people to start thinking about\nIs that you know when we were kids we used to love to play with pendulum and you know we had pendulum ... the one with the little metal thing we'd like about six or seven\nLittle metal balls that you know you know which one I'm Talking about right on your on your desk yeah right so I was talking about pendulum either because the analogy goes when the market's going up the pendulum swinging one way and you know and everybody's making money everybody's happy the real estate prices going up and all that\nBut when the pendulum starts ringing the other way\nAnd the more people I talked to are more concerned because the markets are hitting new highs\nAnd what happens what is your strategy if it goes the other way\nAnd if you're taking more risk than you should or if you do not have a strategy\nTo deal with the next market correction what's going to happen to let's talk about the fifty one percent of people that are feeling very confident that they have a strong mistake when the pendulum goes the other way and if they're not prepared to step out of the way they're going to that pendulum going to basically turn into a wrecking ball\nGoing through their portfolio Mm and you know like every market conditions that we've had you know like every market correction W hat not only A People's investment accounts had lost about fifty percent of the value of the account\nBut on the other hand you know people that own real estate such as primary home or rental properties are the real estate investments\nAll those properties or down about half\nSo overnight you wake up and you were half what you were ... wow you know Kevin said in it is devastating and I think you know if anybody knows\nAnyone that was thinking about retirement back in Nineteen Ninety nine two thousand two thousand one or also a again and it was seven or eight if they're planning a retiring or they're retired\nAnd they have to depend on that money for as part of their retirement income retirement pot and if they will continue taking the money out are based on their lifestyle they are sure to run out of money so preservation\nRisk is good risk is healthy but preservation strategies are extremely important in any kind of planning to to figure out that\nBut if you call in to the radio show and you could do this anytime but if you call it to the radio show my numbers nine to a two to six eight to five five\nIt's nine to eight two to six talk and I will give you this book for absolutely free\nAnd one thing I'll ask you to do is once you read the book I Would love for you to pass it on to somebody else they could benefit from that so it's my gift to you\nAnd your gift to somebody else because I think if we can all kinds of seeing choir sheet and keep more money for ourselves that's what we want to do you know government will always make more money because they're all those people out there making all this tax mistakes and let them pay the taxes\nWe shouldn't packing today with a guy made sure he has owner and founder of for a financial group that phone number one more time they seem that said\nNine to ... inches thick eighty two fifty five or nine to ... to sex talk ... worse than other things need to think about when we are looking at our tax situation and the taxes we might be facing in retirement\nBecause one of the things I talked earlier in the show was required minimum distribution mhm so are empty a requirement distribution comes with significant amount of penalties for not taking enough money out of that plan so for example most people think that you have to be Seventy in half and you have what's called a mandatory distribution\nBut one of the things I'm also starting to see is that people are inheriting money\nFrom their sibling from their friends from their parents and what they're doing is they're inheriting retirement accounts\nAnd if you inherit an IRA and you could do two things one cash without pay the tax will be done with it\nBut most people are going to do that if it's a large chunk of money because that's a pretty significant tax right\nMhm yeah well you should be doing is making that an inherited IRA meaning that the Irish stays a as an IRA but what you're supposed to do is take out what's referred to as a required\nMinimum distribution for inherited the IRA and winning inherit that IRA you regardless your age so you could be Fifteen Years old\nYou inherit an IRA from a parent or grandparent you're supposed to take out a distribution out of that I write in your Fifteen Years old and if you don't just want I don't know big penalty\nSydney now yeah I could you not there is a fifty percent penalty on the monies that you did not take out of the fifties or not they fall euro fifty correct Pfizer fifty\nSo you know because most people are taught that you cannot take any money out of the IRA account until you're fifty nine and a half years old\nAnd you know so what happens with inherited I read I just I I the reason I tell you all those stories are on the show is because this is actually stuff that I've seen happen\nAnd so what happens here is if you don't take money out you have a fifty percent penalty retirement accounts ... when you turned Seventy and a half and so if you have your own retirement account not inherited but your own retirement account and and when he turned Seventy and a half\nYou're supposed to take a distribution ah from eight Seventy and half\nAnd moving for for the rest of your life\nSo let's talk about you this you know we talked about the powers your book\nSo what happens is that most Americans haven't thought this thing that far out\nSo what happens is when you get when you retire let's say you're getting a income from Social Security and you just happened to be one of the lucky people that actually also has pension and that's enough money for you to last you know to live off of\nAnd ... Seventy and a half and the government says Gen you have to take more money out of this plan mhm and so you\nDo you're required minimum distribution like I said if you don't you pay the rent is there any way right you can do it right and as you get older what happens you life expectancy get shorter and as a life expectancy you know according to the chart get shorter meaning the\nGovernment wants to take more and more and more money out of your retirement account so what is the end result the end result is that not only you're having to deplete your retirement account but you're getting pushed into a higher tax bracket number one\nAnd the second thing is that unknowingly\nYou're making ... you know what what happens is your Social Security benefits or the way the tax shark works that almost eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits will become taxable if it's not today so you're going to get pushed into higher tax bracket\nAnd especially with trillions of dollars in debt we have government's going to raise our taxes it's inevitable\nSo if you're concerned\nAbout taxes and you're concerned about Social Security you're concerned about potentially avoiding penalties are

there was a a ... market correction and it wasn't that significant and I remember\nI was in high school and one of my buddies came up to me and said it's Black Friday I'm like I don't know what I mean but oh hey and he goes you know the stock market crash you know we had a big crash and market and I was like okay you know like I mean like a teenage\nMira Hi yeah you're in high school yeah yeah it's like I I wasn't into it and you have today's kids are a lot more ... a smarter more knowledgeable about things that I Would say I was back in the day because you know we were in a different point during ... and technology wasn't as you know available and so forth so it ended up\nThat I didn't think anything of it and from that market correction we also had a significant melt down with the savings and loans ... resolution trust corporation all that and you know my mother was a a business owner in this wonderful terribly Kingman, Arizona\nAnd she had bought choose a little hotel business

ended up happening is my mom just drug this thing out and bled financially to death and you know and and I hear the stories similar story of people in two thousand seven two thousand and eight you know they bought real estate because real estate was the place to put money\nAnd they bought a home and they bought a second home and they you know the flipping houses and this and that you know I
