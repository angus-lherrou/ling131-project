the building and we have a bunch of millennials that come on the show and to the debt free scream\nSo I've become a big fan of millennials um because the millennials who get it get it at a completely different level than other generations have they get on fire for something there on fire for something\nOnce they attach themselves to a cause they will run through a brick wall and so the sharp millennials are the sharpest obscene and I don't know when the dog millennials are the dumbest humans obscene and I don't know when the most shiftless participation trophy living in your mother's basement group I've ever seen\nAnd the good news about millennials is they're really only two guns fabulous and socks\nAnd there is a bunch of 'em that are fabulous and so I don't know why I decided to take up the cause of bragging millennials I think it's because there's a group of people my age and in the media\nAnd so I don't know why I decided to take up the cause of bragging on millennials I

is\nLiving in their mother's basement collecting participation trophy is it's just not true\nThere's a group of them that are but there's a group of them that are freaking rock stars too and so you

and married but we do not have any children should we get long term care at fifty since we don't have any kids to help us or wait until sixty wait until sixty\nThe probability of staying in a nursing home prior to age sixty is less than one percent so much less than one percent it approaches zero\nBut once you're sixty it goes up every single minute [laughter] it's very weird so I highly recommend long term care insurance for nursing home insurance or in home care insurance which you're sixty because Seventy five percent of the ladies will outlive your husband's so the typical scenario is\nThat papa goes in the nursing home\nFifty Seventy five thousand bucks a year corrections scrambles the three hundred thousand dollar mistake dies leave mama broke\nThat's a normal scenario at a decent retirement going end of the scenario\nLittle bit of a nest egg there but it's all gone and nursing homes are not evil they're just I have to be paid to operate the people that work there actually want to feed their kids so they need money called payroll\nSo they're not evil and they're not ripping people off at home mom wanted to go to New Jersey whom actually and I don't want my money go to a restaurant even though I eat there well that's dumb donate their then\nBut if you're going to need in home care or care in a nursing home you need to pay for it and long term care insurance was absolutely a vital part of financial planning but not until you're sixty when your kids are not J. D. is with us in Sacramento, California Hi J. D. how are you\nA Dave I'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up in your world\nThanks for taking my call and I'm calling with a question about mortgages my um my wife and I are debt free and we got eighty three eight I'm working on three B. and we just went through a few we coordinated it\nThank you and yeah and my ...\nWhen the ten percent\nI hear you on your show the twenty percent you'd prefer a hundred percent but if we can't get there than them one of those too so I'm just wondering what what makes the difference between ten and twenty percent\nA good really really good question well like you said obviously a hundred percent down is our favorite mortgage\nOkay not one All right uh the end when somebody's buying a second home I pretty much slap my fist on the table and so I don't buy a house and lecturing and put down twenty percent on your second because you've got the equity coming out of the first one\nRight in a normal scenario on a first home it's okay to whatever you can put down and get into the house okay here's the reason twenty percent is advantageous if you put twenty percent down you have what's called the eighty percent loan\nDown and get into the house okay here's the reason twenty percent is advantageous\nIf you put twenty percent down you have what's called an eighty percent loan that are eighty percent loan to value ratio that allows you with a standard Fannie Mae conventional loan or for that matter with an F. ha loan to have no P. M. I. P. M. I. bands for private mortgage insurance\nWhich basically is insurance that pays the mortgage company money if they foreclose on un lose money on the foreclosure\nThere's ... so it hasn't zero benefit to you under any circumstance it's only because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the ratio you see what I'm saying\nOkay at ... pm my insurance is about Seventy five dollars plus or minus a month per one hundred thousand borrowed\nSo you were a couple of hundred thousand dollar mortgage you got a hundred and fifty to two hundred bucks a month NPR mile alone if you don't put down twenty percent so that's why we push people towards twenty percent but if you're on your first time home twenty percent can be a big difference\nVersus ten percent and so if you buy a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payments no more than a fourth of your take home pay with ten percent down you get your mind on your first time that's not the end of the world and you can get rid of the P. M. I. when you pay the loans down to eighty percent of value\nBy buying an appraisal that the mortgage from an appraiser that the mortgage company ... of\nAnd then they will drop the PM I later after you get it pay down\nThe fact that we're in fact in California where home prices are no fairly high compared to this country make any difference\nYou know it doesn't make any difference is still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just 'cause you're in California and they don't like okay I don't want your map doesn't count\nYou know we don't do that so you still gotta use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're at the higher the whole process market you're in the more difficult this discussion because I wanted to get all the way down to ... percent\nI'm not requiring twenty percent but you get ... you get J. D. how it's much to your advantage\nTo not have that stay that way I Am I\nYeah I mean because you are talking about three or four hundred thousand dollar loan I mean we're talking about some money per month to going out the window for insurance that's worth absolutely zero to you\nRight so that's what I'm trying to avoid here but it's not but so if you buy and you don't put down twenty percent didn't keep jumping on that mortgage keep working your baby steps four five six simultaneous get that mortgage pay down and get that loan reset\nWith an appraiser plant that's approved and then get that PM I drop so you're not doing enough for Twenty years\nDoes it just sucks it's just a horrible you know it's just but it's part of the race and it's a it's a logical reason that they require it but it's just super expensive\nAnd it just as bad so you want to get out of it as soon as you can because then you get to the business are really paying on your mortgage and not just wasted money but yeah I I you know we don't beat up on a first time homebuyer doing baby step three B. for not putting down twenty percent\nUh the goal always\nIs to become a hundred percent that free as fast as we can and not waste any money we don't have to waste that's what we that's the goal we all have\nWell those of us that are in tune with being smart anyway\nNick is with us in Chattanooga Hi Nick welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave it's good to talk to you you too man what's up okay so I'm twenty\nFive I uh I have I've done pretty well for myself or I have a dilemma though my ... he'll as cars have a car it's a a a two thousand nine class or three hundred bucks to ask thirty eight\nModel what the big game in it and it's a be a top yes I paid\nWell below Kelley Blue book value and I have about five to six thousand dollars worth of equity in the car mhm and I've been listening you go through your baby steps it's\nGoing to be tough for me but I think I Need to sell the car I Know you're going to tell me to sell the car and use the money to finish my merged based on\nWhat is your and what is your car worth\nA private market is twenty three who I think\nAnd and you said you're twenty five and you're doing pretty well for yourself tell me what that means\nThat means I have a good job of got Twenty one thousand dollars best retirement or have no credit card debt\nMhm no I was like are you single I'm Single and what's your income\nMy income is about forty five fifty thousand dollars a year give or take a little bit with overtime\nIs this your only dead on the car that smell like that and how much do you owe on it\n[noise] ah oh sixteen thousand two hundred and fifty two dollars and Twenty one steps\nAs a single guy can't you pay that in a year\nOr maybe you have no life but you get to keep the car no life you don't see the inside of a freaking restaurant unless you're working there\nI've been doing that Dave out of the ... yeah I can I mean I've been doing everything and that\nBut can't I mean can you can probably pay sixteen thousand a year making fifty grand if you're single ...\nYes sir I keep the car\n\nOkay let me tell you how to let me tell you how do they tell us it's just not how much you love the car or a little card is although both are valid because it as a seriously cool car\nBut the analysis is this can you be debt free except your house and under two years the answer's yes and all your vehicle's the total of all your vehicles worth less less than half of your annual income and the answer is fairly yes and you really love the song\nSo you're willing to fight for the thing I don't have more than half their annual income of the stuff that goes on ... that's from one car guy to another caller guy okay I got lots of cars that are less than one percent them I'm at work they just have always go get some money for\nAnd then you can have a choice this is that I ...

have a Nineteen year old I'm I'm a crime that my son's best on living with her he makes about it clearer Eighteen hundred a month and he has a car payment to twenty to help on what should about eighty bucks and for gas about a hundred bucks\nBudget for the month um we're just trying to figure out we got him on a number of countries live with a real fast as his wallet was basically his bank account he has no bank account yet\nI'm what I wanted to know is how do we kind of go along and do the envelope system was budgeting has money and putting money away and try and figure out what to do with all his actor\nOkay well I think you did you do a budget and that's where every dollar has a name before the month begins right yeah it sounds like it's a fairly primitive easy budget\nYeah there's not much that there are a mail like Thirteen hundred dollars only are\nYou know let's get the car paid off and build up an emergency fund and go that route I'm that'll make sense but but um\nYou know we're teaching these basic things that you and I both know about apparently you been doing the stuff that we talk about for a while and yeah we're going we're going to be on a budget we're going to avoid that we're going to build up in emergency savings and begin long term investing\nAlready we're going to be generous with some of the money and a show the whole thing that you get when you got someone that's living in a fairly primitive situation like this meeting no bank account\nYou know he's a young young guy getting started is that ah it's real easy for all that money to just disappear\nYeah and the egg thing you've got to get him doing is being intentional with every\nDollar okay I'm a I'm I'm a little juice suggests we start out with\nUm I well I get a bank account going like you're talking about on a debit card for that and then you know I I think you just lay it out and say okay you know where do you want to be in five years in what other steps that are going to get you there and so you know how much are you going to spend on entertainment\nOkay how much are you going to spend on what's your take to keep your car running gas wise and your insurance and your car payments\nOr ... or ... how much are you going to spend on what's your take to keep your car running gas wise\nAnd your insurance and your car payment and then you take this income and give every dollar a name right down the page I mean this is a one page budget you can do in about eight minutes you know yeah there's not there's not a lot to this deal is not like it's complicated\nOkay yeah we got some level of set up for like um a merger Soufan and the ... like a car like emergency fondness for you and your car stuff yeah I mean these things we do have said in his corner about ten percent of the marine home we put in your savings Warren\nOkay well no I I Would I Would work the baby steps I mean that's sort of cows in dollars aside as my margins refund and then after that I got his car paid off and then after that I have a fully funded emergency fond of three to six months of expenses in his case he be rich if he had no debt and five ... five grand and savings wasn't it\nYeah it'd be really well off so\nOkay well then I Would start is investing long term start talking about a Roth IRA and those kinds of things that he would start talking about maybe some additional savings so he can have his own blush\nOkay thank you very much hey thank you for calling it appreciate your joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Vicky is with us in Wilmington North Carolina\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I have a question about an inheritance [laughter] um my husband and I are small business owners and we have a significant amount of debt with the business and our personnel which is a lot to the business for ... years during the recession and uh several years ago\nAnd we have a twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance that we [noise] um [noise] my husband had hope that we could\nUse for the kids' college I have one daughter that's in her freshman year of college now and another one that will be starting next fall and then two other teenagers and the baby say I'm\nSo this business of making money\nIt's struggling it makes many now but we still have a good bit of debt from much as it might profit\nUm profit [noise] uh [noise]\nGosh probably\nWell I have to say probably it doesn't make enough to support us over the past few years but I'm\nGoing to live in this mythology\n[laughter] um\nI don't know we every time he has said okay I Need to go find a job from there it's like that door closes and the business [noise] door stays open and um\nHave business doors not open it's not making enough to support your family and so we need to sit down on this business and give it a deadline that in the next six months it's going to start\nSupporting our family after all these years and making enough to start getting rid of some of this debt or we're going to close it\nAnd get a job because I don't think you're making any money\nUm am I wrong [noise] well\nI mean we pay ourselves and the business and when I was bringing home about a hundred thousand a year\nBringing out you're you're taking a hundred thousand dollars out of business yep well that'd be called profit okay you can't live on a hundred thousand dollars\nWell we can we had a lot of how much data God Forbid that this guy about fifty two K. and we personally have about um Ninety six K ...\nWere you in the business doesn't have any debt you son personally for it OK so at all is that I learned that it's dollars in debt and you have a hundred and you have a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt and you make a hundred thousand dollars a year is that all you makes a hundred thousand or the that's what you're pulling out and then you make a profit to\nNow that's all we make that's what I mean\nWe are happening all income when you do your taxes\nIs right Kay it has banned that were made with an account to adjust something there that were taken distribution of standing all profit and that doesn't change it right but that's how much we're ... we're paying ourselves from the business ... a year so you need to find out if you don't know what can\nYou get back you give me three different answers so you need to find out if it if you make if your business is making a hundred thousand dollars a year and you guys can't live on who doesn't know if you've got other problems\nRight yeah\nAnd you can pay off that making a hundred thousand dollars a year and work your way through it and know the twenty nine thousand dollars does not need to go the kids' college fund it needs to go clean up his dad gummed ... what might\nOkay but it don't it you're the only way that makes sense is\nIf you have a system in a plan where you actually know if the business is making a profit and if it is making a profit what the property is and it's all coming home to pay off these debts mhm or if you want to pay off if it's two thousand at the business and call that business that I don't care but we need to be reducing debt\nRight quickly and aggressively and if you're making a hundred thousand dollars a year younger people do that but you guys aren't living on a plan the business is not on a plan on your personal lives on a plan I can tell by talking to you\nYeah I Know and we just got F ... in the mail today and we started okay\nThat's a good start ... and I'm going to send you a copy of the book entree leadership on the business side so\nBut because here's the thing you need to be going no no I'm not going to quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great business\nYou know I'm not going to quit that but what we are saying then is is that we can get fined tune in give I think you're good at making money I don't think you're as good at managing it\nAnd so we need to fine tune our systems at the business the profit and loss statements the budget set the business and so we know exactly\nWhere every dollar at the business is going and exactly where it's coming from and then exactly what's coming home and what is taxable income\nAnd then lay out a game plan to pay off a hundred and forty two thousand dollars worth of that\nBetween these two different sets of that\nAnd work your way through it you can do both and use the twenty nine thousand towards that go if you don't do that and you throw the twenty nine thousand that the goal and then you never pay off the debt it was kind of wasted wasn't it so I'm not asking you to blindly throw it at the ... the debt and throwing a system that your business in the system\nIn detail budget at your home and all of that applied directly on this problem so the problem goes away\nAnd this went on thousands part of the solution to that but the biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized with the money at home and at work hold on I'm going to give me a copy of the book entree leadership and this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay things are getting really weird out there I thought the Equifax breach was bad enough it exposes the personal financial info of half\nAnd things that you'd want and just waiting on them yeah\nIn fact for me I Would say it's just you know everybody's different in the way they approach a this debt free journey like Lindsey over here she's mixed failed guru in geek in loves to see a split out\nI'm a put a thermometer up there and let me hold her in the whole thing and get me to the top oh man I go more goals driven in that we do about it I'm going to\nWrite but on the refrigerator right when we were on the refrigerator so that everybody can see that we're in that it's kinda like you know when you're an alcoholic you go to Alcoholics Anonymous now this was it it was like hey we're the ... were in debt\nI Am not I don't know it's our way of being honest in a in a fry and letting people see kind of be a part of our journey if they enter a home\nSo that people look at you look curiously or like you were crazy or did you get more cheerleaders\nNo as a little bit of both I mean our family is very supportive but for me the crazy part was that it was weird I I kind of took it took my blinders off and realize that a lot of people are OK with with being in debt and taking on that and I'm like\nWhy you know like when we got to this or not get it in the beginning but people kept saying oh no just just go by that you know you know you can paid off soon\nNo no no that's not how I Wonder also right and you know obviously with with our little guy here in in our next one coming up for a little girl oh it was like you know it's now or never in the best times now when they're cheaper um and then you know once again as far as the next census oh yeah we have done\nTo exactly wrong well done you got ... very well done that's fun and so little guy came with you how old is he he's two years old and his name is eastern Carter Carol okay so this eastern due to free screamed a\nHitler used by cell but he may be a little shy but we'll see he's got he's got his back whoa actually in his mouth right now they're back has been driving around and like I did a good thing\nFor ... or for worse right fun they can do it right that's exactly well congratulations you guys we've got a copy of Chris ... book for ... inspired and that is the next chapter in your story for you to be millionaire strikes and outrageously generous along the way so fun stuff Iraq\nAll right Brenda and Lindsay and eastern from Los Angeles area thirty thousand dollars paid off and Thirteen months making one thirty to one fifty counted down a debt free screamer right three two one\n\nOpen phones AAA eight to five five two to five you jumping and we'll talk about your life and your money Dale is with us in Kansas City Hi Dale how are you\nCalling for taking my call but I sure what's up\n[noise] [noise] well I'm Wondering if I Need more life insurance but I have okay how much do you have a have a two hundred and fifty thousand\nOkay what's your household income sorry what's your household income a hundred and eighty what\nDo you make a hundred and fifty okay\nAnd you have two hundred and fifty in life insurance and how much in your nest egg do you have and wealth um investments\nAre more debt free of them home and land mhm and that's worth about one point eight mhm and then I have about four hundred thousand and four ones and Ross\nOkay good and uh what do you owe on the land and home\nA five hundred and twenty okay All right\nWell the income produced off of six hundred and fifty thousand dollars less just use it that's the two fifty and the four hundred\nYou got those two numbers mhm if those two were invested in just rent round numbers just to make this easier if it was ten percent that'd be sixty five thousand dollars a year she doesn't get to keep the land in the house and the scenario does she\nNo\nShe can't for service for half a million dollar debt with a sixty five thousand our income and raise kids right\nYes okay so you're under insured if your goal was for her to stay in that property upon your debt now if she'd liquidated input seven hundred thousand\nThe equity of that Boswell two hundred thousand dollar house has five hundred in her hand plus has two fifty plus has four hundred now she's got over a million dollar she's got paid for two hundred thousand dollar house and she can live on a hundred thousand dollars a year then coming off of a million one that makes sense\nSo if that's your plan you're okay but if you want her to stay on that property and continue to live there you don't have enough insurance to see how I'm doing that\nYes earlier okay so what's the goal which one\n\nWould you want her to stay on William I want her to stay on the way over she wants to stay on the land but I Would rather she would move close with us from family okay\nIf you if you want the ability to do that we need 'em\nThen if if you if you want the ability to do that we need um [noise] you know you need about a million five and insurance\nShould use five hundred of them have to pay off the property she'd have a million dollars and some change that way to live off the income from so somewhere a million million five and life insurance or your seven fifty light at least be able to hit that using the simple numbers I was using their [noise]\n\nWhat if you could help people

quoting when I say the my grand caravan that\nStarted off in Honduras with about two thousand people has now doubled to five thousand and as of this morning there are now just over seven thousand people wake making their way north to the U.S border the line of people when they're not writing in the back of several mysteriously paid for trucks\nStretches out for over a mile\nNow I err quoted migrant and the caravan for a reason\nIt's not a caravan when's the last time you saw more than seven thousand people marching towards another country's border and carrying their own flag\nMore than seven thousand people marching towards another country's border and carrying their own flag\nAnd\nMay have through most of us would say never unless you served in the military and you were invading\nIt's not a caravan there is no other way to describe this then invasion\nAs I've said before this is a Honduran political stunt it was organized by a leftist Marxist group has ties to the former Marxist president who was exiled after a coup in two thousand nine\nThese people never got over it and they've been doing political stunts ever since to make the current right wing government look bad\nThe organizers of this invasion have ties to the Castros in Cuba and the door oh in Venezuela this stunt is designed for media fallout and it is time to very specifically for maximum exposure\nEarly voting for the midterms has already been done by the time they reach the U.S border you will only see two things on cable news the election polls and the status at the border\nSo what do we do\nIf the caravan is stopped in Mexico this could help the GOP come November six what's a greater example of why we need stricter border policies or even a wall after seeing this play out\nMexican immigration officers were completely overwhelmed when the caravan first crossed into Mexico they could only process about six hundred people before the remaining five thousand just pushed\nThrough some on land some just waded across the water\n... invasion caravans are new norm what choice do you have other than to build the wall\nBut let's say the caravan does reach our border every single media camera will be pointed not at the migrants but at the national guard and the U.S border patrol dressed\nAnd it's a massive turnout massive turnout uh if the the red parts of the state does actually turned out this state could be in big trouble because it is a massive\nTurnout is there any thought a with a caravan of just learning from our friends to the south and what we do is we just let people come in and we just kinda guide them until they get all the way to Canada and they're walking north they'd never that necessarily they're stopping here\nA candidate beautiful this kind of your time of year we didn't kind of it's kind of walk on the side of the streets and just kind of having them\nAnd we would if it was going to Canada and they were protesting Canada\nI think there'll be a lot of people have said just don't cause any Trump just let him go to Canada I'm sure a lot of people in Mexico are saying that just right just what was not our problem they just want to go to America just not a problem well it is your problem and if Mexico Canada would say to us you stop this or we're not going to trade with you we zero eight to ... like they give us any aid\nZero zero cheese whatever it is\nWe're not giving you any of\nThat as a good neighbor we would stop it\nWe need to be very clear no aid for Mexico none I Know the president said that about Honduras Guatemala and I hope he backs that up cut that aid off right now\nOf Mexico withheld case though I Would just open the borders right now I Would just open\nThem up to ... anybody you know to

midterms remember they were shooting the fact I have video of it today they're doing it again they're not shooting from behind so you don't see the crowd\nAnd Obama is out and he's in you know these these rooms that are like four hundred people maybe ... maybe tops two thousand\nAnd they're shooting it so it looks like a big crowd but it's not they did that in the midterms 'cause he's crowds went away here we are at the midterms and Donald Trump still has these gigantic crowds\nAnd and listen to what can we played Sarah the audio that was played on the loudspeakers outside of the rally last

Ted Cruz I Would be a little concerned um because it was an overwhelming response from Texas where Texans I thought were a little\nUm [noise] I don't know calm about this election and it didn't really realize how much money Soros and others have poured in to make this a blue wave here in Texas more than any other Senate candidate for any quarter and history thirty eight million dollars for Beto just for him that's not all that land\nThat's not including the ... money that is going into this state outside a pack of money and tons of that um so we're going to talk to the uh Governor Greg Abbott we're going to talk to him a little bit about the caravan and also about what's happening\nMillions of dollars into this state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing and so many of your listeners need to understand this is George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles are two years ago he gave a half a million dollars\nNot directly to a candidate in Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that has funded these ground games to get out the vote\nAnd so he is trying to turn Texas a into California and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for Canada's like that so uh but let's go back to the first part of your questions and listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really blew cities in blue counties you have\nA Dallas year after year and you have San Antonio you have all that and you had to El Paso\nAnd so you have these massive blue regions across the state of Texas that makes it so much harder for people who are conservative people\nAre who are Republican to be able to cobble together the votes that are needed to make sure that we keep Texas the passion of freedom that back to the liberty or in the past year the conservatism and so uh every vote counts in and we really need to get people excited enthusiastic about this the same way they were\nAh it last night where we were from Texas I'm I'm Sorry what people are fired up and they are ready but we need people to go vote\nTell me a little bit about the caravan is there do we have any idea other than the you know political leanings of this group or when it was back in Honduras\nDo we have any idea just the logistics who is behind this and what we're prepared to do\nSir I've had the opportunity to speak with both the secretary of homeland security as well as the president about this and I I can\nTell you what I can tell you publicly and and that is or if you think these are people who are leaving Honduras Guatemala or wherever that coming from\nOr just trying to escape violence and income seek asylum or that is incorrect or this is very well organized it's funded has a there are there are others who are behind it and very importantly\nA end this caravan are not just people from Honduras Guatemala a we know that some of the leaders of it are are involved in their midst Thirteen we don't we know that some of the people in it are from\nCountries across the entire globe are there are what we use in the in the lingo ... which are a special interest aliens who posed a a very real dangerous threat or to the security of the United states of America who are in bed at these caravans\nRight ... Univision just reported this morning that there were people with terrorists ties ah from Malaysia involved and imbedded in this\nAnd and I've heard the same thing with ... with regard to ah terrorists coming from countries other than Malaysia and I'm thinking about this if these people really were trying to escape by work life on whatever group but they're coming from\nWhy is it that they are marching with the flag of the country that they're coming from mhm you know they they they are not\nComing to the United states of America to make the United states of America a better place they're not coming to the United states to exclude a ... style I'm from the dangerous they have in fact there were multiple reports on TV last night and he came up with a showing\nOf the interviews with these people in the Caribbean and they were talking about what was their strategy or when they get us and they said it's very simple and those are numbers\nAre overwhelm the United states' ability or to uh go through the salad process for all these people so they they have been taught him know already that\nTheir strategy is to basically rushed the game so much that the U.S loses ... let me tell you something if we lose control of our border they released lose control of our sovereignty\nWe're no longer a sovereign nation and we must step up and use every tool that we can to make sure that we put an end to this care and because I understand this clean also and that is this maybe two or three or five thousand people but they make it in right\nBehind them in the air out of twenty thousand people behind that will be a caravan of fifty thousand people and the United states of America as we know it will be forever altered who don't do something to stop this\nYou know the press is going to treat us like the Israelis and the caravan like the Palestinians um is the president leaning on the president of Mexico and\nThreatening to cut off all I mean if I mean I think this is the time to really lean hard and say this is not our problem turn them around or we'll cut off all aid with with Mexico is there a chance of this\nOr that the president has been outspoken about cutting off aid to Honduras and brought them out\nRight now the uh the United states is working collaboratively in in in this might be hard to believe so I Want to emphasize that\nUh the u._s. is working collaboratively with Mexico Mexico has made a decision that they have not made in the past Mexico is working with the United nations or to try to work on a temporary settlement of these care band members in Mexico\nElm in so nice Mexico's is is actually playing a ... a very beneficial goal in this whole process with us right now and we applaud Mexico for what they're doing\nIt was is is actually playing a very beneficial goal and this whole process with us right now and we applaud Mexico for what they're doing or at least as of this moment of time\nOr they headed towards the Texas no no invasion plans of the United states with the former Soviet Union ever included Texas because they knew Texans would not take kindly to the invasion force or they headed towards a Lexus or California\nI Will tell you what are what was reported publicly last night and I will not disputed and and that is a early on before yesterday on there was great concern that they were headed for Texas and it was reported last night that they are headed toward\nCalifornia now that makes sense because as you know California is a science or a state yeah and and ... they were welcomed this caravan and Tim or

didn't have a very good year in twenty sixteen but he had predicted both of Obama's victories I'm Scott Rasmussen was the closest pollster John McLaughlin was the other coast poster in twenty uh sixteen and he says there's an eighty six percent chance the Democrats take over the house\nEighty two percent chance that Republicans picked up seats in the Senate I don't have a feel on the house but I Do believe\nRepublicans could actually win Florida Tennessee\nMissouri Nevada Arizona for shore North Dakota for sure maybe Montana and if they didn't have a libertarian in Indiana they win that race for sure but they've got a good shot beating Joe Donnelly in Indiana if people don't vote libertarian I'm On the house side it's very hard to get a feel forty retirements doesn't make it any easier\n... that's right but I think eighty eighty percent way too high and a little surprised the sober for the second cycle road going for a limb I'm most recent survey indicates that in fact\nYou have 'em in the very closely contested districts and this was an NBC survey um that they actually are were within about two points on the generic ballot\nWell if if the contest districts out we're losing the Democratic districts very badly we're also not so much money and then we're not campaigning in them we're not making our case a but but in the swing seats that matter\nA we actually are basically tied on the generic ballot\nIn and all I can tell you is\nI I look at the issues that are going to matter ... things happening you see this a little bit with Stacey Abrams uh in in Georgia the candidate for governor who explained today that she's opposed to free enterprise and health care because she she hates making a profit and you never do any good if you make a profit um\nAnd and she is just very left wing cinema the Democrat in in Arizona for US Senate\nRefuses to apologize for urging Americans to saying it's okay for Americans to join the Taliban um what's happened in Minnesota now where I think you tell us and may drag down the entire chicken except for any closure they may lose a Senate seat house seats the governorship\nA because Keith Ellison is just so totally left wing and unacceptable and so I keep looking around at these patterns and uh I think what you're seeing is a remarkable moment where\nThe ... for example\nWhen we were talking about ten days ago you and I were that this was a race between jobs and marched well if you look at the pictures coming out of Mexico right now you couldn't get a better picture of a mob and if you watch the Democrats\nThe way events in our in the debate has moved I think there's been a dramatic shift for certainly in the cabinet case you know it's amazing to watch how the you know the the other news channels are covering the president's speech last night\nOr the president actually fake news CNN actually says president wise price to gin up division\nAnd they've never covered what Maxine Waters has been saying\nThey've never recovered a single thing of her saying you know create a crowd followed them in a grocery stores follow them into a department store the gas station then you tell them then I Want to hear anywhere anymore or what's happened to Pam Bondi or secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders a Ted Cruz and now Mitch McConnell and Henry Kissinger and\nYou know obviously this is the mob mentality is coming from the left nor do I see Mr Speaker nor can I say or\nOr elaborate on any one issue or program they're offering\nThat will help the lives of the American people not one that's not what they're running on\nYou know I look I I well they do run on\nA government run health care for everybody which they can't defend which which when you examine that collapses because is totally unsustainable financially and will be a nightmare to try to implement that's the closest thing to come to a big idea and it's a really bad idea\nI agree totally All right um we'll be checking in regularly fourteen days to go or do you believe the admission by this Georgia gubernatorial candidate that she burned the state flag or is that going to change that race now\nWell I don't think that that doesn't change the race for the totality of her being a radical the fact that the organization she headed up may have filed twenty three thousand falls voting registrations for people who don't exist I mean I think the more we learn about the more trouble she gets to be\nAll right but I appreciate it thank you so much a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich let's get to our phones here

Senate We're gonna come close and we don't when they need to keep it and I think as the pastor Scott ... said\nThere's so many a minority voters out there who are going to come around the Trump expand that opportunity he's not a racist he's opening opportunities for all people including black and I'm telling you liberals can't stand is\nA ... and the other people who were defecting from their

they're seven and be miserable uh but but they want to take their kids go out to eat and not have to worry about a pastor I mean we all want the same things that this is universal listed humanity\nYes it is I really believe these next fourteen days is going to be critical for messaging as long as I'm missing stays consistent\nShe's one of the largest Nancy Pelosi donors ah she's against the tax cuts and JOBS Act she's getting a lot of outside money from pillows he's packed Tom ... the peach Trump guy a from a bomb a superPAC that's come all that money is flooding and right here to the middle of North Carolina so it's a tough fight one that we can win but it's definitely a clear contrast you know\nBoth the cook Political Report an odds maker Nate Silver and tightened their assessment of this race or and the cook report actually listed this is North Carolina what you can explain the exact areas are that are going to be impacted by by this\nUm this district anyway is among the five congressional districts across\nThe country that it said had shifted more\nTowards democratic candidates and yours is gonna be a a bellwether district and you're going to come in I think your polls closed what seven thirty but I remember correctly on election night\nOr they do and so we're going to fight all the way through the end\nAh look this is a district that goes from Greensboro down to solve very over to mores of ill ah this is a this is a great\nA district but it is one of the topics toughest districts and the state is if you look at those numbers it's an are six or so it is a real fight we knew this a twenty two months ago when I was sworn in that this would be a a a fight for the foundation for who gets the speaker's gavel\nIn twenty Eighteen and voted it come true now it seems like people are waking up\nVoters are starting to turn out and we're thankful for every single one of these conservative voters that are going to the polls of the few days of early voting but again this is a con harassed race you know for low unemployment ah like we've got growing the economy did I've done what I said I was going to do\nWell you also have the ninth district in in a tight race\nIn mark Harris is on on deck and Trump the president is coming into port me and mark Harris both uh this coming friday night and so\nLooking forward to mark here as a winning be serving with him he's a great guy I've known him for over two decades or so look forward to him winning and serving right alongside them\nWell this is an important race if you're in the thirteenth congressional district in you're in North Carolina including what much of high point or Greensboro all Davidson David counties of um parts of Rhone counties and and some others you know this is a big raise this is going to be a bellwether race our election\nCounties well exactly thank you so much\nAlright thank you we wish you the best thing so much for being with US Congressman Ted but that's an important or race or let's get to our phones Patty isn't but that is the Maryland Patty how are you\n[laughter] I'm doing great how are you shine I'm good thank you glad you called\nYeah you know I'm I just wish I believe in ... I Believe in what he's saying I Believe in what you're saying you cannot let that night and then and now it's ridiculous it's out of control but\nIt's all about the whole coordinated effort and showing it so that the Democrat crack can't play their same game as\nYou know of course the ... you know with the way they're using all of their their word she feel sympathy and build next trust against the Republicans and\nTrumpet so good at that he's just got to make sure again as a coordinated effort said that there is a theme that people there and the military show of force start sending buses start sending plane all staged they're ready to say lean mean that\nThis is his reading mine and the sad just like Obama had with Syria he didn't do that this is trying to do that and he's got to show it is and and handling is right with a really great where it needed Africa\nI'm really not worry yeah of course I Do I mean we don't want a humanitarian crisis you know the vice president actually said today that\nYou know a Central American leaders told him that left us in Venezuela are bankrolling this caravan which wouldn't surprise me the Honduran ... president telling the vice president that and ... told the Washington Post the president of on doors told me this was organized by leftist groups in Honduras financed by Venezuela look bottom line is\nThey should be turned back now but\nIf in fact we see they're getting closer and closer to our southern border we've got to protect the border we're going to do this in a way I I Know that is we want to have the best interests of innocent people and all of this nobody's innocent if they're willing to just brush our border Russia across the border we don't want people hurt we definitely don't want people killed\nAnd ultimately the people that will precipitate this crisis they're going to be on the Mexican side of the border\nBecause America is not going to do anything to people that don't violate the law but if they violate the law there'll be arrested and I I hear what you're saying we should have food water medicine supplies\nAnd transportation back to where they came from and I I think you can do it in as as expeditious way possible with them as much terrorists possible\nUm but I don't think any arrest ever looks good and if the people on the Mexican side of the border border want a confrontation with American police and\nAnd our military um\nOur side is going to win and you're right we should do it as passionately as possible I don't want anybody to get hurt you know a lot of these people probably come from nothing they have zero to lose here and that's a that's a tough position to be in and then you have agitator that or you know they're not telling them anything that's on us than truthful that they're they're telling them they're going to get in\nAnd so they're going to be disappointed feelings of anger anger is going to probably be on display\nSo we're just hoping to get it turned around before this even happens but you know let's\nThings in anger anger is going to probably be on display\nSo we're just hoping to get it turned around before this even happens but you know let's let's be clear here\nThis is the United states of America we're constitutional republic we believe in the rule of law\nAnd the application of our laws that's it Democrats don't like it they can change the law good luck to them doing that on this topic which John Podesta says they shouldn't even be talking about right anyway Patty thank you I'm Becky is in Tucson, Arizona next on the Sean Hannity show how are you glad you called Becky\nHi Sharon how are you today I'm good what's going on\nWell I got a couple of things being from the border towns that people don't understand about this is not that kind of [noise]\nYes they come to our daughter but they don't understand that they also come with a lot of diseases like TV and chicken pox in life and our border patrol agents and all are people that are working with get exposed to this\nThey don't understand there's a long term ramifications of them and I had a feeling of thought about why I'm Mexican Government is not stopping some\nMob it's because when they come here and earn money they send millions and millions and millions of dollars back to their family members the wire transfer\nSo why should they stop them because they're making money off so I think we should stop the why are trained first\nLook there is a part of me having been down to where you live in Tucson the Rio Grande everywhere in between and I've been I've I've reported on the border more than anybody else that I Know in media today I've been horseback all terrain vehicle helicopters boats\nI'd been there\nSeen them I was up close and personal when it turned out gang members were being arrested I've got the video of it drug warehouses tunnels I've seen it all look I understand that people come from countries where there's great poverty and little opportunity um but\nThe answer isn't not obeying or laws that we have a an immigration policy immigration laws the first step if you want to ever come to America\nIs to respect the laws of this land and respect America sovereignty and respect our borders and that if you're not willing to do that basic most fundamental of things and then at that point there are other people that would would be willing to accept that\nAnd doing the right way and they should have precedence over those that are law listen don't respect our laws\nSo it's really really simple\nAnd you know I feel listen to the world America had the money you know we do so much already ... tunes of billions and trillions of dollars were spent over the years to help other people in other lands\nAt some point we've got to take care of America First we've got to take Americans out of poverty first we've got Americans that need help in this country that that don't yet have not fully gotten on board we need every American successful and those that can take care of themselves they will be taking care of\nNo Americans never lack for compassion just the opposite there's never been a country that has accumulated more power and used it for the advancement of human good around the world more than the U.S including paying the price and shutting the blood for the cause of liberty and freedom for many people around the world\nUm\nBut it is that we cannot take on the world's problems either we don't have the money we don't have the ability to do that anyway eight hundred\nNine four one showing you want to be a part

yeah\nYeah no it's it's a it's an important source of clean energy which is you know a Tom's dire the lefty billionaire from California that's pushing this prop one to seven wants us to shut down\nAnd uh that's one of the reasons why in addition to getting out and voting for myself Rodney Glassman adjusts and also we need everyone to vote against prop one to seven\nI'm so baffled Rodney that shutting this thing down now what I found out was amazing California gets so much of their electricity from this like you said largest nuclear power plant in the nation's absolutely amazing how much electricity comes out of this thing\nBut I don't think they realize that because they they're basically beyond this dire plan like the plan that's maybe an institution over here in Arizona but they're outsourcing\nTheir dirty energy\nYou know what I'm saying well it's interesting I actually the most most orders I just learned this about uh don't realize is that at certain times of the day because

I've had people say is that what the J there is a segment of the population and I don't know how large it is but there is a lot of folks out there that want to see a change in leadership at ... home them talking about current incumbent mayor core Eleven's who's welcome on the show\nWhen I had not taken up our invitation as of yet\nUm and they were very disappointed also that\nThere was nobody there was nobody to choose from other than you select one it was like I you know human election year one choice right you know what I'm saying and that's frustrated people I think that's why many people have asked me hey gotta get get George Back on\n'em because we want to have a choice and they're frustrated right than really you know as a I have business cards that or I Want to hand out to as many people as possible so that they can carry them into the\nInto the ballot box let them suffer from that guessing or have to remember or memorized my name um but on the back of it really I Do tell people why I'm doing what I'm doing and it really is very simple and that is is\nNo one in our system of government of a free government\nVery simple and that is this no one in our system of government of a free government should ever run on a post and when you know when I tell people that I never had anybody say well I don't agree with you they all agree with me no one should run unopposed\nIf they do that candidate or that incumbent has every right to take that as a ... up from a hundred percent of the population saying you know what I'm doing a good job and in fact I'm going to do more of what I'm doing\nNow that's that's a good point and I think that\nWell I Wonder and I would like to ask the current mayor is that what you're kind of thinking I don't know\nBut yeah why didn't anyone challenge and there were rumors of people doing it but but they did okay but you're here you're the artificial writing Ken and people may not realize this but if you write in a like if you wrote in me for mayor and please don't age does not count because I Would not be an official candidate for mayor you actually have to\nIf someone was if they wrote in a ... you know enough right in to beat the uh the candidate on the ballot\nIt wouldn't count that subject like correct that is that you're the only ... just like just like all the other candidates I had to file papers yes just lower threshold I mean a lot of these candidates they did go out there and it's a lot of signatures\nAnd it's hard to get on a valid and have your name appear on the ballot that is very very tough because of Thirteen hundred plus signatures\nRight um some rumblings that a little bit of discontent out there the fact that I get to be in the election uh without having to go through that process here's the issue my name's on on a ballot\nYou you're not on a much harder for ... it has to be incredibly hard or get 'cause you got to spell right okay I think the criticism I got 'em or at least the last time I had you on the criticism I heard\nWas we didn't get into issues right and you would you just got in the United states you came on I don't even know if you'd officially filed yet it was hey I'm going to do that so we didn't get into she's so we need to get in the ... 'cause I don't have a ton of time\nUm so the best way and what I've been doing with candidates who come in 'em and most have come through proposition florrie see this is the sustainable wages act\nAs you know George the uh wages and flags that have gone up further than in in the rest of the states and you're scheduled to be Fifteen fifty per hour by two thousand twenty two it will be the highest minimum wage in the nation and people are scared people are concerned\nI'm your thoughts on should we slow this down should are you a supporter for a lie\nActually a am a supporter for Eighteen I'm ... and principally here's why government does nothing well in my opinion uh and mandating private industry to raise wages\nOn a schedule entirely defeats the ... the the\nMerit based raises where you take out the ability for people to be rewarded for being a better employee than say the next guy it takes the incentive out of hard work in my opinion\nAnd uh George ... my my guest running as a write in candidate for mayor for Flagstaff and\nUm I've heard from lots of business owners I've gotten more folks coming in tomorrow on this issue um about lower let not lower levels employment but less hours mhm I'm we're seeing the stress I but I don't see the stress the economic stress but I don't think we've witnessed\nThe full stress that we may see coming up regarding this wages should 'cause the economy's doing so well right you see the numbers you see the national numbers President Trump gets little credit for that\nUm and you see the national numbers and that's helping a place like Flagstaff mask some of these bad economic decisions do you think we are headed in a road as a city\nHeaven forbid I don't want another recession but we know these are cyclical things or we set ourselves up for some real bad problems down the road here [noise]\nTo me it's it's really simple businesses have to make a certain amount of money not don't misunderstand there's some there's some businesses out there that can afford to pay more than others that can't afford to pay what say others can um with that said\nIf we continue to cause distance to have to pay more\nThe passing out onto the consumer and they're going to either they're gonna charge more or as you say they're going to reduce ... hours or they're going to cut positions\nWould you have supported a counselor an opportunity to change this and get it on the ballot quicker and now we've had another set of increases what'd you voted to get this on the ballot quicker or to let the people have a quicker decision and and have it on the ballot say earlier in the year versus the general election yeah\nUp probably so uh I I think there's a lot of people out there who even were originally for the wage increase NSA seeing their their salaries go up there not necessarily seeing the buying power that say this was promised to give them\nUm we have many communities in in Arizona\nA Sedona for example I that traffic nightmare\nUh Prescott traffic nightmare Flagstaff traffic nightmare I'm ... and it's getting worse and worse I've been talking a lot recently about any you northern Arizona university and the gross and um they they want to go out to about thirty three thousand students there's twenty something thousand there now\nYou see tremendous pressure on ... avenue court or for example and and now there's talk of any you know they've bought Thirteen million and property who knows what they're going to do with it\nUm is there any way out of these traffic problems there's a couple of proposition is on the ballot they want to do a potentially an overpass downtown over the railroad tracks but it's a huge a price tag a it's a it's a it's a huge price that can do this thing is that really going to solve anything what do we do I mean your mayor\nGoodness gracious I mean no one is is built out to what it is there there's not a whole lot of space out there to to build out on the streets you tear down what we could yeah that's what they're doing yeah\nYeah well then we're putting out putting employment out you know we're taking businesses and were put him out of business and now we're losing jobs\nUm it's not an easy answer Jeff it really isn't um and I haven't I don't have the exact answer for a ... well ... ... who does the Idaho\nAh certificates and they actually started bringing economic value to the state without having to travel to the other side of Wyoming to be able to go to a four year college and so that continues with community college here\nThe cost I mean this is general\nBut the values so on average\nA community college Coconino community colleges about ten thousand six hundred and twenty dollars per year for tuition okay per year ... six hundred let's go to a six hundred yes and\nUh the average for Arizona Public colleges is eleven thousand two hundred and forty dollars tuition per year\nAnd for Arizona private colleges it's twenty nine thousand one Ninety per year and these were you know figures that were given me so you could probably take her to leave\nThe drivers could have very little area but but thirty thousand a year right and that's in state in state Arizona bad I'm I'm kind of I Everytime I talk a community college in college issues with gas is always a little selfish because I have\nI have three kids and one of one of his Fifteen and Isabella usually ... right now during volleyball um but I'm thinking while I'm scratching my head like a lot of parents thinking\nThis is a lot especially if you have a few kids I've always been curious for a long time especially being a parent of three kids about how to you don't if my kids choose to go to college and I say that because in ... let's see if I get myself in trouble usually do least wants to show I have a relative\nWho just looks at the kids and all kids and comes from a maybe a different time a different mindset and says that everybody you have to go to college\nLet me ask you this and you know the one who jumping do you have to go to college I mean is it essential that if everybody right for college should everybody go to college [noise]\nYou know I think those are no I think those are good quite it's a good question and there are good choices not everybody wants to go to college some people really want to learn to specific trade we do know that if you have at least two years of college you're earning potential is higher\nI always hear that yeah more years I hear your and\nBut then I I always start out with the vet and the cost and and sometimes the missed opportunity because I mean I did not go to college and some people like half has [laughter] that's what it is we figured out um but I didn't and I look at those four years when a lot of and I'm not knocking him not don't most people should go\nBut I look at those four years where I ... I struggled but got going and really got ahead and had to work really really hard but I think everybody does even if you go to college you're going to have to work really really hard um okay but let's say you let's say you decided to colleges right for you\nNot everybody is right for but let's say you do decide one thing I Want to talk about is the trades were called the traits those or technical skills what kind of things can you learn is there anything such thing anymore as as an apprenticeship\nYou know what I'm saying where you can go learn how to frame where you can go learn how to be an electrician ... do you get that nowadays at a community college\nYou can get that at a community college and you can get some of it at our community college I thought were resource limited like want to give you an example do we do have a apartment maintenance certificate\nAnd there is the story of a recent graduate who who actually moved to ... phone you couldn't make it came back here didn't have any degrees or any any any background that way he was midlife\nYou went and got his a significant and apartment maintenance\nHe's now living in an apartment okay is in charge of taking care of that apartment so not only did he get a job he got a home in a place to live\nSo that is one example of the kinds of Korea training that we do now yeah but we've done a major outreach with our new leadership at the college for the last year and a half and this is not just surveys this is actually going out and holding meetings and saying what you need and [noise]\n[noise] that came back with we made a career and technical training we need a lot more than we have and that's exactly what this proposition is all about to provide that extra ten percent\nTo a budget that well a lot and we haven't even gotten to the opposite oh yeah you're heading there but that would allow us to do things like\nAuto mechanics now they can't do a full auto mechanics thinks that cost thousands of dollars in tons of ... what we can do is address what I'm\nA I'm garages are asking for and that is\nGet them off the first level so they know how to change oil you know how to do this and knew a little bit about automotive electronics I knew a little bit about this and that\nGave them to us at that stage and then we can train them the rest of the way you're going to learn hands on and I mean something like that right so but that's the kind of collaboration that our new administration's really looking for [noise] um that can go with all kinds of things solar energy for example um\nI get the basics in there and then solar energy company can take these folks and move on to the higher level so there's a lot of excitement about what this new revenue sauce will allow us to do and then we'll get to\nThat in just a second but many I mean that's just a follow up on what not to say [noise] there's a without going off in a whole nother change and that I spend hours every week on I won't do that to you but it's getting harder and harder for employers\nThere's a without going off on a whole nother change him that I spend hours every week on I won't do that to you but it's getting harder and harder for employers\nTo hire somebody with no experience because quite frankly the cost to hire them to let me use my experience when I when I was younger my step dad was a plumber\nAnd he paid me and pay me a lot I paid probably get a call from the office of labor standards in place of notice but he he paid me enough so that I could get by and screw up\nI mean I I don't know how he told me knowing that I was no floods the house and I literally flooded a house um because you you um you learn that's how you learn and that's what our Korea technical training as they forget that that level\nSo that the the the actual business doesn't have to live with your mistakes\nYeah and and that's the thing is I mean they're still gonna get mistakes but it's I guess my point is in this society is getting more and more expensive to employ someone and to pay for that first time employee who has no experience still exactly right\nAbsolutely and I've talked to several business owners who say it would be so great to have somebody that had those initial skills and then they would mentor them further\nSo that they as you say don't have to flood the basement and our business here but there's so much opportunity we've been on well we've been all over the county recently but I was in ... the other day\nAnd with the concern about the Navajos generating station closing down yeah\nAnd so what they're interested in in you briefly mentioned it is is solar they want to learn more about solar technology they want they're really eager to learn more about a gets you know in a part to me there's a self sufficiency and I think we find that all through our county 'cause it's so rural\nAnd then Jeff just one other thing I was thinking about you know not everybody is right to go to a four year college perhaps but this isn't just for\nStudents I'm coming out of high school this is for\nMy I'm well I'm not but somebody might be forty five years old and they would like to go back and get their nursing degree the cancer gone or do they run a pay for their kids to go to a four year college you know so one of the coolest things is northern Arizona college connection and\nI'm supervisor Fowler has worked a lot on this but it's where\nAny new uh didn't pay college Navajo tack and I'm seeing the sea and any U N N E you oh I'm Sorry I didn't say that\nHave come together and they really it's almost a fill the gap program each\nEntity works to their strengths and together they provided very holistic education program for people across the county with different campuses whether it's page or tuba or Williams and you know it's actually exciting to see this kind of a collaboration going on to provide\nFor the different needs of our residents\nLet me ask you this ah folks Mandy mess 'cause my my guests are not white proposition for Seventeen now I've been flooding my listeners with everything from statewide propositions initiatives\nAnd uh you elected folks who want to get into office to local ones we've been working to Flagstaff once this is a Coconino county one we still got to get the Yahoo by county and all these other cities\nUm everybody's got something going on you guys have there's a lot honestly and you guys are props for Seventeen um what is proposition for Seventeen that folks in Coconino county right all Coconino county will be voting on\nA very very quick in and letting ... because I Am on the board you might say hey I'm asking for me but man they will be asking for citizens but the point is proposition for Seventeen or\nWhat if it passes would allow

or do you know\nWhich countries have no minimum wage no never guess you mentioned off air Venezuela they actually have a high minimum wage now and they actually half price controls at the same time so they can really ramp up I'm going to say Iceland is yeah that's one of them yeah that's one of them Iceland Iceland\nDid that experiment where they gave everybody a minimum of you know thirty thousand dollars a year did not know Finland\nThat too and that they've pulled it back yeah didn't work yet and never works it never works actually uh well let me get to that because there's somebody proposing that we do that a again a here in the U.S actually or Sweden Denmark\nIceland Norway and Switzerland no minimum wage now folks will argue proponents of the minimum wage will say well but they have very strong trade and labor unions\nSo just because there's no minimum wage doesn't mean that people don't you know they're not going to work welding for you know five cents a day you know what I'm saying they they they still have the option that they they they're more organized I guess but the big one I think you should look at [noise]\nIt's more like a city state Singapore\nSingapore highly advanced I mean there's no there's places wealthy\nI'm no minimum wage in Singapore now Singapore is a very expensive place to live\nA very expensive some of the highest concentrations of of wealth or in Singapore some of the highest savings rates uh they said like forty percent of the year or something in the number was foreign reserves there like one and number two or three or four or something as far as foreign reserves and there are little they're like\nFive or six million people huge ... Jeff if\nThey would enact a Fifteen dollar an hour for minimum wage their economy would\nBoom yeah I mean they would they could really be don't you just could you imagine what Singapore could\nBe if they'd get their act together yeah and uh and Institute to a higher minimum wage but like I said if you didn't have a minimum wage and what's the point of a minimum wage when who is going to work\nThe market's going to dictate the market's going to dig up markets nobody's going to take that job for a you know like I go back to a welder there's going to be you know I yeah I'll do it for this price\nOr so it doesn't make any sense it works as some other countries but most countries do have some sort of minimum wage even the ones where people are fleeing from a and are heading up Mexico right now the caravan\nLeaving countries that have some kind of minimum wage but you can't get a job you know and I'm In which is very\nLow yeah minimum wage doesn't do you any good if there's no job\nAll right let's tackle a couple of 'em are these propositions that we have not gotten too and if you got a thought folks eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven when we'd love to hear from you I'm these proposition so I get more questions on the propositions than about any candidate infusing I think people have a good idea\nBy now of what candidate they want to vote for I think so but you can look at some of these propositions and you just go what in the world is this about do you think there's still some on a less when\nWe had George ... before we get to the props he said there was about Fifteen Percent of Republicans that we're still undecided on the Senate race between big Sally in cinema do you think everybody is made up their mind on the other races and maybe it listeners if you have you uh love to hear from you on that but do you think it's\nPretty much set I I Can't imagine\nThat there's very many people and certainly not Fifteen Percent that don't know who they're going to vote for by now yeah how could you I mean it's nonstop you've got to know these for but maybe people don't pay attention like we do know that that could be and if you do pay attention everybody's a crook a liar so who do who do you vote\nFor [laughter] they're all they're all according to all of them they're all crowded buddies\nBat um let's see proposition one twenty five what is this um it has to do with pensions what I don't get it so long I don't even know what to think about a few\nYears ago we now have a public vote did a lot of work I I was the mayor at the time and we\nWorked across the state to come up with a plan for public safety employees\nTo start a new pension plan for them didn't affect any existing officers but to start a new pension plan with different terms that this would not bankrupted the city's okay that was passed by the voters couple of years ago\nApparently the corrections officers\nI think people thought they are public safety employees and it turns out well they're not they were not included in that change so they're kind of out in the pension plan of their own\nAnd so they want to make the correction officers the same as the public safety officers so that's what a proposition one twenty five would do would make the same changes with the correction officers that were made to the public safety\nYou know I read the pros and cons on this one on proposition one twenty five the pros for passing it was all\nAlmost all a\nPolitician's state representatives say senators et cetera there was one lone opposition and he was a of current or former corrections yeah I think he was a you know he was a correction officer and he's just saying oh this isn't fair to the correction officers the new ... well it doesn't affect the existing\nCorrection officers it's only for new hires a after the laws passed okay so you ... the ones that were promised\nAnd this is a similar kind of thing you get a credit for your private school expenses I think it's up to five thousand dollars well why wouldn't you and I think\nGovernor juicy has endorsed this I'm most folks on the left of a said no I'm a wildlife and mentioned this was when he was on the show was that yesterday and it was yesterday [noise] um if you're stuck in a bad school\n... as a parent you'd want to do everything you can if I got to drive my kid or get my kid on the bus to go to another school district because this school districts stinks\nYou should have that right All right and let's say it's not that extreme Jeff let's say that there is a private school that really puts an emphasis on violin playing\nAn orchestra mhm and your child has that are ... yeah you want your child to go to a school that emphasizes orchestra\nWhy can you not have that right yeah you have that right you pay it out of your own pocket and pay all your school taxes as well that's the big thing you get into like double dipping\nSome probably half of your property taxes which are largely funds a girl schools um goes to the public district school or to the charter school that day the public charter school if you go there the money follows a someone described it maybe it was I Can't remember it was the money follows the backpack\nIn that situation so if your kid wants to go to school where they can do that specialty private school if three o five passes my understanding is K. to twelve the money would follow\nUp or if you'd be able to direct your tax money to that private school\nFor your credit on your your tuition costs so what's the problem\nI mean are they worried done the big schools are going to disappear the what I have seen as the public schools say it's going to impact the public school system I say more competition the better make them better and maybe the public school isn't this school for every child\nWell I envision where we have a lot more smaller schools and auctions or maybe your kid goes\nFor one specialty over here and then does something on line for something else I Wish there was more flexibility because I could see my kids\nI Wish I had the option where my kids went to the traditional school maybe in the morning and then in the afternoon they were learning more specialized things you know what I'm saying we need to start tailoring his stuff\nJust packing you know Fifteen hundred kids into a bohemian school in St thinking that that solution from the Nineteen hundreds is still the solution and that is already has the same curriculum yeah it's it's no good it's just not working anymore so\nWe'll see if prop three o five passes I Will vote for it or you\nVoted for yeah uh and you're one of the Seventy percent or ... real quick or you have a by county uh this is from very news dot com number of registered voters are up and you have by county um increase registered voters by four thousand two hundred and fifty four voters\nAh sixty you know the new numbers are actually higher\nSixty five thousand plus Republicans and you have to pay county twenty nine thousand Democrats forty four thousand other riches independent\nWhat is it a complete difference from you got two counties bordering each other Coconino and you have a pi ended his reverse it is blue red\nDo you think all the university has any effect on that absolutely and it'll continue to um increase you'll continue to see my prediction is Coconino county will become bluer and lower and lower the city of Flagstaff will become\nUm what's the darkest shade of blue\nPossible [laughter] that's kinda like our background on the on the ... show the logo so it is as blue as you can get that's where it's heading yeah I'm just because I think a lot of it does have to do with the university speaking the University of Jerry want to get your take on um public housing\n'em I we've talked a lot about proposition for twenty two\nPublic housing has failed miserably since like Nineteen thirty seven when Roosevelt started building these big things all around the country there is something like I don't know how some of them that have been abandoned unexploded and blown up crime ridden most public a lot of public housing\nIs not the way to go but Flagstaff is looking at this ... for twenty two\nWhich is the Robin Hood tax you remember that we've been talking about this forever you know this is a push by the mayor of Flagstaff AmeriCorps eleventh and the vice mayor Jamie wailing and it is so vague so big you voted on that\nI imagine oh yeah most definitely no on that I tell you I took a heads up on that one from\nA city council member Scott Overton mhm he has been talking about this quote affordable housing bond you know millions for what purpose we don't know exactly or he called it a train wreck\nJust train wreck and and now he's someone that's been on he's on the city council and he's been watching this from the beginning and he sees the pros and cons of it he calls it a train wreck I'm\nNot supporting that one yet that one's a mess\nWhat's interesting here is there was talk of condemning private property remember this as a matter of flights have one to condemn private property to use for quote unquote affordable housing now\nI called that the ultimate political blunder when she did it because for twenty two was coming out and it was going to the ballot timing was awful\nThat's a good example Jeff though of it for twenty two passes in the city council has twenty five million dollars to spend any way they want to do it we'll watch out\nThe interesting thing is this issue of condemning private property was requested uh the city was going to talk about this have a meeting on this it was supposed to be fast tracked it was the dumbest thing you could do politically if you wanted for twenty two the past\nIt has disappeared off the agenda it's gone I mean it's it's it's somewhere it's lined up right behind November six\nAppeared off the agenda it's gone I mean it's it's it's somewhere it's lined up right behind November six\nIf prop for twenty two passes that thing you watch will move to the front of light absolute but for for some reason to get the money they get the money yeah for some reason this item that was just ... we got to talk about this and other items that came up\nAfter that have already been talked about by the council this items gone it's gone up but it's not gone it's still out there and I want listeners to understand that if you're voting for for twenty two I don't know what I Do for you if you voted for for twenty two\nSomebody asked me the other day they said well don't we need just because like Steph doesn't have any low cost or affordable housing programs wrong Jeff we have three\nLow cost housing units a cyber homes branding homes Clark homes we also have numerous units that have been built and rented under the tax a tax credit program\nWhere private developer gets ... a tax credit for building an apartment complex and renting it at a lower rate\nWe have a number of those and we have what's\nIt called scattered sites houses all over town that are in the the for double housing program city has been very active in affordable housing is not likely big Nord it for years and now we have to catch up ... you will never have enough\n... affordable have no city is an enormous have enough isn't this just a mess at this point in Flagstaff I mean you might be able to help a couple select people and I think that's the biggest problem with the government stepping in as they were\nSome committee especially this proposition for twenty two will decide Jerry your situation is perfect for this here's ten thousand dollars we're going to help you buy a house and then you know suing Betty and Bob are right next to you and like well what about me\nAnd they get cut out because somebody decides who gets this yeah bender what's the criteria are there was a young couple of get a down payment assistance for very vague and nailed early person does not it's a very big it's it's very back a city should not be in the housing business there is also federal programs that every city has got\nThey get a certain amount of money and there's all kinds of federal programs are that are available are folks eight seven seven Ninety seven one three Ninety seven one here Jerry neighbors back in a minute [noise]\n... that show Monday through friday a three point\nBig shocker [noise]\nMost you've heard me talk about twilight janitorial you\nKnow that's why like janitorial company I use for all my business cleaning I use twilight janitorial because I Need a great cleaning service for my business and I know you do to\nSo focused on your business not on cleaning it and let twilight janitorial handle all your company's cleaning get twilight janitorial a call today night to eight\nEight five three eighty sixty four that's twilight janitorial\nNine to eight eight five three eighty sixty four\n\nDid you see them in the paper Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi are trying to impeach President Trump\nTunnel Halloran is an Obama Chicago Democrat and he votes like it I'm sure he supports Maxine\nOnce camel Halloran sneaks back to the swamp vote to impeach our president\nAnd immediately repeal our tax cuts that the open border democratic plan in two thousand Eighteen\nAnd we can't forget about the wall left wing billionaire George Soros in the
