in the air so bill Collins might have been on to something maybe there is something in the air because if you were these cases are pretty weird when we come back though we're going to jump into some

nothing left of her family anymore\n\nYou have another a case in in the book about a land disappearance that involves a really smart person somebody who's editor for what looks like great things his name is even read in his disappearance was in Nineteen Ninety nine in Oregon tell me about that one\nSo this is the one time out of the thousands of times where I read this case and I said you know\nI'm going to go against my own protocol I'm going to call the parents and I'm Glad I did\nBut Steven read missing June twenty third Nineteen Ninety nine salmon ... trail head outside of Sandy, Oregon about seven miles southwest of Mount Hood\nAnd for people who don't know a lot of disappearances amount ... around Mount Hood that I've written about before he was twenty four years old he's an intellect\nSuper smart kid I was a a third year medical student reports come from the clock in his county sheriff\nAnd uh when he was twelve years old as a gift for his birthday he asked his parents for the book called Grey's Anatomy\nKind of tells you where his head was that he knew he was he was going to be a doctor when he grew up you graduated from college with a ... biology degree five data cap a similar come loud it was accepted at Wayne State medical school first year medical school he was granted internship to the Mayo Clinic\nIn June of Nineteen Ninety nine at the end of his second year going into his third year took his first vacation in eight years and\nHe traveled to Oregon and check into some possible residency and so he was kind of mixing business was pleasure until the family wanted to see some wildlife mother told her son at the time never to hike alone please don't do that Steven\nOn June nineteenth you flew into Portland international airport got a vehicle from rental rock a shepherd cavalier drove to Portland Utah stole checked in and paid cash for Thirteen nights I'm sort of paint Thirteen nights with his credit card\nNow law enforcement report state on June twenty Steven called his parents on their on his borrowed cell phone from them\nSaid he had arrived all was well checked in things were great manager of the hotel said Steven usually left before the others will look he was last seen on June twenty second or the twenty third and\nHe was seen at night and a suit saying that the residency interviews had gone really well and he was happy\nOn June twenty second he drove his vehicle from the hostile to the salmon Huckleberry wilderness twenty five miles southeast Portland and completed the trail permit to enter the salmon view wilderness\nAnd they stop people here right now and tell you that you may think that when you complete those trail permits and put them in that little metal box that somebody's reading those and it's going to follow up and make sure that you come out\nThose trail permits are never reviewed and they're only used to see the load of people on the trail\nThere never checked to see if you came out there essentially worthless to don't ever count on those\nBut on June twenty third a pair of hikers\n... Stevens caused the trail had early in the morning and believed it had to be a day hiker but they were there really early well they executed the trail later that day and they still solve the car there and bothered them and they felt so strongly that something was wrong that they call the sheriff\nAnd a deputy came out Rand registration on the rhetoric of the vehicle came back register to a family\nAnd registration hadn't been turned over to rent a wreck yet so the deputy left a message on the machine at the family who still owns the car on the registration system\nAnd he left\nWell Steven was return was supposed to return to trade on July second the parents were at the airport and he didn't arrive they called the Portland police tried to file a missing persons report and they were told that you couldn't file a missing persons report unless you were there in person you\nKnow so the next day hope in Larry got on a plane and flew to Portland and the ... the search and rescue finally get down the trail and it seemed that some assistance from the national guard Kenya and since our teams searchers face rain and wet conditions for many of the days\nBut again the searched and searched for days after he really went missing\nAnd are hoping Larry praise the attitude of the volunteer searchers but stated that they were highly disappointed in the deputies\nThey send it to the search didn't last long and was terminated without finding anything cadaver dogs were later put into that area and never picked up ... percent they uh they had a psychic approach them\nAnd the psyche went with them and some for service people down the trail that came to switch back look down the cliff they saw little TPP structure native little trees lying on the ground\nAnd they said that down there you'll find Stevens glasses and that's where he died\nSearch and rescue went down there but they didn't bring their medical metal detector\nAnd it's like you said you needed that to find it but they never found it nothing was ever found there\nAnd they are hoping understood that they are now any communications with the sheriff in years none ever with the forest service Stevens never been found\nStarting a search almost two weeks after the disappearance is a very very difficult task and right here I'll say that Carol turned her when she disappeared in her park she at least less left a message on the inside of her car indicating when she was going to be out\nNow I see this every conference and I said on every time on 'em on with you people need to carry a personal located or be can cost about two hundred two hundred and fifty bucks there's no monthly service fee you can get 'em on Amazon you activated it sends a signal to a satellite that someone\nThey'll find you within eight feet the dispatch search and rescue I carry one every time I go out right I Would say that probably Ninety five percent of these cases could be quickly remedied if everyone carry one of these\n... whole lot of things went wrong in this case a just a a comedy of errors it's not very comedic though I mean but uh you know a search that starts that late\nDon't have much of a chance of succeeding you\nDon't think you do um first of all he wasn't real acclimated to the area didn't understand the dangers probably wasn't dressed for success probably didn't have a backpack away from I doubt if even George Will serve a map of the region\nBut when you go in an area like this there's so many things that can happen I mean I tell people that you could go down this trail and if it's a trail that isn't very active you could be on the trail five or six miles down and break your like on the trail and die on the trail\nAnd that doesn't that hasn't happened because it has and something very simple like this country ruin your life when you could just have this little device that could save your wife\nYou mentioned about the psychic that got involved in this case have you ever employed the services of a psychic or have you ever investigated a case where a psychic was used and they provided information that turned out to be accurate\nTell your story is um there's a remote here who's on coast to coast fairly frequently you will go unnamed but he he claimed he contacted me that he could find missing people\nAnd I asked him if he had ever found anybody and it gave me the name of this person and I listen to him and I said okay I'll give you a case and during that week that I didn't talk to him I contacted this victims wife I said hey that this person help you finding your husband\nShe goes she didn't do anything you ever found them he never gave me any valuable information my husband was found on other means by other searchers doing other things blah blah blah on and on\nGeorge I'm a guy that has really open mind I Will use anybody when somebody lies to me I won't use them ever again and that person blatantly lied to me\nAnd in other remote viewing cases there was one guy at a conference with a you're a couple of years ago really nice guy\nAnd the information he gave me wasn't even close in the realm of possible\nNow there's another guy who's a remote viewer that I'm trying to work with right now hopefully he's better but as far as psychics I did a conference in LA about two years ago and there were seven or eight psychic own this row or this outside area at the conference and\nTowards the end I walked down the road to introduce myself to every one of these psychic said what I did what I could use their services for each one of them said\nYeah yeah yeah we want to help wanted help for sure yeah we could do this I email each one of them the next week when I got back and I never got a response from what\nWe're talking with Dave ... about his

are they we\nWe have a recording of a news report that was done based on this and then includes ah some of the clips from that phone calls so maybe we could play that right now and then on the other side you can tell me a little bit more about it\n[laughter] it's\nOnly now unlike anything you've ever heard before [noise]\nYou're right with it [noise]\nIt's very little actually talking I said what are you concerned that disturbing yeah well the night talking on Henry negate Celso it with Labor Day timber and\nYeah eight in the morning McCain worried white earned demented helpful for ... minutes

and a link that\nNow isn't that the other I think you recording didn't again speaking at an event you just stay on it [noise]\n\nIt it's one of the nation equally revealing this elite you know ... even the FBI is analyzing the recording and boy did she investigates engine here on\nTuesday [noise]\n'cause I see which borders you know you and say late all areas where McCabe was recorded\nScene or cell phones teams played him since he only wanted to search they ain't nothing in ...\nSo that's a news report from a Minneapolis television station or she the reporter mentioned in that report did that or the FBI was analyzing it the police were trying to make some sense of ... have you ever seen any of that analysis or reports or did they come doing any kind of conclusion what the heck that was\nNever it climbed up so tight but one thing that I've written about and pass books is that the FBI follows these cases there's no reason for gifted FBI to be involved in this it's a local jurisdiction missing person that's it\nWhy is the FBI sticking their noses in this\nUnless they are interested in it for some other reason\nNow but last tower\nThat they pick up that phone was near Silverlake road and Mississippi street new Brighton one mile east or the Mississippi River\nIn many cases I've written about in the past in missing for one and want a sobering coincidence dealt with men very healthy men that were found in bodies of water many times in the Mississippi when this happened I thought it'd be found in the Mississippi or something else really close\nWell the location where he was eventually found was searched multiple multiple times canine telecommuters ground teams everything on November second this is almost two months after he disappeared for twenty in the afternoon\nA kayaker was on rush Blake one mile south east of the last time they cannot fall on and they saw body and the water and they recovered it\nThere was no violence at all to the body according to the corner the termination on the count on the cause of death was freshwater drowning Syria had been search multiple times and the FBI had that recording for analysis why was Henry McKay in the water\nNow one of the things that I presented in sobering coincidence about all of these young healthy men was that many times the families did not accept the determination by the corner on the cause of death and they paid for secondary autopsy several\nTimes when they did the second autopsy they found very high levels of GHB in the system of the victim and they were in level so high it didn't make sense so GHB it's commonly known as that date rape drug people get it\nThey pass out\nThey realize that they're awake but they can't move and they can't react and if you think about this many of the times that these people have disappeared\nNever has any of their friends relatives et cetera seen the point where they disappeared sometime they disappeared amongst friends\nThey couldn't explain how they got from point a to point B teenage couldn't track point to point a lot of times that happened in the winter and there was no marks in the snow point the point\nAnd if you think what GHB does to you it puts you in that state were you realize what's happening to you but you can't react so if they lead lead you say in a a bank\nOf snow you would die from hypothermia you wouldn't die from GHB intoxication\nIf the police to you on the water you would die by drowning knock from G. H. B. and C. G. H. B. is not one of the twenty six drugs that are screened routinely by corners across the United states\nIt's only caught if you pay an extra amount to do this much more advanced screening for drugs and so it's a very very rarely if ever found in systems because most people can't afford a second autopsy and I'm not saying that that is what is in all of these cases\nBut it showed up too many times to be ignored\nThat they are recording it certainly seems like he realizes he's in trouble or painter agony and then as the reporter mentioned it sounds like there's somebody out there that says stop it that's um that's ah that's difficult to get your head around\nIt is and in many of the other cases I've written about that are related to these water unbelievably the victim is on the phone as they are going through this transition of disappearing\nOne time not far from where this incident happened a college kids walking down the street he's on the phone with a girlfriend has been says where are you I Need you here now I Need you here now phone cuts off you sound days later in the Mississippi River another time a kid in east a western Minnesota\nIs missing and his parents are trying to find him and he's on the phone with him and he goes I don't know where I Am blah blah blah blah blah blah boom\nPhone goes dead he was never found yet his car was found so these incidents that happened were there on their cell phone is something new and different but when you listen to the incident as it evolves it's very uncomfortable\nI mean it seems like they're being abducted kidnapped um and sometimes the bodies were found in sometimes they aren't and they're they're just like snatched by persons are known by things unknown almost like no one gigantic bird swooping down in matching them up\nUm you know so many\n... agrees is calling me\nAll the time and saying well you know we talked about the survey I heard you on the YouTube say this is I don't say that and\nI Want people to understand that this is not a conspiracy theory topic because I'm not giving you and your theories I'm giving you off facts and that's\nThe way I Want people to understand this is that it is\nTied together the way an FBI profile or will profile a series of crimes were linking together a series of facts to show that there's continuity here\n\nBut there are patterns say in this book I wouldn't think you'd have cases in the air um that would qualify under your criteria but you do you have a bunch of them and and it starts with looking at twenty angles including one that's here in Nevada right\nThat Ninety seven point one big shocker\nNow more than ...

one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I'm I think I'm going to open up the phone lines you know people are going to want to talk to you a little bit the Scotland cases guide Norman Peter gives you summarize that one\nSure I'd separate twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy five nine thirty occurred on the island of mall it's an island in Scotland fifty five years old\nI Gibbs was a war hero he was an intellect and he was a pilot we spit fires and the battle of Britain in Nineteen forty he was staying at a place called the Glenn force the hotel and it sat right on the ocean\nSide of the island a mall and there was a grass airstrip there and the rooms were right next to the airfield looking at the water\nYou arrived at the hotel on December twenty F on December twenty thirty contacted the owner of a Cessna one fifty parked at the strip and asked if he could fly it\nIn Hamilton was the attorney negotiated a price to fly\nThe two seater and on Christmas Eve Nineteen Seventy five at nine thirty gives wiped out to the plane with a hotel guests named Felicity Granger and she thought she was going to go with him on a flight but he told her no she had to lay off the torch a suit can fly inland so\nShe exits the plane places the torches out in the field and he or she sees him taking off the plane flying out over the water\nNow some reports say that after he took off they saw strange lights on the water some people said it might have been a fishing boat but they could never identified the boat and they can never see where the lights went\nWell make a long story short gives didn't return on the plane and there was a major search on and off the island for days and they found nothing and they found a sheep herders and ranchers that search all their property they got nothing\nWell on April twenty first Nineteen Seventy six it was about four months after it the disappearance\nGifts his body is found on the north pole\nAnd this is an amount and it's like an oil near and dear field and he has a small scratch on his chin nothing else\nAnd a shepherd took part in the original search and he walked by the spot where the body was found multiple times and never saw it now if given the jumped from the airplane there should have been more injuries and broken bones\nAnd they never found the plane nothing physically was wrong with him so he could walk back to the hotel the best everyone could tell the quarter stated the cause of death was exposure\nMeaning hypothermia and I guess that he probably died two hours after takeoff well they examine his clothing and there was no salt or marine organisms on the body that means he didn't go into the ocean and crawl out unanswered questions were is what were the lights on the water\nReally how did you get there\nReally how long has he been dead where was the plane and then my notes on this I write down GHB again because there's no reason for a man to die of exposure on the top of a mountain\nWhen people get cold they get up and they walk you don't lay down and die obviously the top of a mountainous colder than the bottom or where you could see humanity from the top of this mountain strange case\nYou know I've seen a some people respond to some of your cases that the weird ones where the clothing is missing and I've seen people trying to explain in a way of saying people do weird things when hypothermia sense then they'll take off their clothes and and walk into snow and and do things that seem logical um\nHow would you respond to those kinds of ah remarks and would sit here and it seemed to\nWell one of the things is I look for cases that are insurmountable meaning that explanation doesn't fit\nI have several cases where somebody leaves the house and within a hundred yards of the house they find a pile up close\nAnd personal left the house and it was Seventy degrees out later that night to get down to fifty but the person left the house and in a hundred yards all their clothes is gone and they're in a stack in this field has happened multiple times\nAlso I've had other cases where a parent says might be be couldn't take off their clothes\nSo if somebody saying they remove their clothes and they died hypothermia good luck with that because\nThe kid couldn't take off their clothes so the cases I Try to include tried I tried to explain this rationally now there's a group out there that don't want to understand this and they want to explain it away with the book you kind of stuff and that's fine\nBut the reality of it is is that there's there's usually no rational explanation for why this stuff happens\n\nYou know in the alien abductions deal I don't know if you've read any of that there are some cases that are almost humorous or that where there'll be somebody who's taken by some entities and they come back in their clothes run backwards or she was missing or I'm\nAgainst somebody else's underwear on a or they're rare cases where multiple people say they're taken and their clothing is switched when they wake up in the morning I'm no there can be all kinds of explanations for why people take their clothes off\nA that don't involve aliens but it it reminded me of some of the cases that you have in your books where\nPeople clothing is found its kinda folded up it's a it's neatly placed somewhere away from people and um it's not torn up as if my bears or something it's just weird\nI've written of cases in this book and other books were special notes were made that the clothing and the body was impeccably clean like it just came out of a laundromat and the body just came out of a shower\nAnd they couldn't explain why everything was so clean\n\nAnd you have cases where bodies or kids are found they'd been missing for a couple of days they'd been in the wilderness no food or water and there's not they're not really they they're not whether there is not like they've they've been out in the in the open for very long at all\nCorrect so where are they where do they go\nWell the same thing applies to the water related cases when where the bodies of water it just certain things that we know certain things to the hair loss of hair wrinkle ing of body fingernails things like that and when these bodies were pulled out\nCorners of made statements that well the person disappeared on Monday but they've only been in the water for twenty four hours but they've been gone for six days so where they were if they'd been for all this time\nAnd that's the importance of behind finding a body especially water because it shows things that it wouldn't show otherwise\nIt's almost like it's a ... or all harvesting that whoever who met\nOr whatever is taking people it needs something from them unless it's just malicious it needs something for a moment and some\n... some of these people never come back at all and some are just discarded or when they're not needed anymore um I mean I I Know you're reluctant to go that far but it sort of what it feels like\nOne of the questions I get all the time is are these people ever found to be abused sexually abused things missing from the body not the case\nThey are found pretty much intact without a lot of injury to him I mean one of the things that people have said a lot is that what if what you're doing is they're oh\nWell I mean I don't know how you measure that I don't either\nBut I've heard those kinds of allegations of uh what some other intelligence what their interest in us might be and it's it's a tough one to prove I don't know what it would take for you\nWhat kind of evidence that would take for you to reach a conclusion I guess it it would take maybe film or video of one of these um incidence\nWhere or when we first started this trip together years ago\nPeople said oh he knows what it is you know it right gotta be something mundane maybe some crypto topic that he just doesn't want to talk about what's come a long way\nAnd I think if you start shutting the door to early you can't ... really what may be obvious years later that's one of the reasons I've been reluctant to say anything that\nYou know maybe a possibility because it may cause that works for me\nAnd them with a friend of mine and the guy she fits all the criteria she had you know al ... said she had a medical condition anything should expert

any it could have anything to do it it's safe or not but it's just they're all kind of strange things that I might even mentioning that phone call you guys had sounded like it but because I could dig for\nWell do you know we're going to get Dave to react to you dropped a lot of stuff on there and we'll get Dave's reaction to some of that I mean all those ideas have been proposed before I I'm I suspect that he's going to tell us that we don't have enough information to ah to assign it to any one of them But Dave you can speak for yourself\nOr or or hit on one of those things are the cell phone hanging up about a case in Michigan\nSeveral years ago and they track the sky on over this area\nAnd according to the kings and according to where it hit he would've had to have crossed a road

been and where they were originally working but it just like the lady said the kings didn't make any sense it's probably more often than you're here and\nEveryone kind of ... often says well you know maybe it's just the technology we don't know maybe it's not that good for some reason we're getting these paintings in these areas\nAnd it's disconcerting that they happen because and now they only throws off the search there's never an adequate explanation of how it got their\nFirst time caller Brent in Redding, California Hi Brent welcome to the program\nThank you very much for taking my call what's on your mind to question\nDavid you've talked about how are people when they have come they haven't remembered anything that happened to them so I bought it\nLooked into perhaps there are people witnessing is it that but\nThere are somehow having their memory a race that also you've talked about the German connection so I wondered if you've ever looked into mysterious ... Germany if perhaps they're more common there\n\nSo German Germany is tough I I don't speak German I I don't have a contact in Germany there are a couple of people who have purchased the books that have read and I've never gotten anything back out of Germany indicating that it's more prevalent there than not\nWhat about the mines being a race but you have written about about problems that people have been remembering where they've been\nCorrect and uh that's an obstacle especially with kids it's a touchy one uh I don't think that many parents want their children to go through any regression hypnosis to try to figure out what happened because they probably want their kids to keep that memory suppressed\nNow parents adults that might be a different idea might be something to look into if there happens to be somebody that will of the claims that in his willing to those are a lot of\nHurdles right there\nYou have some cases where kids are taken they're very young and their explanations are pretty weird so no one takes them seriously about you know I was taken away by the big talking mayor or something along those lines right\nYeah those are those are hard to explain and you know a lot of people a reporter wall put in the article you know that's just the kids imagination the search for said wow is it or is it not\nOn the wild card line Carolyn North Carolina hello Carol\nMy I

ability and they practice when they're in the woods who knows if it's true and who knows if they do it but I've heard that before\nBut no indication that there is some kind of nanotechnology involved

that you might want to leave your information with the with the Donna or call screener tonight and I'm\nDavid might want to talk to you and I appreciate calling in and sharing that with going west of the Rockies Roger in Bellevue, Washington my Roger\n... is a man could George or Mr now um I wanted to a related story to Mr polite as a about a missing people are in the Bellingham uh area of the Washington state\nUh that are over several years at least a recent and in the past uh have uh turned up missing a and a later on some of their body part and mainly their feet have shown up in the uh\nIn a water are in different areas and ah [noise] in since uh during that time period or my wife and I had a\nHad the misfortune of having a miss a missing son and he was a very well trained a boy scout and oh we figured that uh you know the uh since it's been two years now\nThat uh you know it's a well nothing ... nothing I was turned up in terms of evidence or anything like that so the uh the local law enforcement the closed the case and ah and because he's an adult we can't go forward with it because of his wife\nAnd a and so we're we've been kind of stuck with that but I wanted to find out as a minister of ... are being aware of this a phenomenon of a\nOf the the issue and uh it's it's been a well publicized and newspapers and in over there\nYou know what I mean I'm sure you've heard of that and uh you know if you wanted to try to contact them we have a we have links on that goes to goes website is website is can am missing dot com that's where you reach a days I I Know he knows about the the the story because it was a widely publicized but your son\nI'm One of the circumstances where did that happen and when\n[noise] okay\nAnd didn't bailing ham and it happened or just on the outskirts of town and uh he basically what happened uh it and this happened two years ago October\nUh he uh he had left\nHome and uh we believe that maybe there may have been uh\nSome friction at home but uh he has left home and he got into the vehicle and evidently it ran out of cash and a and didn't have any money to get cash so he took up walking\nAnd it was nightfall at the time and he tried to call him and his wife back in a that was the last that they had heard from him a ... when he had stated that his phone was dying and he was lost and lost in the woods somewhere\nAnd couldn't find its way out and uh and and then we had a a massive search uh for the next two days\nIn a row with uh with uh the\nLaw enforcement we also had a had helicopters they had dogs shed a drones uh I mean they covered or that area over ten mile stretch and nothing at all showed that\nPeriod and ah we were just show a broken over that uh and uh\nAnd since then I have actually personally myself I have called in and talk to a few times to some of the people that they actually investigated on it and they just basically told me that uh that they were a a ...\n... they were basically are held by the laws of the state in and of course the\nThe wife uh uh that uh any information given out a would be specifically only given to her\nUh and that the parents couldn't find out anything you know after that so wow Dodger that reason why yeah I'd like to\nTry to uh maybe a get a shot at a you know talking to David is brightest and she would uh see what he thinks\nI I Would just you try that website that okay good that is but also you can leave your name and number with Donna and uh I'll pass on to Dave\nI'm that's a that's a rough story to to uh tell on the radio I'm sure I thank you for sharing it with us and you know I can imagine that that's a whole but never going to be right in the fact that you just don't know it was just a is brutal\nA thank you Roger thanks for calling in would try to get one more call in before we go to a break a Joe in Long Island on the east of the Rockies Bonnie Hi Joe Hi\nGeorge ah I did a couple of seasonal gigs to national parks a glacier and canal in Alaska\nAnd one thing I Would say uh especially looking at an alley the infrastructure of the park is very limited uh they have like a road that goes to mount McKinley that ... is winding mountain road that bus it can take a bus\nNo real hiking trails\nAnd if you go off the uh those roads like the flooding would be that the hiking so\nI I I Would say it and I would call late to slip glacier ah they really on the play chess how treacherous a trail ... for example in glacier it would be on latches on actual trials that are like twenty mile trails for like two three four miles\nSo I I think a lot can go wrong uh and uh you know if someone was like say by themselves and they hurt their ankle and couldn't proceed ah that I don't know anything could happen with the wild animals that would be one thing now I don't think\nAh what's happening as some sort of Charles ... group that all looking to just fine isolated hikers and do something with them I never really got the impression although I read that like criminals with hideout Yellowstone for example I don't think that people go to those parks to like\nA just a pounce on someone that's an isolated hiker\nSo I I I I Would speculate that that's not what happened what is happening\nUh but uh I I think what David Sanger about the national parks is very little supervision people are\nAre you know there are just off on their own toward the gray and I've done that including myself or any number of times where something happened on the trail uh nobody would have no where I was at one more thing on that is my ... both theory is what you said about the birds\nAre swooping down I did see a Glacier National park like these tiny birds but they almost right on the crowd I for one of his says it looked like something from Jurassic Park\nSo I Do wonder if that ... vote right there is some sort of ... historic bird that might be out there but that's my coast to coast theory\nI'm you know the idea that they're criminals and national parks national forest I think that's probably true you know there are criminals pretty much everywhere that humans go uh in addition you have a lot of people who are grow grow weed out there in in the\nWilderness places and uh and would do anything to protect it and um you know but those kinds of cases are generally weeded out of the David database if we're talking about people who banish I'm under very strange\nSpecific kinds of circumstances and there was no tracks there was no indication that people are around a ... they can vanish within a few feet of their family members or the people or hiking with so it's very weird and I don't think that uh criminals being out there could explain\nPretty much any of the cases that are a boiled down and David books but a appreciate that thought or we're gonna take a break now and there's a lot of folks on the phone lines of will get do as many of your calls as we can I noticed a couple of folks have their own stories with a encounters strange and counters in the woods and\nYou know it's been a while since I've been hiking out in in the wilderness areas but um\nBut I can understand how the elements can ah can sort of close in on you a little bit and uh it gets pretty creepy out there sometimes the or we're going to go to the break the shell and taste take us into the break and we'll be right back\n\nAnd he had a whole is white faster like he's being drawn to it here and there was like ... you know I definitely think of like a greyhound\nHey just walking on both parts later on a couple of weeks later because we're running out of their company and it never was ever nothing was ever said about it every year you know anything about backyard\nI don't know anything about that specific creature or agree to report but I Do know that uh the ... I'm a I'm area has been a hotbed for really weird stuff very long time\nOr the guys who investigated the skin Walker phenomena Utah spent some time on the ground up there collecting information and stories rumble locals including the tribe\nAnd had reported the number of different kinds of creatures it's always been a UFO hotspot or at least in the last fifty or so years so there's a lot of weird stuff concentrated in the area you're discussing\nUh but no I hadn't heard the story about the the um things pulling people out of their sleeping bags room rock lake thanks for sharing that do appreciate it we're going to go east of the Rockies to Roy in Youngstown, Ohio morning Roy\nHey how're you doing\nAll right what's on your mind hey um I remember um ... this evening are you guys were talking about a ... you were talking about this couldn't walk around right and uh and I literally stood up and said that it and I point out the radio because\nI've read all the books I've read all the four one one books I've read the scan walk ranch book\nUh and I've been following this thing for some time for several years or\n... was ... when you guys were talking about that all kinds of things to come to mind a rich lived a certain number of uh disappearances are\nLot of disappearances happen on or near Richland and at this couldn't walk ranch that's on a ridge like uh\nLet's see uh a hundred percent success rate every time an individual is taking no one ever see them being taken over the skin Walker ranch\nWe're dealing with with with something that is highly intelligent and it knows whatever's somebody's on the property or on around it is just to me I I'm just saying to me or am I in my opinion I think that you know the the skin walking ranch uh\nIs very close to uh the\nThe phenomenon around and go for one one\n[noise] well I you know I think there are some similarities in it than it is whatever it is it seems to be intelligent and it seems to know what people are doing before they do it themselves and it's still the that's for sure the only difference is there at skin Walker to my knowledge no one has disappeared animals have been other here but not people\nYou know there has not been any people are saying but there has been a you know yeah I mean that's the other side that we have had animals missing but then we've also had mutilation\nYou know the thing that doesn't fit there would be that ah when people have gone missing there's been no explanation of a gouge marks on them other than scrapes with things like that no no kind of like ... or something of an alien and would do when you read a function stories and things like that\nBut that that doesn't fit but as far as rich lines go um and uh and the high intelligent or is it a hundred percent success rate or no one ever sees sees it ah\nThat that to me is uh some good strong march there\nThe way thanks thanks for sharing your impressions with is that a lot to chew on appreciate your calling in we're going to go to the wild card line Mario in San Antonio Texas or he has a citing he wants to tell us about\nWelcome welcome George our age a ticket for taking my call through I wanted to be my experience a sheer at a park in San Antonio which they added another channel miles of bike trail connect a couple of parks\nAnd um this wooded area where even do with daylight at the time almost literally me and my wife were using a pie slowing down to chart the course I was a little ahead of her and uh you got to this one area where it got kind of dark even though it was daylight but it was so would it that it was\nThe son satellite was shining through as much as I started kind of got kind of dark in that area and when I stop to it when my wife was that I noticed some kind of something just staring at it and it was done on the stump they look more like a bird\nUp but uh you know you never know I mean it's kind of felt like it was like seven feet tall ... feet\nAnd just there and then on the stump just a staring at me and my wife when she approached a mean looking at something she load and we kinda look kind of stunned that each other and I said that you see that and she's like yeah so when they saw was just awesome we just\nSaw it back a bit flying away but the wingspan was so large that wasn't um\nIt was like a regular bird you know what I mean we have ducks in a ... in all kinds of stuff and not spend a park nearby but this is a real heavy area would it\nBetween parks where they had made a bike trail and that's all it is\nAnd so I just want to share my

that you knew staring at you but you you could just see us up like a form of shape\nBut you couldn't really tell exact details especially when there wasn't that this that and I I think the first thing

we will here tonight in the air as well so this evening we will hear the latest including a few cases that are ongoing at this moment fresh\nMysteries that maybe you can help solve a David joins me in just a few minutes and we will jump right into it but those who do not familiar with the mystery we'll start with a refresher on the characteristics that make these particular cases stand out from a standard case of somebody who just gets lost in the ...\nAnd this goes way beyond that and we will spend the next three hours talking about new evidence and cases he uncovered and then the last hour tonight I'm not sure what we're going to do I I think I'd like to hear from listeners your ideas about what's going on here why some people are seemingly taken by whom\nAnd whether we will ever be able to resolve this so put your thinking caps on and be ready to jump into the discussion in our for also tried to save some time for you to interact with Dave as well in our three\nOne news note here in Las Vegas we're on the eve of a somber remembrance one year ago October first but worst mass murder incident in American history unfold fifty eight people were gunned down that an outdoor concert on the strip hundreds were wounded or injured\nKind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found disappearances and their parks were they had worked that bothered him didn't make sense when they tried to find information that couldn't\nAnd they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of the freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get the outstanding training or smart people they understand what should be done and I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any less and they don't have any of us and missing people in their parks in jurisdictions\nAnd uh we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues to ... refiled and they came back into turning called this time it's like why do you want this information\nAnd explain to him I said hey you can't ask that as a determining factor in for you and they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said wow research and then he came back and he said well you don't have any of us and missing people\nI said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol and you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are to the detectives\nSo somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or accumulate list their headquarters to understand what's happening and it's only politically correct if somebody calls in and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it\nAnd said no we don't have any less so\nYears ago somebody said well David you ought to just file a request and see how many rolls of toilet paper it Yosemite National park I bet they have that inventory list\n[laughter] and of course they would but as it happened\nThey came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my authors status\nAs an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books aren't enough libraries to qualify there's no such qualifiers just some arbitrary thing they said and\nThen I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together the lesser I Want to list from Yosemite and I want to less from the national Park Service and they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire system and\nI Can't tell you how many people since I first said that years ago have tried to go at the park\nService and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting the list from their entire system because we still say they don't have it and I've done interviews on other stations were\nHosts have said Dave I'll say it right now we will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets\nAnd we'll put a clip boards at every park and every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating a list and they could hire an intern during the summer that can screen the monthly reports that come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now\nOf course they they wouldn't even respond and wouldn't even acknowledge it\nBut as you've stated in many others after you nobody believes they say that there's a list exists\nWell a ... if they're going to charge one point four million more than a list exist um you know it's it's pretty clear they don't want to cooperate on this that they don't want to pay more attention to be drawn to it and uh\nSo we're going to explore and maybe some of the reasons behind it up for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the ... points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books and the kinds of things that you look for\nSome people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people you're not going to get a lot when you read a thousand certain things started jumping out at you\nAnd when I went through my third three hundred four hundred five hundred read reports started making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four five six thousand then things really starts\nIt out one thing that's about Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine strip search and rescue they can't I Can't find a set and they can't track the person down now someone who worked at a canine unit on the farm team for a number of years\nOur dogs had about a Ninety nine percent capturing and probably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week and it's directly relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be\nAnd there's a lot of people out there don't have the time to train a dog a lot\nThere might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe the ... isn't there I bet reports where the dogs are brought to the set location where the person was last seen they walk a foot they turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out like they don't want it to search or they have no interest\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change weather event\nIf the victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times\nThe time of the disappearance a high high percentage of the time if three four five PM many of the victims have some type of disability illness or congenital abnormality\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can explain what happened to him water\nPlays a key role in this either the person disappears very near water or they're found in or near water borders in granite play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world to Seventy national park\nOh that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anywhere in the world but rather play so much more of a role as I explained in many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation\nYou're walking down the trail with your friends your loved one and they walk ahead of you you fall behind them\nThat point of separation something happens and that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that in interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report that's where it happens\nIt's almost like something's watching and when you split off from a group or a family that's when they move in yeah\nEquipment malfunction and this is a this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and prior books\nThere was an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with the searches\nAnd then people talk about other equipment their car other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this [noise] and then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that have vanished the\nProbably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is\nI've written about physicists of a German heritage that have disappeared\nI'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and have never been found it's very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared but isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a\nMedical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nSo when when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that I'm interested in the specific profile that I just laid out here\nAnd there is a this geographical fostering that I figured out why after I started putting Ken's at a U.S map when I started to track this years ago\nAnd right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada now there are other locations in Lebanon other countries of the world where these this exact same sort of thing happening\nA lot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book struggling to get rolling and people are different parts of the world read them they say hey you know I live in New Zealand and we've had a whole series of these very true Australia same thing you case same thing Canada same thing in Spain in the eighties worse I mean\nYou'd be surprised how this fits into this little niche\nUm and it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred thirty five cases and it's men to women there's more to one ratio correct I\nAny idea why why so many more men than women maybe more men are out in the outdoors and out there alone\nYeah yeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risks than women I guess\nWe're talking with David Blaine is about his latest work missing for one one land air water coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific cases and uh as I said before they raised the hair on the back of your neck at the Beatles that gets into the break we'll be right back\nAll right um talk for\nJim rescue parameters because then that information becomes key to you picking the cases that use zero in on I mean there are metrics there are\nThere's data um search and rescue um how how they proceed and in a huge database and I would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been ruled to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most times a lot of times they want there was a case from eighty six\nI'm an era the girl's name was ... she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody's looked at the case in Twenty years and especially if they're told me I'll never see that case\nIt's a standard missing persons case there is no suspect there's no crime why can't I see\n'em and just so people understand in law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal uh everything else in the law enforcement world is criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against water go missing if you want to fall out of society you can and it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's going to eliminate from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle you're somebody\nThat these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nAnd a lotta times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times that are really really good and I don't understand why there and want us to see it but there's this I called territorial behavior\nAnd many of the times they won't grant you access\nNow in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure\nLaw that reports have to be disposed to the public upon the crust Colorado has outlaws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law but many states don't and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything um so the first\nThing is you got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say the storage you can't trust the media because I Would say eighty percent of the time when I finally get a copy of the report\nThe news reports are totally completely wrong compared to what law enforcement said happened\nAnd I like to think back Thirty years ago forty years ago when there were reporters at really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's this superficial job of collecting information\nIt's really not too good these days\nWell I Would think that um you know reporters just regular beat reporters who get assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case\nYou know like outside of Las Vegas and then a couple that you and I talked about before it's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement there is a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of the scene I'm who tells you specifics here the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take it further you you defer to them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they'd really don't want to know the full story of what's going on 'cause it's too weird ... explain\nMakes me wonder about the national Park Service whether they don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks or they don't want to give me the information because they have been a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know they don't want to have to answer questions about what do you think\nI think that the people the front line people that you see when you go into the parks\nHeart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking to you about nature those people have no idea what's going on it's the people at the top tier in the government\nThat are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed and communicated and it's those individuals that have this\nThey exude this belief that it's their stuff it's not yours and you're not going to get it and I don't understand it I Can't\nExplain it and every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports when the sheriff's office helped on a search and they had some of the reports from the national Park Service as well\nAnd mistakenly they just sent me everything and so I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and I got ... I wasn't supposed to get that but\nThen it gives me some insight as to what's going on but it's rare\nLet's talk about a couple of cases uh you you sent me some information about one Samantha Sayers what's the deal there\nSo twenty eight years old high performing person good athlete\nCame from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle she'd like to go to this a location a called ... per ... V. E. S. P. E. R.\nAnd she went there on August first this year it's about six thousand two hundred and twenty feet elevation two miles northeast a spate of lake twenty five ... five miles east of the ocean port a Suzanne\nRound trip hike up about seven eight miles twenty seven hundred foot game going up\nAnd a Thirteen hundred foot scramble to the top\nSo I live in Colorado I can tell you that that really isn't much here but in in Washington that's a pretty good hike and the mountains there it just sixty two hundred feet look a lot like the mountains here fourteen thousand feet well\nSamantha did a walk right she told her boyfriend where she was going when she'd be back and she was the kind of the guys that kept track of her well when she didn't check in with him\nHe reacted the right way he went he went out and look for her while the investigation showed that she made the summit sometime too in between two and three in the afternoon and some other individual man saw her at the ... summit in communicated with her\nWell that was the subsequent investigation her boyfriend Kevin arrived at the mountain about ten pm started running the trails yelling for screaming for\nEventually called the snow homeless county sheriff and the search was on so that was on August first well that search went on for about twenty two days three hundred and fifty seven or operations that is extraordinary that's locked\nHundred and five hours of drone time a three hundred and twenty nine hours of difference our personnel the family was on the scene everyday when you look at the area the ...\nOf what looked to be Timberline there isn't much up at the top of desperate to pretty wide open area\nAnd for them not to be able to find her under these circumstances is really really unusual they add cadaver dogs they had sent tracking dogs they had everything you can imagine there to help\nWell eventually when the sheriff and the search and rescue personnel pulled out I mean that's that's a check on reality time if you're the family because you're looking at going back to Pennsylvania without your daughter and basically just Chuck it in with no more assistance\nWith his family had a lot of gumption they start pushing harder they did some Kickstarter campaigns\nAre trying to pay for a food and things for friends that were just stand on site and searching day and night well ... I don't even know how somebody wanted me to get to talk to the mom and the mom and I communicated and I kind of gave them this road map\nAnd it's the same thing I've said is that you've got to get these reports otherwise you're just going to be replicating that exact same effort that search and rescue stung before that a lot of instances that may turn some results because\nPeople are found in areas that have been previously search that's true but if they have a lot of area where they say that they haven't searched it very thoroughly and the state that on the reports which they do not Syria you really want to give it a big push\nBut the mom told me that they weren't getting any cooperation from the sheriff the sheriff wouldn't get many reports the search and rescue people weren't given him any reports and they were getting frustrated now this is the same thing I tell every family and if there's one listening out there is this what you have to do\nYou don't go to the local news media

think my younger sister does\nIsn't it interesting how it becomes a almost a family thing although some people get involved in it at work in the workplace let's have a couple of guys they have at the red radio America terror we were originally network in the I'm In the in the sort of pantry room there or they have a big coffee maker don't I remember that\nYeah there was a pretty normal coffee machine and someone who comes in in the morning and it's like did you make coffee and I'm like no how many times to tell you every day I have not made lightly and you'd be responsible for making coffee ... well yeah it's not that I'm responsible for making it for them it's just that I get in first and I think most people expect if you get into work or\nAbout four or five AM that you will be drinking coffee\nBut look at the industry that has made the mind these coffee shops for the cure rigged and things like that that are aimed at one thing one thing I mean that's\nMaking coffee coffee pots\nCoffee I remember we used to have 'em and aluminum pot around and that when people would come over can we have some coffee and they made it the grounds and stuff where on in the coffee and there was some kind of a stranger or has a little aluminum thing that boil the water on the stove or that and the coffee was put into a\nKind of a shift or looked like a just kinda weird but um and then I remember\n... ... I remember that metal coffee pot you'd you realize that's what we're talking [laughter] what the metal coffee pot [laughter] remember the craft\nNo I don't know what I'm not sure what your music funny because you don't you you're like going back on memory lane with coffee and you're left [laughter]\nSounds like he's making coffee over an open fire in the tea following how this goes on and I remember that you are now in tears men or something it was a looming I'm not as ... to light up and household but\nLet's get to a television or board actually what impresses me\nA about the TV report or the numbers that Lew watched Christine was they were aluminum you're right that Jennifer where they were little room yeah\nChristine Ford and Brett Kavanaugh twenty million people watching them as they testified\nLast week that's higher than the Nineteen million new tuned in for James Comey's hearing the numbers don't agree with the people who watched on their phones their computers that sort of thing CNN says that its biggest live video day since President Trump's inauguration eight million live starts on his website um\nI tell you I was using CNN go in my purse because I was I had to go buy some spank them and stuff for the wedding at that I was in the past weekend and I was listening as I was walking through the store at one of my headphones in my ear like a total idiot but\nI had to I wanted to hear it a lot of people did\nYeah people were and it was so funny 'cause I was in bed sick and I was watching it on a I guess it was NBC's coverage and neck and Kelly for whatever reason they had her on a panel and she was like you know no one's watching this and she kept saying over and over like no one cares about this like everyone's at work no one's watching this\nI saw her stay ... right like why are you saying that because you're on live t._v. first well that's ... that's the people are watching you feel like losers because\nThey're like one of ten people watching it was so weird that's like me saying well you know we're not going to do a very good radio show to you know and you're listening you know why I bought a let's see I Can't understand being wasted time uh I did not watch\nThese I got a bit little here and there are enough to make a conversational on the air on friday but uh there's nothing about this this is just uh I Know that a lot of you feel very close to it for whatever the reason a lot of women are very passionately involved in this woman and her story\nI feel badly for her frankly and it has nothing to do with the event as much as it does with the spectacle of the fact that she had the courage to get up I don't think she's an ax grinder I think that something happened whether it was with Kevin or not\nI find it interesting to note that are that the senator from Arizona\nWho's pretty much put the brakes and he was on sixty minutes last night was named flick right Jeff like uh-huh like yeah I thought he was credible became across will measured interesting he was supposed to deliver a speech today in Boston\nAnd they changed the venue because they were worried about bombs and attacks on him I\nDon't know where we are in this country\nBut I Do the right now people would want to attack him he's kind of see being seen as a hero of the Emerson College\nChain out the venue because of the attacks\nThen you have watched him over the weekend he got but he was at some I don't know what kind of festival here with that but something that was definitely a more liberal crowd and he went up and thought he was going to get himself a nice reaction and he got booed like a lot so um yeah I wouldn't be so sure that he's being looked at it as a hero public\nService does not pay any more much doesn't\nIt thought he was going to be a hero but I I well I don't know whether he I don't think he did it for that reason generally I didn't I didn't know the guy but I watched this body is is famously\nFrail is he's ... he's gonna primary tromp on twenty twenty mark my words it's not a Megan Kelly production he's going to primary chop he's ... he that's why he's leaving the Senate\nAnd part what part of the reasons why leaving the Senate if because he didn't have the votes to get reelected so he would have probably be gotten beat by a Republican challenger but he wants to run against Trump in that he ... the two that have been the the outspoken critics although if\nYou have kids voted with Trump like Ninety three percent of the time I voted with him here right well see I have to answer manner of speaking yeah\nIt's just more delayed delayed delayed but we'll see we'll see anyway TV news you're right yes yes we are still some new premieres this week and I'll tell you about those first because it is that's the exciting lead\nAnd I make a comment before you get a I watched as CBS last night looking for my favorite Sunday night programs from last year yeah\nThere's a there's nothing I watch a little bit of sixty minutes and there was some new show that was ridiculous about God and whether he says\nOh yeah God calls me or something ... me everybody and the only thing I saw\nAnd I didn't watch the whole thing because I found it so annoying the premise so annoying\nCaught rented me is actually the name of rented out at night yeah right uh but I found God is played by a Joe\nMorgan what's the guy's name he was the bad guy uh in um Olivia Pope wind what the heck Joe Morgan do\nHe played her father and he was really a bad guy you know what I'm Joe you're on the recognizer museum he's playing God and then the show [laughter] I ... I found that very very interesting this is a very good actors can play different kinds of roles so does that\nMake it bad or or now I just shot as\nWhat I wanted to see what does this stuff that I used to see on Sunday night and the only thing that was there was MCI yes madam secretary wasn't on they had some\nOther ... magnum PI which was a stupid remake of something that they should never be remains the same as like Hawaii Five o on steroids\nYeah they don't live five oh it's awesome I hear\nYeah but it's the same stuff is like the same shows him venue\nI think the white was magnum because MacGyver rebooting is working yeah anyway what else can we do right yeah right\nOkay I always do when I was ever [laughter] oh okay yeah yeah\nAll right that you hear that one that that's actually kind of looking forward to it's on CBS it's called the neighborhood it's got Cedric the entertainer in it and it's an all black neighborhood and max Greenfield who is a big the big TV star and that there is also from two broke girls are the white married couple that move into\nThe ... neighborhood oh let's just say okay so the whole\nThing [laughter] All right ... oh why kill them or you know like they were [laughter]\nYou got it that that she'll do tonight on CBS and the locked\nNow we're like Megan Kelly ourself here why would anyone watch TV don't listen to ...
