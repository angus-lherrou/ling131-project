these Middle Eastern countries\nOh George great to be with you\nHave things changed since the last time we talked about student loans doors they've gotten worse I bet\n[laughter] well yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse ah we're probably at it and I think I was about a year ago as we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab\nWhich is now a sitting officially in about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still there's a lot of loans that that don't get counted\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm going to walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman laws right if the school provides a you know if the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans [noise]\nUh but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of uh is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most\nUh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most apps and of the consumer protections but I just mentioned\nWhat what if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that the student in ah his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available\nThey get that discounted off their student loan that you know that's ...\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation or something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless\nYou are making a minimal a annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise] um [noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there\nBut I can tell you that what we have now today is the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen a you know the founding fathers way back in the day\nPeople like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants\nOr so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniformed bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war and the power to raise an army and many other very important powers\nAh so the ... you know they require bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student\nLoan ... we're going to take calls next hour with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition our\nSure oh well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to be able to repay the loan in other words to default on the loan they\nWant the default don't that's\nRight if it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead lots of defining hallmark of a predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies in the service or\nI Need a hallmark of predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies and the services and the guarantor ours are often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than a loan the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where\nYour credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default\nA but it turns out that ah the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm compelled to borrow or to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans they got a sixteen ... percent commission right off the\nWall so you\nKnow where they can make the three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for service you know healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four or five six years on a defaulted loans that they can build a bar or to put through rehabilitation\nAnd so the financial incentives that are under ... ... a federal student loans system are just completely perverted and it's been turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nKnowing explain the process of the defaulted loan in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let's let's use a student loan for your college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of\nAnd by any means so a student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nSure that's a that's a good case a good easy numbers to start with so a fifty thousand dollar student loan when the student graduates what say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years\nOr they're unable to make payments they lose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise]\nUm the student can expect a lot to be thrown into default\nSo the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably default it's somewhere around ... let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars what with penalties and fees and capitalized interests that are slapped onto that loan very quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty twenty\nFive years in the ball or is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment in fall for roughly let's say a hundred and twenty five or so thousand dollars\nOh my God so what the\n... what the lending system will do will say oh you're into falls on your loan\nBig trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment we can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nThat will be taxed too you stuff like that that's right yeah\nUm you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or\nSo ultimately they will wind up ... um hopefully the government hopes I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments for about a four ten months typically none of those payments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets\nOf these third party agents that ... this rehabilitation\nAnd at the end of the process they wind up signing for a much a new are much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars well these agents and get his sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that that compel them to do this alone rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nCheese and the ... these agents or collection companies\nWell yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's depends being charged ... systems agency [noise] ah and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well um these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own guaranteed horse so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would far rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than uh than alone there remains is good said I could probably say here George to all the people listening out there do not rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's\nThese defaulted loans that rehabilitate they default again three to four oh and they just keep growing\nOh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan if that default again\nAnd common sense to help people understand the good health and long life are rooted in proper nutrition not in toxic prescription drugs that

ways to conquer and slave nation one is by the sword and the other is by debt and you should have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is\nThey will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the sun's\nThen they become subject to arrest so in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and and forced to uh to come into court that way\nTo deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server the sheriff or private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nWill that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly a in just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise]\nUh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was like three thousand dollar loan and they hold this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know penalties interests in court costs and fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera um that's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know the uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison a that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy writes ahead of the power to declare war as far as an army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans\nThey all fifty thousand now they want to pay the fifty let's assume that's what they want to do but you're saying because of these defaults the fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that it grows even more can't they just cut a deal on the fifty\n[noise] well um they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it defaulted\nWhat kind of settlement is that for\nMost people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know if people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place\nUh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan default is free unrealistic for most people [noise] uh so you know the government has got you where do they want you on the student loans\nThey're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice dot org so many years ago you know I had worked in government lending in other areas and I had never seen anything like that\nOr you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um [noise] I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they want it to avoid this was the sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this is happening to will realize that you know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you saying that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there was about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to rescind revoked suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses and across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired a from this public employment and for the case of default is student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nDoes this cross a park party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what has President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\n[noise] it absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats or Republicans\nAre unfortunately the past say three presidents really have only made the problem worse under Obama Obama especially federal lives the lending programs so that we're before\nA bank such as those that I mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae cetera where they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans and by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five billion dollars a year which\nIs more than any corporation on earth on the lending program\nNow Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact\nThat the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before he said why is the government property not student loans this is nonsense you know of all the places that the government shouldn't be making a profit you would think student loans would be it\nA and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five\nYou know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those uh those days\nI'm so unfortunately you know Donald Trump's rhetoric was really good but since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him a et cetera so\nAnd just as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him a et cetera so who would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy device\nWho herself had stock in struggling collection companies [noise] ah and you know frankly I don't think President Trump is really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds\nOr so I have I hold out some hope for him a but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Nineteen Ninety eight you could a file bankruptcy and wipe out to students that what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um\nSome of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they tried it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away\nAnd so um so yeah Congress ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable [noise]\nWhat we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening far less than one percent in fact about three tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans in bankruptcy is less far less than the average for other loans\nSo there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights are and the fact that we've had to suffer under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing of ... this was a problem that Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against us citizens\nWere with Alan calling ... student loan justice dot org linked up and goes to goes damn dot com his book is called the student loan scam you're on some kind of a nationwide tour these days tell me what you doing\nOh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called H. are twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply um delete the one line of federal code that makes student loans treated differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings\nSo this really gets to the core of the problem and ah by by getting this bill passed\nA we would immediately see a dramatic decrease in the price of college\nUh we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality of the job that the government does administering the program a so this bill is very important and we're hoping very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nFree speech

I'm a conservative everyone knows\nThat I'm the guy that almost won I lost it for three split decision in the saddle case I'm pro life pro gun I'm a far right conservative it Rush Limbaugh and most of it's not even the liberals want a free hand out okay but the college tuition is technically and legally attack because there's money going to an arm of the state government college and were being over tax\nThat though it wasn't real it's a matter of fact the price of college is about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and here's the thing okay we spent a lot of money on our military\nAnd it it's too much really we spend a lot you know even at the conservative we spend a lot of money on Social Security but we can only ... those things a little bit\nThe um the third or fourth thing is probably the tax dollars are being used to make er Yankee college loans and we don't need to spend any money or that not only does it put the tax dollar on that hug and it's going to crash the dollar like Greece remains a whale of Georgia and I'm Alan by the way I'm Alan was good enough\nTo make me the leader of the Florida group and I hope I'm I he'd gotten on an equal talking a little too much [laughter] but it's an eye and all of\nThe reason is here's the deal OK almost ten percent of the total debt is college debt and and it's going to crash the dollar that the only thing if we get rid of the when the lab and get a credit card I'm okay with the loans but let them get a credit card it'll fade the tax dollar and it'll save the stint in college will drop like a rock\nAnd the I I Love I Love my rage man 'cause I'm a conservative and they provide jobs in hospitals and police looking here if we can get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get a look and he can get bankruptcy repeatedly for millions in bailout can handouts\nAnd have all these rich banker in these colleges can get rich on the standing looking here ... that that that those are the two beneficiary in here and\nThen okay and they use these are All right we got your point there ... Allen\n[noise] you know I I he said a lot there but I appreciate all those points and he's exactly right\nYou know if we can throw seven trillion dollars into Afghanistan and Iraq I think we can throw maybe a trillion her show at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view you know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow\nI think on balance that would probably be\nA good thing it would return prices back\nDown to rational levels uh and you know it would it would really clean out a lot of the sort of socialistic uh nonsense that's been allowed allowed to creep into the system but ... but ... but in particular it would it would lead to lower prices\nWill go to do with all the debt right now Alan would you are just a white dude clean\nWell I Will say that if you had a minimum bankruptcy protections are not restored so that people can go to a judge and according to the wisdom of the judge hum settled that debt according to their means if\nThat does not happen than we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a nonpartisan guy but I Will say that uh the Democratic socialist particularly in New York are starting to win elections on the promise of canceling all student debt\nAnd [noise] you know I don't think that is maybe the best solution because there are you know forty percent of the people out there\nAre able to successfully repay their loans but that is exactly what we're looking at very soon if at a minimum of the bankruptcy writes that the founders demanded aren't return\nSwollen you do have salaries teacher salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[laughter] yeah that's right um\nA return ball and you do have salaries and teachers' salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[noise] yeah that's right um you know my best estimate is that the colleges are so flush with cash right now there are so badly overcharging their students by and large\nThey could probably suffer eight thirty percent if not forty percent reduction\nIn the student loan income that they're currently receiving and still be able to keep their doors open not have to lay off one person a and you know be able to service all the students that they do today so I think there was a lot of capacity there for price reduction in academia um\n[noise] so yeah I mean ending the student loan program tomorrow would I agree probably be pretty devastating to a lot of schools [noise] um but certainly there's got to be a middle ground you know and with bankruptcy back with the department of education having to contend with the same bankruptcy laws that every other Linder has to contend with\nA that would go a long ways towards compelling them to crack the whip on the schools to lower their prices improve their quality and decrease the amount of time that the students are having to stay in school now to get a degree\nFirst time caller mark in Provo, Utah Marco head\nWell George you said they can't or they don't force you to take student loans but when I started school I was on a full scholarship they've been paid for my books but the federal government makes you go to a student loan counseling so I went and I told the\nLady I'm I don't know why I have to even be here among full scholarship and she told me Will Hunting if I were you I Would borrow as much as you can put it in the bank and earn interest on it oh boy I Would love to sue her this\nDid you end up doing that oh yeah and then life happens the money disappears yeah you know ... over fifty thousand dollars just in interest on my student loans and loan balance is a hundred and three thousand dollars just slight gallon ever pay it off I Will die owing money\nDo they harass you mark\n[noise] no I'm right now they've got me on some ridiculous thing where uh my payment is zero um I did a double major in a minor and some point I did need student loans but uh the irresponsibility\nUm I just I I Would have never tasted that crack had she not pedaled it\nRemains actually exactly well what do you think Ellen ... these loans aren't\nPushed on the students way ahead of any scholarship or any other um any other aid that where you don't have to pay back I mean the college and some of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them\nA private banks and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's it's just disgusting [laughter] hey you know I might actually add um the repayment program that that a mark is on a is probably the income based repayment program\nSo they're a bunch of government programs out there that sounds like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness there's income based repayment but what all everybody out there needs to know\nIs that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where you work for a you know if you work in a\nOr hospital other nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it\nSo the rest are being disqualified and they're being left owing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan so\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about a ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I'd be our program and actually get the loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income so\nTwenty five years you get a\nNice little thing that sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals are probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nDo the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know seeking to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nBig was going to say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nAh they have no public a benefit the inspiration they jettisoned all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nI Know about titled fraud so I register with home title walking discovered some these had already taken over

settlement with only knew anything about these student loans scam Ellen are the student loans that are out there now hurting or helping the economy\n[noise] [noise] well I I think it's clear that it's hurting the economy at this point uh you know interest alone on one point five trillion dollars\nMore than Ninety billion dollars a year or so that's money that gets taken away from home purchases or you know business formation\nA auto ... you know other ... big ticket items that improve the economy [noise]\nUh so certainly is hurting in that respect a and you know it's it's also hurting in a number of ways that are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people\nA straddle or you know strapped under ... this these sort of debt levels typically the sort of oppressive type of debt [noise] um this really can make people do bad things um you know make people do things for money that they wouldn't otherwise do\nI'm also forces a lot of people into the underground economy\nA and certainly those people will pay no taxes and and et cetera so so it's really hurtful in many ways that are maybe not a parent or to the naked eye\nLet's go to Paul Fresno, California to get things started here west of the Rockies ball go ahead sir\nHey I'm very grateful you think Michael thank you very much Georgia now them [noise] um I graduated from college to ... just before it closed down [noise] I'm I'm One of those fortunate case who are at one point three to aloe with talking about that actually got um most cars that were given\nI uh got thirty ... thirty seven thousand but I got you know that I owed\nForgiven wow how'd you do that and graduations\nI appreciate that thank you well I I did a little bit of an hour away\nOr there's something called a binding and what that is is that like a lifting of pretty much like a course of your book or a trait that trade you chose yeah and what it is is ah\nIf they are of course he'll uh the reason they're in a situation because they all like ... so if you were from a certain time period to a time period at the end of the school I'm pretty much that's when they committed a that\nBroad so it actually took me from I Would have to say December to ... to around August of two thousand uh fixing to get it all given\nWhat I did is I actually wrote Kamala Harris and email um she's a privately bonded um but uh the avenue that I went to go after give it to write a cover letter hum I submitted a pretty much what the government had to put a plenty on it and I had the pretty much just\nA political out there what I'd gone through no that that's the transcript\nTo a a cover letter transcripts and\nPretty much uh all the information that I actually had the group that I went to college\nYeah it was the fraud that that gun it reduced I guess right\nA yes or that's one of the main things I put there because if you see many of the college ... what the problem with this life long job placement of cooking [noise] so what how I false advertising\nYes exactly so when the schools shut down there goes your ball drop like there goes your life like long like but at the\nRight you got that right the interesting Alan isn't it\nYeah that you know and that's a good point and I maybe I should have brought up as some other point and show there are some breaking news now where if you went to\nParticularly for many of the for profit colleges they get caught or why you mean just like the just like Paul mentions\nSo they'll misrepresent their job placement rates and you know say oh you know average earnings for your degrees this much and these could be lies and so there actually is a rule that was put in place by the Obama administration where if your school ... ... you\nThen at least on paper you have available to you and avenue called defense to repayment where you\nAt least theoretically you can get your loans cancelled and I\nI think I'm Paul is probably one of the very lucky few that has seen does work successfully for him [noise] ah but I Will say that even just yesterday um [noise] one of the federal court struck down an attempt by the department of education to\nSort of do away and slow walk this this program so as it stands now today there's a bit more hope for people who are light to buy their colleges are then there was a a couple of days ago um now I Can't say for sure what the results of this will be\nBecause believe me the department of education has no desire or intentions of forgiving anybody's loans if it doesn't absolutely have to uh you know under gunpoint practically by the legal community but [noise]\nUm but there is a bit more hope today than there was before so if you're you were lied to by typically a for profit college or you may may may possibly have some avenue for record snow\nWhile you know with all these credit card fraud that's out there and just credit fraud indeed I mean if you get a letter from a collection agency for some debt you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy of the ... and they don't provide it to you they're up a creek aren't they\n[noise] well that's right and not necessarily for student loans we find a lot of a private loans the underlying note uh ... well first of all the loan has been bought and sold so many times that whoever says they owned a note actually doesn't\nLoans the underlying note uh well first of all the loan has been bought and sold so many times that whoever says they owned a note actually does not owned a note and they have no business collecting on that loan I'm\n... now there are other there are some avenues that the lenders can go to they can\nSay that the new it was lost and they have other avenues to prove their does have valid no but that's certainly is something to be aware of\nAnd I should also say people who have private student loans are not federal student loans they do have statute of limitations so somebody comes up to Twenty years hence and starts demanding money from you for a private loan than\nAlmost certainly that loan is not\nLittle ... little suspect\nUm and you want to look into the statute of limitation laws that govern that particular alone depending on where you live or where you took up alone\nIt's going to pat Minneapolis east of the Rockies Hi go ahead\nI worked in a Social Security office for a while and I figured out that at ... at least one of the agenda is is\nThe destruction of the Social Security program because there are families with co signers\nGrandparents parents and still none of them are ever going to get a security forum I Want a question and that suggests ... All right if if I own a house and I can find on one of these student loans\nIs that does that blame that on my house so that when I die instead of my air is getting at it's collected for a for a student loans\nThat goes to the lone first doesn't it\nWell that's a that's a great question hum to her first point\nYes Social Security wages are being garnished as we speak for student loans and what is even more disturbing I see legislation out there right now it hasn't passed yet\nBut I see legislation out there right now which offers a loan forgiveness in ah in return for people for going their Social Security when they when they reach retirement age ah so there are some people at work in Washington DC very busy trying to figure out how to\nTake away Social Security benefits down the road from student loan borrowers\nInteresting is that what did you have one other thing that your\nFamily is already where multi generation the grandparents and parents and the kids are never going to get any Social Security\nBut my question is that if you have if you want to help US Steel and tear up the LAT you write a check to the school or a money order or other travelers check or whatever and all and the kid brings yet you know says well here's my transcript for the last semester you want to help me this semester", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "18"}
