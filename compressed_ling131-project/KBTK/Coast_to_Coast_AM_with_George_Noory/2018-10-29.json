I. B. movies where the ... the actors playing the very human agents mentioned how all the real news all the good stories get reported first in the tabloids\nSort of hinting that did the agents and agencies are the ones who leak or plant crazy wild stories about the paranormal\nGive them to say the weekly world news it's kind of funny stuff but is it true or could there be\nAgencies government entities that tried to influence public perception of these topics monitor these subjects watch and spy on those who've had experiences listen to the phones foam around mess with their heads\nThe answer is yes and they read burners put together a new project that pulls together far flung examples and government documents to make the case that it's true it's called top secret alien abduction files and that's what we're going to talk about in this hour we'll be right back [noise]\nA public opinion is that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom ...\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is our first book flying saucers have landed published in the early fifties that that sold in huge figures are gigantic numbers of books with salt\nI'm On a ski went on the lecture circuits are all around the country\nAnd he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly had this sort of a communist type\nOf governments um the communism was the way of the future and the FBI open that file honor dams skate um predominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ... bucks\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by the communist angle and I'm\nA number of the the contact chase I've sort of similar approaches for example to again in the u._k. and you have the theory of society created by George king that was closely watched\n'em by the British a police force because I'm\nGeorge King various society but very much I'm On the nuclear weapons I'm so falls were opened on them so in other words you asked me have files opened on the contact taste but predominantly because they have this political slams a in many of their claims\nBuddy the important thing is\nThe end of the day what it boils down to the FBI and the other agencies were opening surveillance files on people who claimed close encounters um wave nonhuman entities\nYou hit a record in the book that's coming out first of November 'em up secret alien abduction while you were something that I had read before it's about a brief famous case\nA ... ... ... ... this is an abduction cases in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female and uh I'd never heard this new explanation but it takes government surveillance two older level that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean they the conventional aspect if you can call it a conventional\nUm aspects of the story goes back to the fifties and he's a famous case uh from Brazil where these young man named Antonio Novello spouse claim to fame taken on board a UFO and as you said he had sex with these beautiful looking um alien woman\nAnd I'm I'm fraud tens of ... he was taken on board against these will so he was abducted you know it was an alien abduction case\nUm we didn't you follow gee you know it's hard to perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of town of ... all you know it was a really weird aspects of the phenomena and now there's this little I'm known aspects of to the story\nIt was a really weird aspect of the phenomena and\nNow there's this little I'm known aspect to the story or which places an entirely different slant on it until\nNow if you read carefully Antonio ... a report that he put together for um a Brazilian a UFO researcher and a doctor named ... tests\nUm he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board\nUm came down and he started to feel weird to see the pain drugs somehow and he said he was taken aboard base craft which he described as being sort of long rectangular\nAnd um he had like something on TALK like a dish that was spinning around very fast\nAnd he was making the Beijing noise\nAnd that kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the shape they the spinning disk on top the roaches and debating noise\nSays like the classic Saturday you get with a helicopter now a man came forward um in the late Nineteen seventies but his story didn't get very much a publicity its name was ... and he had ties to the CIA and various other agencies\nAnd um he told a race or a year for research rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um they the abduction was a fabrication and that's going but it really did evolve a helicopter\nBut by talking to ... um ... failed lights at night\nThey released some sort of aerosol loose majestic aerosol er which incapacitated and choking on board the helicopter and that they a woman was rarely that and the power was played out\nUm but he is in that sort of at all to state wasn't sure what was going on and that was ... ceremony asleep dumped back on the ground\nAnd they the favorite of the story was but the agencies within governments that might well if a rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine how bad the fifties while the CIA eyes\nAnd ... and things like base the plan was to try and determine\nTo what extent the human mind to appeal to it and you know in other words if we can convince people that can say I aliens we can convince them and anything that\nWas ... when he came down to so metal ... claim that um\n[noise] but they they the abduction if you like was played out\nAnd buy kind of just then sat back and wait to to say how much of the story was taken and I went I realized that the story of being embraced by you follow Jay and it was a parenting books it was the case of a job well done and\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples of these are pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal targets to think that it's it's something beyond just some alien presence that there's military or government involvement\nYeah I mean they should make it gets confusing if they you know throughout January and alien abductions and then you have agencies fabricating them to try and determine how the human mind\nCan be altered and they use the UFO angle is the ... to try and you know um to see how it works on paper doesn't work so you know it gets really confusing when the cookie rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a following them around listening to the phones but not investigating the abductions themselves the phenomena itself or are they doing both and just not feeling\nWell yeah I think there's good evidence that it's um it's actually both because it's somebody abductees that I spoke with said that they found a number of occasions I'd actually paying visited by military personnel and it wasn't like a a traumatic threatening at my base situation it was more\nOf these military personnel were actually approached should be up to taste quietly\nRequesting that I didn't talk about their experiences and some of them didn't send some of them have but they basically they ... it was as if the military were asking questions\nUm along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why this is being done so in other words they were trying to get to the heart of what the abductions where why that were being done\nBut in other cases there is good evidence also of um surveillance of the of the duct tape a good example\nAnd somebody um it was tied to coast to coast I'm ... I'm Greg tell me how um he had to pay to correspondents in the Nineteen nineties a duck to call at China who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was an ap duct tape herself\nAnd Greg told me how you know back in the early nineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all of the lectures that I wrote to each other back and forth were opened and sailed back down with type\nAnd um now these can clearly be done you know a family without making it look like the ... I was taught to open a race failed\nIt was almost as if whoever was doing base wants to Greg and college and I know that someone was opening their mail in other words he was sort of like an intimidation hey you know we're watching it and that went on you know for for quite a period\nA Greg is working tonight at our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it I mean there are a lot of people in the you up all the old who you know are not as credible is Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm\nAnd I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt that if you have a traumatic experience like an alien abduction then I think sometimes people can become sort of paranoid of every little thing in their life you know and which is a dangerous road to go down\nUm but in saying that I mean another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I I think many papers associate them with ...\nI'll tell you what were let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side do save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions that we got some other ground to cover before then we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons I Seventy one\nDeer and other other kinds of creatures but a kennel or the the ones we know best that have been publicized most I Can't imagine what the total dollar amount of losses for the livestock bosses ranchers and farmers could be but it's pretty substantial\nAnd when you look at how the government has responded the FBI\nHad some ... agents who looked at it a very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and in combined with the black helicopter phenomena that you discuss in this book\nWell yeah I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and um he's clearly a real one um they just seem to be tied to both capital immunity relations and um [noise]\nThe Eileen abduction phenomena and one of the things that's as being no taste and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these whoever's flying these helicopters\nPotentially I think is part of an organization that up right outside of government you know my actually it may sort of do research and work for the government\nBut it's not you know like the CIA or anybody like that fly madly cup does I don't think I think it is sort of um [noise] you know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program designed to do the work\nAnd in most faith in government don't know anything about it at all because you might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government itself you know it might have been even\nSort of ... to private corporations which again would make it more difficult to get material for the fate Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by\nAh by the fate of information request\nSo in that sense I think you know the the phenomenon these rail and I think whether it's ... or abductions\nThe Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out what's going on you know there there's so many cases of black helicopters and an ... helicopters\nTurning off the homes sometime precariously there the homes of alien abduction ... and and again kind of light with color to enter and Greg they\nMight be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abduct taste um and be able to to respond at high speed if in in the\nEvent that they that the papal climatic options were actually able to catch an ad abduction going ahead you know in the ... so that very time\nSomebody who's ... tuning in tonight for the first time has to think we're all crazy alien abductions cattle mutilation black helicopters and we're saying yeah the stuff happens\nBut the files that you've obtain from US government from the u._k. government sheds light on these things and someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is that there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on in their agencies different agencies and government small groups of people who are\nLooking at this but really don't have answers about who's responsible and why this stuff happened\nWell yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what\nRight and she knows a you know many many cases agencies\nHave the information to themselves and less than they used to be shed and if we'd ailing waived I just had a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to a private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more difficult\nBut I mean in terms of the files on the um\nOn the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages\nI'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol ...\nI'm a wave of and cancers that occurred in Seventy five and some of the the ... of and I'm bored of the United states and in the latter part to Seventy five\nAnd I'm just various other case including some from the ... when there was a wave of activity of UFOs in Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas\nSo I think we're seeing a pot and and and I think the violence and intimidation a sort of the the mine coal and cause the you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences or to literally physically real or not it it's tough to to even though there are some really well documented cases it's tough to figure it out it's tough to figure out what\nSomeone else is looking for when they put people through this stuff you mentioned you bring up bombs are in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there was a film coming out about those are it'll be the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the germ ... going to come out in December and then there's a book that's going to be published I think after the first year and a lot of interest in the case with your angle was kind of an interesting one on\nHow it fits into the whole abductee aliens scenario\n[noise] well yeah I mean you know was our story is always intrigued me a lot of people dismiss you are right but one of the things I've always found about this law is unlike a lot of pain flu hoax things\nThat you follow gee you know when this story runs out of feel um you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the lecture circuit and so on\nUm you know I I and I think the big difference we'd lives oh is he never embroidered on the ... the original story be told as it was never expanded on it he tells the same ... years ago he hardly try to put himself\nStory be told as it was he's never expanded on it he tells the same stories a Thirty Years' ago he's hardly try to put himself at the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and\nHowever many you know dollars and so forth it doesn't you know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story it doesn't come across like your average ... so that's one of the things it's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections\nAre between the abductions\nAnd paypal who claimed that in some way or another they the the graze the idea in Gray's who Joe the abductions that somehow I have this\nDay and sort of sinister and disturbing interest in the human soul 'em and they sort of ties in with ... when he climbed that's um he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read I Would ask for this this portion of very fifty while he was working at allegedly\nAnd um he said that would be the Iranians or whatever they are viewed us as containers and or any speculated on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the ... had some sort of obsessive interesting in the human cell\nAnd one of the things I talk about in the book is\nI'm a number of abduct tastes who were approached climbed dastardly by these military agencies\nAre private corporations I'm Still ask questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you bought a fuel cell leaving your body um\nDid you have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of\nDo child wave the story that was always telling as well\nYou know you you look at recent developments in regard to the UFO topic in general\nAnd of course we've been told in Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force they stop project ... book they're not studying it is no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking on course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but\nThat was the cover story and and now we've learned last ten months that wasn't true but there were on going studies that were more than one in fact that they were collecting information on what seems like you know presumably is ridiculous\nUm in light of the kind of ... that you bring up in this book where there's surveillance and there's counter intelligence and there's um you know just information and things that sort\nOf do you have concerns about the recent revelation I I Would think that people who are suspicious sooner weary of this you know they there's some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know it it is such a confusing angle George you know they ... they sign glove um rail abductions fabricated abductions the surveillance the government itself trying to get its had around what's going on\nYou know you put all this together and um\nYou know ... it really is sort of a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what isn't so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um\nAnd again that's why you know went on the way I've written a book is to demonstrate what we know the says you know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency may be doing this why might they be fabricating\nAnd abduction events but then\nAt the same time also investigating a legitimate events you know it's it's it's not ... now where um\nYou know being a just black and white you know it it's the the lines of really blood in trying to figure out what the overall goal is but there but there is no doubt at all that you know that there is sort of extensive um

that the current scientific paradigm tells us that when we die that's it that's the end at the many of the experiences that people report over the centuries things that happened to them for real or

ways that are probably inappropriate and unfair and also possibly dangerous is there a way to reconcile\nThe seemingly bizarre experiences that people have reported through the centuries out of body experiences missing time time slips near death encounters other realities of science versus spirituality science and religion is their way to bridge all of that well Dr Christopher white has written a remarkable new book\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers on in the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really the nineteenth century mathematicians raise this possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth spatial dimensions that the the mathematics of the universe is a laws enforces look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just to skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even that six Seventeen and more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are\nYour members every audience have heard of string theory but\nSure yeah I'm using so yes string theory M theory brain theory so these these were basically mathematical theories that incorporate these other dimensions 'em and they do it again in order to\nMake make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern from the universe their string theorists in um\nTheoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the biggest problem in modern physics and the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seem to govern reality um and we know that both sets the equations are correct but we also know that they don't fit\nTogether we have\nWe we have we have a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and I'm like governor governor subatomic world with the er the atomic world world of quantum and we know those equations work you know the correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement hum\nOf the of the very large so planets and sons and galaxies and San I'm a ...\nA series of general relativity we we know both of those sets of equations are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorist and others are assuming that there are additional spatial dimensions\nAnd they're using them in order to come up with a single set of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together the other the other equations that we have it's\nBetween sort of the ... version and the ... version you have things like spooky action at a distance or which scientists have struggled to explain and tangled theory right\nAbsolutely absolutely yeah I mean you know a mathematician who who work on on these subjects\nI'm also have to wrestle with other mysteries right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know they're they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem of having two sets of equations that don't fit together\nAnd they're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other strange and uncanny on implications of of quantum physics that um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and and ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I\nIn physics that uh that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and and ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I try to talk about that in the book as well right and the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is about scientists who work on these ideas but then I'm\nA scientist who don't have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who who have religious experiences and start to talk about them is higher dimensional or somehow related to some some concepts and says X\nOr maybe we could use flat land as an illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land and I guess it was a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nYeah absolutely yeah filing with a great little book um so ... kind of a classic science fiction or nonfiction book written a long time ago a written an Eighteen eighty four thirty\nHas quite a cultural life and in fact I remember reading flatland in high school calculus so ... you know math students all over the world still read flatland as a way of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live and uh the kinds of spaces and kind of mentioned we live in so\nThat's a great little book written by an Anglican priest named Edwin Abbott\nHe was British she was she was raised in the middle of the nineteenth century I'm coming to come into age in a\nIn an era of science and wrestling with what it meant to be religious and scientific at the same time um you know it was a time you know this Eighteen fifty nine was found origin of species and there were a number of um there were a number of\nChallenges I guess you'd say to Christianity and Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing the ... wonderful book flat land which is a book about a lower dimensional to mention the world and he wrote it in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of world could exist um embedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe\nBut habits flat world with a with a two dimensional world the book takes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this was a world that's completely flat and it's populated by\nTwo dimensional objects as objects which just lengthen with some of them were flat square some of them were black circles are flat triangles and and even even lines they would all slide around on the surface of this flat world\nAnd of course they believe that uh they lived in a two dimensional world until the climax until the climax of the of the novel when\nA three dimensional object a sphere inserts itself goes down in in ... in search itself into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks\nOut on his his ... sees the appearance of this mysterious object you start talking to him and the sphere says I'm you know I I'm I'm a three dimensional object and I come from another another world and the first says this can't be possible\nIn the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're flat a two dimensional world is better than a larger world so the sphere resorts to a more um extreme measure any he reaches over and pull the square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and\nOf course the than the square looks around and looks down on his flat world that can for the first time the the whole world spread out in front of them so that's where it becomes a sort of a believer\nIn the existence of a higher dimension that there's a there's a third dimension and he goes back\nTo his flat world of course and it's pretty enthusiastic about this and can't can't stay quiet about it and unfortunately in in flatland it's forbidden it's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of hired mentioned so he put in jail where he\nWhere he stays for a number of year years and and the story ends\nWith us for flat square languishing in prison I'm\nHoping that by his readers ... some of his readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be more than meets the eye to their reality so he sort of\nLike the idea that the high priest a flat land wouldn't allow or anybody to talk about the other dimension I'm In a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah yeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interested in commenting on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived right the sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild thoughts but ah but the square character did have these wild often and I even have the stationary experience right where he saw that there was\nThat there was another space or direction to reality and and I'm so happy I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to think about the possibility that above our three spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um\nThat we don't see we go through our life um you know thinking that our world is the only world\nBut you know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about and want to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and\n... it gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I can tell you what we're going to we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it and as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment are talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions ah the doors re going through that go into the break\n\nDown where George Nouri speaking ... website and scroll down to the bottom and you're just doing what are\nYou\nThe religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and [noise] he was mayhem\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality I Am headed into an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make [laughter] All right in the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a\nAnd he kinda hangs onto that as the only sure thing that was way in which the math provide certainty 'em to him so I think his his uh stories a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nAs I say in the book he develops the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nAnd then he starts to think you know well what if these what if these mathematical variables in my equation you know these ... these higher dimensions but I'm using what\nIf they actually have a real existence somehow um you know what if the math points to the real existence of these kinds of\nSpaces and he he thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he develops of way of what he thought of as sort of re educating the senses in order to catch glimpses into this\nInto the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating the senses that involves um no it involves a sort of twenty seven cubes that are labeled a all twenty seven are labeled and they're stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube you know that three by three by three\nUm and he and then he he memorize the positions of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then he'll uh and then he'll rotate a Rubik's Cube and then he'll memorize all those positions\nIt's essentially sort of an imaginative\nUm exercise but he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive beyond the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues ... shook their heads I think ah [laughter] you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while but\nHe didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um and doing the research but instead he he was doing things like putting this this uh this cue these cubes sets together and helping coach the Princeton baseball team and he actually he actually also invented a pitching gotten which was one of the first\nUm um you know automated pitching devices on ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure Princeton [laughter] he uh he didn't do what he what he should have been doing that he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular books and articles about this idea that\nYou know that there may be higher spatial dimensions and and these [noise] you know our ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to a new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are\nSeeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nWell as you document and trace I mean the this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you've got the yeah the mistakes and I I Would think con men and religious leaders who grab onto what do they all use this idea for their own purposes\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of\nUm as as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife or heaven and so on and so I'd hindrance ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course it's flat land both on both of their um [noise]\nYou know their writings really become important so modern artists take up these ideas or spiritual writers take up these ideas a lot of religious people are in the U.S and then in Europe take these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another person in the book chapter seven\nChapter eight is is cs Lewis right which I'm ... who I'm sure many of your listeners have heard of cs Lewis Narnia the fame\nFame famous British a Christian I'm Christian apologist and Christian writer probably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer he uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he incorporates ideas about higher dimensions to rethink Christian ideas such as the trinity um and he\nHe incorporates them in a number of sermons ... and and his writings and then of course many people are familiar with the scent fantasy writings and the same ideas around there as well he's got he's got references higher dimensions and um and he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested in them spiritually\nTo you know he he was he was raised in the church but then he becomes an atheist\nOr like many like many characters in my book actually um he goes off to war and becomes disillusioned there's a number of people in there you know precisely in there and James ban it and\nI'm a number of people go off to World War one or World War two in the book and they have that they get into combat situation OJ W diamonds and they're also also in combat\nThings hip and ear and out of body experience right\nRight exactly a number of those people have these kinds of experiences that really shake them to the core and cause them to sort of rethink a reality and rethink religion and for\nSome of them those war experiences disillusioned them and turn them off from religion but others are like like James Bennett\nA he has this kind of out of body experience right but I talked about in chapter six um which is a chapter really about dreams that seem to predict the future I'm kind of a kind of a cool chapter I really like a chapter\nEx um which is a chapter really about dreams that seem to predict the future I'm kind of a kind of a cool chapter I really like a chapter on so he has this out of body experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how mathematics and science and especially the science of higher dimensions how that might help explain what happened to him\nWell let's talk about dreams a little bit I explain it to me how it held this would work how the idea of dreams are they coming from somewhere else higher reality another reality\nYeah yeah yeah the rates are fascinating and um your dreams seem to be important in just about every culture around the world um you know and in many cultures people have dream interpreters you know a special people who\nAre you tell your dream to and then they tell you what it means um and we have that in our culture too right we have all kinds of ah [laughter] we have all kinds of dream interpretation books and we have people like the Swiss psychotherapist Carl young who many people know about who\nIs is really important for people as they think about interpreting their dreams and so you have other people have long thought about the spiritual meaning of of dreams and in my book uh especially in that chapter six\nPeople are also wondering about the the spiritual meaning of dreams [noise] um [noise] in that book uh there's a figure who is his name is Jay W done who was a British\nAeronautical engineer also a soldier and and goes into combat and the second bowler war in South Africa right around the turn of the twentieth century he's he's in combat and Nineteen oh too\nAnd he starts to have dreams that\nDoes that surprise him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams are then seem to happen in real life so he has\nHe has predicted dreams or ... what are sometimes called pre cognitive dreams he has dreams that seem to predict the future\nAnd these these surprise him I'm like I said they they do begin\nIn as he's camped out uh with his with his platoon so they they seem to begin in combat situations and he started having them and he at first he wandered if he was maybe going insane I'm from the stress I'm In a battle and these kinds of things but you would have dreams\nAnd then he would wake up generally what happened was he would have dreams and then you wake up and the next day or the day after that or the day after that he'd open the newspaper and see the event in the newspaper so one one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his book\nHe has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking down the hill towards the ocean and he's obviously on an island\nRecognizes the island as as an someplace he's already been in his dreams he noticed is that there's cracks and fissures in the ground and the decisions are venting gas on the ground is rumbling people seem to be going about their business they're speaking French\nBut he's panic and he's\nHe's he's trying to alert people he's he knows that something's going to go wrong he knows it's going to be volcanic eruption so he's running around trying to get people's attention he doesn't speak French they don't seem to speak English he ends up talking to one official after another official after another no one really believed him and he ends up waking up and kind of a sweat in a panic\nAnd then a couple of days later he opens up the newspaper and he reads about this a catastrophic volcanic eruption and the island that Martin ... the French speaking island that Martin me\nUm and several of the details from his dream or correct um and some of them aren't some of them aren't as well and he tries to think um you know how could this be how could how could in in my dream pocket I've seen an event that hasn't happened\nA reason for war and we used to agree on the bill of rights do we anymore we either choose the constitution we do and we have\nGlenn Beck on money on one [noise]\nRumble

of higher dimensions to talk about what they experience\nI'm not to say on says the same category but you do a address say on this and the people's attempts to reach out to\nHire a hour or an another world um [noise] you know what's\nGoing on with those folks are they is there any legitimacy to that or do you not want to pass judgment on\n\nYeah I don't know um you know it's funny it's funny writing a book like this because you know I've never had any of these experiences [laughter] I've never had a dream that seemed to predict the future um you know I've never had an out of body experience right or or some of the um some of the experiences I've talked about so\nYou know I Know deja vu I have had deja vu for sure yeah yeah\nSo in the book I Try to talk about a lot of experiences that other people are happy and um\nYou know and I try to put them play their voices and and how they understand what's happening [noise]\nUm but I don't I don't know about San says you know I I wouldn't rule it out as being as being possible you know I mean I think that I mean if one thing\nIf this book taught me one thing it would be that I think that the the world is is a much more complex and ah and amazing really that than we now uh you know I think there's much more to the universe than meets the guy um\nYou know I I I Do believe that a man and I think we know that from science I mean when you when you look at these are these business is a cosmologist and read their\nRead their narratives about the universe read they're popular science publications I mean there's just there's more to the universe than meets the eye and so I really wouldn't rule out um spirits are ghosts are all those kinds of things you know I\nI I wouldn't be so arrogant as to as to you know sit here\nLoud I'm spirits are ghosts are all those kinds of things you know I I I wouldn't be so arrogant as to as to you know sit here and say oh you know you definitely there's no way that anyone could have an experience like that um\nSo I guess I Would just remain open to the open to those possibilities\nAnd you know I think what people would want to know is a is there a higher dimension that happened that would happen and if so do we go there and do we live live on beyond this\nYeah yeah right that's another big question that I Try to raise in the book the book has all of these big questions um\nYou know and and I don't answer that question in the book I think that's another question like your question about spirits and goes and found says I'm I'm certainly open to the to the possibilities are and and personally I I I Do believe that there is a nother world that we go to after this world me personally I Am I'm a believer you know I'm\nI Do believe in God and I do believe in spirit so I think I'm I think I line up more on that side of things with a kind of an openness to these different possibilities and like I say in the book I Try to put different voices in there who have different opinions and the reader kind of decide what they're saying you know I'm\nTrying to think about what causes a bunch of folks on the phone to talk to you know east of the Rockies Moses in

Texas the morning Charles\nGood good morning a and that is definitely the more you're kind of get laid off but anyway my um\nMy question well I have I tried to narrow it down as much as a kid or you know for I guess for Don stake [noise] ah ... but it just really this is sort of an issue where you can't really narrow things down this way and and\nReally we're going to narrow it down 'cause in two minutes we're going to go to a break so\nWell anyway I I guess I could ask this question I don't know if you've ever read that J. D. priest leaves on national Christopher here and if you've ever read the pre sleaze or sort of a big essay\nOn um it's called man in time it was published along with a with a lot of young books as having some wonderful\nBook you have to great bucks yeah yeah oh oh oh good so you have read it will very good well I think you can say about it I'm the one of the biggest issues I been happening is that as with the I guess we're still says the particularly you seem to still be attached to it gets in the anthropology of physics it never really\nExamine they're\nThat they're sort of preconceived their prejudices that come from their ... says this is life I suppose\nUh uh toward a about time about the issue of of time and and you know sort of what it is how it arises how would it can be even a fundamental dimension\nOf our ah reality you know and also the whole perception or not this this time but uh I mean\nI when I look at things in a quantum level we ... we see that everything is everything is is a sort of waves and I mean of course people don't even have like waves are frequencies or by the time becomes very essential 'cause it just the existence of matter\nThat you do an art project or a perception of it anyway so I mean there's just\nA anyway they don't have any comments or thoughts about yeah\nThank you Charles appreciate the call\nYeah that's that's a great question and that's a that's a wonderful book come J. B. Priestley I talked about in chapter six quite a bit he's a fascinating character I'm a very famous British writer playwright and twentieth century and BBC broadcaster\nHe gets really I'm interested in higher dimensions um he reads Hinton who he talked about he reads Jay W done who have talked about 'em and he'd comes up and developed his own theories\nInterestingly Priestley like some of the other figures in the book has a combat experience he also fights in World War one and a young person and as um as an injured [noise] um and he also has some\nHe also has some unique experiences of feeling like he's out of time or feeling like he's out of the body and then he writes this great book that the caller mentioned are called man and time um\nAnd in the book he has all kinds of testimonials from people who have written to him about their pre cognitive dreams ether dreams that seem to predict future events um he actually gets on the BBC\nIn Nineteen sixty two sixty three can't remember\nAnd he he asked the the viewing audience to writing letters if they've ever had an unusual time experience as they've ever slipped out of time if they've ever had a dream that predict the future and\nUh he got over Fifteen hundred letters um from from the from the viewing audience the let many of the letters are still extent this still at the University of Bradford I've been married to read through all the letters and I I incorporate\nA number of something in my book especially I Will be a Christopher white will take a break we are talking about other worlds with Chris white and a Tom Petty things as into the break we'll get to more of your calls and questions in a moment\nYou have faith and people and our culture and hair styles and it's just lovely have you ever tried the fraction exercises\nYeah no I I've never tried reflection of exercises although in my book I talk a bit about um [noise] and actually some classes I teach at Vassar College I talk about meditations on reflective surfaces so you know there's\nThere's even iPhones crying you know I don't know if you've heard that word is crying before but that is sort of meditating on a reflective surface that could be a computer screen or television screen or reflective water or a crystal ball or a number of different services but I Know that that is a spiritual and and visionary practice that a number of people use\nIn order to you know what what we say reach a higher consciousness or um [noise] yeah so that sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nWhat Marcia I just wrote that down I'm going to give that a try next year the suggestion dollar [laughter] everything from the idea right east of the Rockies Michael in Connecticut I might go\nOr what happened to me is I uh I started writing the ... of a dream journal [noise] and I I wrote a dream that my mother's husband who was dead was gonna give me a car at home is a money [noise] so [noise]\nI didn't believe it was going to happen but it did happen and I'm now drive and his car and I got the money to show it was very strange to me that a dream I wrote it down with him with a date on it and everything and it came true like months later [laughter]\nYeah yeah that's right yeah there's a\nThere's a whole technique that GW done talks about in his book experiment with time that I talk about in my book about dream journal and how to do it and it sounds like\nYou did that you know you keep a journal there you have a dream you get up you write it down right away and and um keep a whole journal and and think about your dreams and he believed that you know like you you believe everyone would start having these experiences where they would see these glimpses um glimpses into the future and the dream so that's that's a cool experience\nThank you Michael for sharing a wildcard line Joe in Monterey, California good morning Joe\nGood to good evening George I'm I was about to ask your guest if he ever meditative but I\nThought that it might be better if I introduce another concept to him as a what they call a super conscious mind\nI'm not I'm In remote viewing remote few and it has it's drawbacks this is um this is a mental where this is a mental travel or sold travel but it's also in a higher state of Seoul travel the call super conscious mind and you can access these high of world\nUm I Do this with my clients and are they going to these different worlds for different reasons whether it's hailing whether it's neat a loved one of the other reasons um it's an extremely um complex\nA multi verse and there's so many different beings how they're doing so much so many different things\nI was wondering if he ever a considered also a kind of um higher shelf of remote of writing is a is not like you're writing automatic because that automatic writing is really listening to your higher shelf as I call it like taking dictation\nAnd all it does all you need to do is go into like an alpha state or a trans state and just start writing but listening to your thoughts not thinking but listening to what comes to you and after a short time it will start to come out and you'll be channeling your higher shelf\nYeah yeah I liked that comment because it reminds me of um [noise] you know sometimes the way that people talk about higher dimensions of it as a as a dimension of consciousness right ... and you definitely have the\nTwentieth century psychologist and Carl young and many others um you know when we talk about there being three spatial dimensions to our world and if there was a fourth direction or dimension where would that be some people say well if it's going in you know it's not going out somewhere it's going to end\nThat consciousness sort of um occupies the the throat a new direction um\nAnd yeah through meditative practices\nI think it is possible to to access those both mentioned um you'd asked if I meditate I Do meditate you know I Do sort of mindfulness meditation and I definitely get into a\nRight into the zone where you feel sort of peaceful and quiet and calm I haven't had any visionary experiences of all meditating it's much more\nMuch more mundane unfortunately but um [noise] but I Do I Do meditate um and and do some of those practices and in my book I talk about others who have these kind of visionary meditative practices uh sounds like what you do\nNext job for the call you know you read about the musicians and writers who suddenly get inspiration from just out of the blue McCartney has written about you know writing yesterday you woke up with it in his hand yeah or or or other songwriters entire songs\nJust out of the blue ... you have written about you know writing yesterday you woke up with it in his hand yeah or or or other songwriters entire songs already written it came from somewhere else\nYeah and you talked and you talked to scientists about scientific creativity and scientific convention and many scientists will have the same kind of stories some of them will talk about dreams some of them will talk about other forms of inspiration some of them will say that these ideas came from somewhere else and I don't know where they came from\nSome of them will talk about different there's ... there's different layers of consciousness um\nSo I think there's a lot of mystery isn't there\nA Gordon in Lakeland,

I don't know if you know ... ... and stuff I'm I'm young I'm communion or he actually has a new book I'm I'm On the subject as well but he he talks sort of like you do I mean he he also wonders um what's the relationship is between\nAlien abduction and extraterrestrials on the one hand versus um spirits and goes on the other so he I think Whitley has come to this come to believe that there's there's a connection um and it sounds like you you've come to believe that as well but there's a\nThe connection somehow you know maybe the part of the spirit um our aliens or aliens are depart spirits\nAnd do we think we explore the idea of a unified theory of weirdness on the program a Chris I'm looking for connections and you'd be amazed how many scientists or\nA behind the scenes are interested in those kinds of subjects as well whether there's a connection do you look at the idea of the universe the many worlds theory and you talk about it in your book of course that wasn't that long ago that that would have been too far out for just about any of them to accept the now it's it's not all that a controversial anymore\nIsn't that crazy yeah it's really crazy I mean yeah and there's a number of ways of thinking about a a world or a universe with many worlds right I mean you mentioned the many worlds theory quantum mechanics and there's of course also the the multiverse idea right the multi burst ideas that there's\nYou know I'm a large number or an infinite number of other universes in addition to our visible universe and you know I um I Believe now that that's a

understand it um you know when you get reports of say a big foot by Michigan a flash of light\nOr you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing it makes me think

possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has changed into a wet well from a regular person you know that sort of all the\nThe Hollywood imagery but the fact is that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that same have the ability to walk on to limbs unfold limbs um I've got a lot I get a lot of reports like that but I never got to reports\nOf someone you know literally shape shift the like in America we have all the London or anything like that\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that\nThe the locations where they dug man type creatures have said anything ... very often these\nAncient burial marathons um Native American land um some of the the the mysterious all mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to set and locations is intriguing rather than just saying that random\nYou had one where will taste that was from a military base it's not ancient either it's more recent times remember that yes\nYeah they show us I'm at a British a bicycle royal Airforce how to break and uh actually it was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was I'm\nActually an American guy but it's working a Elvis Asia or you can break in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of ... which had\nI'm an American presence there was a high to the Cold War and he he swore that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ...\nAnd would have sort of kind of look like a big foot taught ... was it not for five that just face to face was very different\nTo how you would describe a knife and it was more like a lung muzzle with point today is very much like a\nA German Shepherd so if you imagine sort of a big body with a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um you know I didn't see any reason why he should you know create a story like that will fabricate the story like that he was um\nI was able to confess I mean he's a background in the military and he said he just wanted to share the story because he never forgotten about it and it was so when\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instances where people are record these huge dogs I mean right on um held in the ... you make that that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic ... and ... you know you can see All right maybe as an animal scape from the new or maybe somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the ... the u._k. countryside\nAnd some of the donors have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those start with the dog\n[noise] well yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mine which kind of looks like a a dog like animal parts you know clearly is not\nWell in England or the okay we have what I noticed find some black dogs now I'm Conan off of Conan Doyle who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel harm to the basket veils he actually face his novel on a pre existing legend\nI'm off one of these many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k. um that typically a much longer much larger than regular dogs on my face fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the elections and traditions if you were to say one of these um find some black dogs would either made that you would die or you know a close family member or friend would die\nI'm ... and light that dog my entire often seen at the same places like um crossroads graveyards um places like that in moderation is I've got several\nUm reports of people saying the find some black dogs in the vicinity of stone circles in the u._k. not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but you know there are many many um smaller\nUm formations around the a K and I've got two cases from Scotland where witnesses so one of these large black dogs that and like they okay she's going back centuries the dog was that one second and then quite literally gum and next second you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what these things are you know that clearly not normal dogs I mean all the ice the spirits of dogs\nThat once lived um I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine a fight with the spirits of of that dogs would resemble the dogs they look like in real life I'm ...\nAnd then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big cat lived there well now you\nWrite in fact they become known as a base I Am big cats and I get every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the K now\nThe occasional sort of ask I ask I pay you know from a zoo menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases and you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a sky from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the problem is\nAre these large black cats roaming around the a K which simply defy explanation because the sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of the top of Scotland these hundreds every\nNow for that many reports to exist you know there must be anti colonies of these creatures roaming around that is if they offer flesh and blood regular animals which not every race actually the phenomenon thinks that's the case you\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local news pay for the ... post and somebody saying this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or if soaring would be a better term to use over the woods I'm at a high speed um you know kind of a like a flying man I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the crash and one of them have and spoke to the local police or the I don't really know what the police could have done about it but it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have the spy too weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog man and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou have a story or in the book about the terror you call it the terrible old man thing Nineteen Seventy seven services in a window of all places in Sunnyvale, California\n[noise] oh yeah that that's a really creepy story I guess appropriate for um Halloween I miss a story a given to me by a lady named Terri and she had the ... in Nineteen Seventy seven with well I can only call like a man in black\nAnd not many black as they're portrayed by Will Smith and tell me late Jones in the movies\nBut the rail manning black much weight of as sort of very pile and skiing a and don't and look entirely human by sort of almost ... ... and found pie alike and there are a lot of paranormal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know\nWhereas in the movies ... sacred agents you know of a sacred agency but Terry telling me the story of has Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time she was having lunch with a friend\nAnd they create the mining black time towards them sat down and proceeded to tell Terry I'm basically to the future of the the rest of her life\nAnd it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy and she said that just looking at him was like looking it's somebody who was dead and almost like the money was ... I was that sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of penetrating eyes this old black suits and just gave off base rarely I'm sort of intimidating creepy ... didn't really come across as being completely human\nAnd didn't something I mean the thing is that this guy said was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her\nOr yes that's right or she had a lot of tragedy in a life and the kind of\nFull costume that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never re forgot it's all ... states and I think you know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for the rest of your life you know believing that's\nWhat this mindset or things said I'm going to come true you know I mean you could understand how it would create a great deal of stress for someone\nYou know the ... at least the movie version of ... men is that this creature years\nDifferent forms the different people at different times but as a harbinger of doomed to come and it predates the bad things that are about to happen um is that sort of how you think the ... the plays out in the men's I think the point pleasant and beyond\nWell yeah I mean there's no doubt it's um you know when you look at them off my story that it sort of saturated in witness and tragedy for people who don't know it kicked off the lights sixty six important players in West Virginia\nI when people started saying this creature that some people described as like a flying humanoid\nA few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act so others described as a giant bud\nAnd um but whatever that I was saying people would play that I Would say something way bigger than any normal but bad or anything like that\nAnd when the scientists that hides in sixty seven you had a lot of weird a UFO activity\nUm the surfacing of this weird creepy character named injury cold it was like approach how men in black and also a lot of other amyloid ban cancers and also reports of women and

wings into\nA humanoid form and a friend of mine John Diamond Suze looked into this case deeply John eventually have to walk away from the research because he found that every time he started to get back into the race a chicken investigating the all my stories\nAbout things would happen to him like car accidents and are ill health\nAnd it happens so many times close to just after he started doing the research that he realized\nFrom his perspective but it really was as if you know a cloud of a dark cloud would come over him every time he got into he said he quite literally ... eventually said

of people who've seen the same thing and I I don't have a strong feeling of it either way whether it is wishful thinking the part of people who follow this stuff and we should what happened or\nThere's some credibility to those sightings what's your take on it\nWell you know you do get strange creatures waves in the field of crypto zoology you know a lot they as you mentioned the the ... just said in Chicago last summer um\nAnd we get kind of spite so or waves of activity in relation to other creatures I mean for example in the Nineteen seventies in much of Pennsylvania\nUm there were certain spots and outbreaks of big activity\nUm some of these like bumps the stories you know the the welfare decide things for years and then suddenly there's you know a two week period we get a lot of things like that\nAnd um that kind of I'm I'm really feel like he's he's sort of power allowed through arrived various other types of of creatures so again I'm inclined to think that may be\nYou know something that suggests again a connection between these creatures even though they have that perceived as being very difference of course but uh but that that way of activity in um Chicago last year it was very interesting\nMan from my perspective although I didn't really investigate the ... because um there are a lot of people\nUm who are already looking into each one of them a friend of mine Alison John Lennon shaving two and a lot of good research into it but what I did I wrote a couple of articles about aids\nAnd in relation to have a number of witnesses to the mosque in Chicago had suddenly afterwards had lots of ... perfect he dreams of nightmares of nuclear destruction and I'm\nAtomic mushroom clouds and you know the end of civilization\nAnd I actually had somebody in the ... region of close to the tea people respond to that article um who many of them living in the Chicago area who felt that um you know something might happen\nOr others I had these\nI continue um dreams and nightmares of atomic war in the United states and um and I felt somehow that he was connected with our sightings\nOf this my last month talked preacher so in that sense you know that was that was kind of a disturbing situation you know to get old days nuclear\nNightmares as I call them you know from paper saying these strange creatures was was kind of you know be disturbing\nUm you
