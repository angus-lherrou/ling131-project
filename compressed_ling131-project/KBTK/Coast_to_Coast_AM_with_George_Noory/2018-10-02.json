Stone Mountain of our lives where am I Know him from got it okay all\nRight so it's now move over to the sports desk and they get right to the a story from Penn State because you want to handle the police helicopter use their was sure interesting isn't it literally connecting the dots\nIt's a weird story so Saturday night's big game was between Ohio State and Penn State and it was at home for Penn State they had a hundred and ten thousand people there that's how big their stadium is\nAnd apparently the tailgating ... area got out of hand so much though that police on the ground felt that they were no longer able to control the situation and a helicopter was brought in\nNow the problem is the video footage of this is frightening\nThe helicopter was so low to the grounds that tents that people had set up you know those little for poll tents that you like catering type tense they were airborne and flying around through the air they were crashing into people's cars they were there was debris\nFlying through the air hitting people people started to run their word uh there were a mounted police are on the ground apparently one of the horses and one of the police officers got injured it was a disaster so now the FAA is going to investigate because the helicopter was probably breaking laws it was so low to the ground\nAnd to have that much debris flying around some of the students one girl her face was cut by garbage that was flying around it was just an absolute irresponsible mess if you want to look this up you can see the footage went viral and people just running around it was an absolutely like\nTo have this happen at a college game by the police it it just it seems like it was such an overkill\nBut um we'll see where the investigation goes I don't know Penn State would get fined for this if the NC double age jumps into it but I'm a lot of parents are very upset with the university that this entire situation was so unsafe for everyone involved\n... yeah [noise] uh this stuff going on and get you can't control the tailgate and don't allow the tailgate you know what that's like that's kind of how and I know tailgating\nAnd ... college football's it it goes hand in hand but if you can't control it better and you have to bring in a helicopter that's going to cost so much disruption than than don't allow kids to tailgate anymore\nThat's it\nAll right
