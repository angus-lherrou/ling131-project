man from the train\nDiscovering America's most elusive serial killer how he\nDid it Ninety deaths um and yet as he says he's not not even sure that they know all of the people that this man Paul Miller\nOr could have killed starting in Eighteen Ninety eight until he was willing to lead stopped um but what we have is we have a name and we have a description\nCurious to see whether that my jogging anybody else's memories of a local story in their community like you did with me earlier in the show we'll find out next coast to coast am this is Ian but it [noise]\nMom who did he worked as a matter but they there are some of the I think he there\nAnd the actions that he used the word they lumbering type of axes\n... it was a mostly a like a an axe that was found in would pile ... almost all of the house ... murders were uh were houses burn wood times\nCoal a buddy either water coal use an ax to split the wood or break up the coal right he would he would use the coal actually the boy that would actually whatever you've found outside the building\nWas she know that answers actually to my previous question about dropping the act's I wasn't so much thinking in terms of stigma\nBring the evidence I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he and purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a type of actually had in the house that's when he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten and Nineteen than it was very common for people to have an ax\nOh yeah wouldn't mile outside their house oh yeah\nThat's why I connect to the story I grew up in a small town in the Nineteen fifties fifties and sixties and we have an accent what Bob that's not our house and I I chopped\nA lot of with with him you know to a burning out\nYou know my dad till ... similar story but then he and his brothers you know they would tempt to fight over who's going to be chopping wood and and when we were growing up we had an ax around the house [laughter] we we did a lotta would jumping for some reason I did was attached to it I Do let me bring in some Paxton whose in Chicago\nAnd the first time caller line for Bill James author of\nFrom the train very interesting Paxton\nLike a fascinating I'm an English teacher and naturally I I lean pretty heavily on coal at this time of year and I I wanted to ask your guest filthy she noticed any\n... any parallels between ... vision you wrote about and that says that the murderer always has a guilty conscience and really tries to get caught and some of the more famous stories like the black cat\nWell ironically the berries and acts and his wife had hot right that's what he describes it and and one of the least Tom ... he's not going to be caught so\nYou know he can't walk the cat up to the wall and ah you know he tried to get them into the basement and ... how how the wallet but he always cutting it given away\nThe ... by the way while doing research on it\nBut look how followed the wallet but he always collected given so what\nThe ... by the way while doing research on the crime book I happened to find a story in Paris newspaper in Eighteen forty six a which is apparently the original story from which the casket with ... among the autos his base\nThe a a poll also of course was it was a avid reader crime choices as I'm sure you know\nBe a anyway the answer is no ... he absolutely was not\nTo get caught in fact he many many many cereal murders are sort of playing games with the police and sometimes they want you to know who did it uh but they just don't want to because I don't want to be convicted of it but that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is that he had a very unusual\nOr aversion to being hot\nHe wasn't he wasn't the absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent\nAnd very well thought out your basic action\nNot ever to be caught one reason he never took anything from a crime scene even the you know if there was a hundred dollars sitting on the shelf there you wouldn't take it because he knew very well that if he was caught fleeing a crime scene and playing a scene with or something that could be\nTied to that scene you know a lot of people were executed for that the so no he was he was very quite unusual extent\nYou have a an aversion to being caught\nSome serious restraint and the guy who didn't have any money that they choose some discipline um they mentioned let's go to Marie who's in Athens, Georgia until she goes for Bill James ...\n... high ... in in um\nWell I was calling because I I was kinda curious the first of all you got out talking about the acts and um my my brother and I we were in fact the gay and murder happened it was after the civil war in our family um\nAnd he was my great however I mean that grandfather was he was killed when an act\nAnd then they think that his wife and\nMaybe a son did that but I ended up being a brother in law that was convicted of it and um he lives right out and I feel I can hope that some field workers would be blamed for bank anyway and so we were investigating that and then my brother was murdered a year ago\nAnd then his son is in jail for telling the guy about two years ago by now so if there's a lot of it around but um\nBut I was wondering you may you mentioned earlier about a person you know if they didn't make a lot of mistakes and the person that we believe that killed my brother he um he seemed to be\n[noise] he was so far he's gotten away with it and so how do you find out about a person if you um\nYou know where they're from but I'm just wondering if maybe he had done this before you know what I mean he was because every little detail he's saying she knew have now like if you go in\nAnd it seems to perfect for the first time this is what you're saying\nI I certainly feel for you I'm very story about go through the uh and and\nUh I Wish there was on the ticket helped would be helpful to you but I I there really isn't I mean I I think as I said in our case we were just very fortunate to uh to find this treasure trove of information about the about the first crime the uh but I I it's not something you can and we we can to\nRachel and I were to sit out\nAnd solve in other series of crimes like this\nWe wouldn't it wouldn't happen for us because it wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew what we were doing it just the way the crime set up the way the story set up that broke for us\nI'm Susan or even the religion to chew my uh ... in New York for a Bill James on those because they um\nYeah it's got the morning gentlemen and when the light to ah I see a ... year back in the satellites\nOf laughs and good luck with that when I'm looking forward to it\nBut I have um a a two part question which some comment and outlets and I'm over the or what not to add New York it's it's over the\nInternet [laughter]\nProbably start age now we have that she would already cages at at hand ah people at the FBI look and say that profile lace so I didn't know\nIf you put it in a more modern contacts how a such a a FBI profile of Mike Mike ... sky out\nMuch for that I'm also I like to hear more about and whether we can bark and time into somebody in a sense that got caught up including the black people who um [noise]\nWell got by not even got one child like getting Lynch and the last part is I I I you mentioned about\nThe state at least at this time at the time that the sanctuary [noise] I ... I'm I Am I recently read a book by um you\nKnow ... it's called how I became white on Jacksonian Arab pre civil war and he actually tried to police they shot the fact that you know they had like two hours look and say she would get to\nBlack folks but pay off their supply Dan ... basically competing gang basically street gangs with volunteer fire department\nThat had competing spite ten and then she end and I like in common that whether you know you're with gangs that came up as as sad that's long been differently than I'll listen off air over the Internet thank you sound like a I don't\nWant to thank you for your most intelligent questions you know I'm somewhat familiar with the firehouse gangs\nAre from New York and pretty civil war because they are I wrote about them in the book popular crime or they were in a it was a woman that this gets back to pose there were there was a woman named Mary Rogers or who was murdered in a New York yeah and I wanted to say in\nEighteen forty five or thereabouts a poll poll fictionalized as as the murder of Murray rosy but the actual woman's name was very Rogers the a and the uh\nThere was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for her cry for that crime but they they they it really is an odd thing that there were these fire houses that were really just just a\nA ... was assembly Joe's of pretty unruly people are and they they were kind of terrorizing the city I so yeah I I Do the that's an odd story isn't it\nYou'll see the proof right inside my real brokerage account this isn't about overnight riches but once you discovered this for yourself you can start on the same path overnight you're seven minutes away from changing everything you thought you knew about trading and investing good paycheck proof dot com that's paycheck proof dot com\nNinety seven point one of the coast to coast more stimulating taught [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWe've got callers coast to coast we need to talk with Bill James give us a minute here's we wrap up the last question\nUm we talked about how there were in fact gangs of fire departments and\nAnd I I think if anybody wants to know more about that too it's handy to go to you can watch the movie streets in New York right to Scorsese movie ... ... there's a lot of them but it's a little strange to near this kind of cool but she lifted the ... the question about what it if you had a modern police or FBI profile or take a look at this case\nI haven't asked them do that because the that would not be in my nature I mean\nYou know what this is my book is written to say this is what I think and if you think something that's up to you I I but I wouldn't ask the up a John Douglass monitored a well known profile or has spoken and written about Alaska\nOr one of his observations was that ah the um well he had several observations about all of the crime that lined up with what we believe for other reasons one was that the murder had to be older\nBecause he is extremely organized I mean is it off the chart of how organized is this burger this guy is\nUnbelievably organized or the or and and also he he um he said that Robert ... Kelly who was accused of murder is it for us to really couldn't have done it because his mind is very disorganized but\nAlso because it was not physically strong enough um we know that the Paul Miller was physically extremely strong and extremely agile the um uh so yeah there's\nSomething there's something there but not a lot I mean I haven't I haven't asked profile afraid of the pain you know frankly wouldn't care what they have to say because you know they got their opinion I got mine the book\nIs about innocence accused of the crimes that I'll tell you briefly just one of those stories and murder in Maine and night you know to a man named Henry Lambert who was white obviously and that's that was accused of the crime ...\nIt was just a a he was a a a mock around me was I got a an an educated illiterate French Canadian who uh who a borderline homeless drank quite a bit it was accused of the crime and it was in prison for Twenty years\nOr before a it became a cause for lab in\nMaine and a very good lawyer eventually what we're trying to free him and that free the governor of Maine of actually a graphic out of this fall apart and to him all that aren't based on a ... on actual innocence a buddy that happened after he spent Twenty years in jail there are a lot of stories\nLike that in this in the book it's quite it's a terrible side effects of what happened because our\nPolice are are not relevant to this story because they were by Nineteen ten in the New York city police were relatively organized and relatively sophisticated now relative to now but by relative to the places where these crimes occurred these crimes occurred in places it didn't have a place to park\nThey are they are they had like a city Marshall and that was it the or not and not really uh\nThe uh not really that connected to my book\nNo fair enough um but it just to illustrate ... in that movie of of how those gangs tied to operate within the government is the where everybody was vying for jobs even if that meant getting in fights to keep them um and and um and by the way I think ...\nOr would endorse what you've done I think you might think you'd be a very proud of the way in which the ... I Hope\nSo it's not as if they're not really being that I don't think I think they would endorse it and I think they would find some interesting insights in there but this is the first time caller David is in Chicago on coast to coast am for Bill James Dave\nHow am I go ahead\nI'm I'm Glad to hear you back I called the call\nThank you yeah thank you\nUm I have a couple of comments for Mr Jang ...

thanks\nAnd he's playing baseball more enjoyable to me\nThroughout my whole life and they have your hamster or you know you know than bill but anyway the the reason I call them it's just a thing as time of year fight\nYou pointed out in Nineteen Ninety or eighty nine game was the first smarter than Boston around you are and and then I was curious I started thinking about what was the bargain murderers exporters\nAnd if there's any connection to them to\nSee it it's a fair question the question we get a lot is or it could easily connected to the New Orleans ... murders and and the answer that one is easy no they're absolutely not connected to the New Orleans tax murder the uh but that Lizzie Borden cases not as easy to uh\nTo reject because of a time and place however it's quite a bit different than our murderers Alberta committed with a heavy act the ... in the middle of the night\nThe Lizzie Borden murders committed with really a a hand they hatch a hand held a hatch it in the middle of the day and and they do not have really any of the\nBut don't have very many of the signature elements of our crime so I don't think they're connected all but I Can't uh I couldn't say that it you know and all connection between the two crimes is that uh that you probably know that in that Lizzie Borden case there was a man staying with the uh\nUh the board and family are on the night before they were murdered and he was a farmer who had a farm maybe ten miles from Alaska so that's an odd connection\n[noise] uh and I think the Lizzie Borden pieces interesting I think it was the first thing that came to mind for a lot of people and maybe speaks to the idea of going into a ... does connect in the sense that it was a family\nIt was a house it was ... and then it was a it may be a crime of opportunity um in in grabbing an axe that was near the hat you know that was that the property that to inside\nI'm In the idea that it was in and out really quickly and then nothing was stolen\nWhich is another piece because you know that was you know why why would somebody doing to the house and killed were it not for that that was the part of the motives piece that was presented you know again was bored and was that she stood do inherent property which makes sense but it did you like give me a moment to where\nI was thinking about let's go to a dentist is in New York on coast

time but this was that time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what do you do if if\nIf Ross was kind of Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of\nAliens and invading armies and all of that if if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] um let people go out here grade our own local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the core known\nA ... a quiet North Korea there like a hybrid electric that we're currently on your space shuttle Atlantis over ... pointing either to get every single year on it if they are great opportunities are people that go out and really try to experience\nThat hunter yelling as getting our or feel like you're a crash can point seven other people go out here by to my heart\nA week at one ... bottom where and how mile from Roswell beautiful a great place where you are and things like that but\nAgain I'm more more of the stars and the character and people get dressed up and they feel that they become wine or they may come down and I know\nThat that barrier there is something where that ran out and they're trying to connect with an ashtray around Halloween and ...\nUh you know it's just that that area there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with an especially around Halloween and during the UFO festival in July\nSo I I I'll be traveling through Roswell I'm I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to uh my new position will be teaching it to Kansas State and my my older my younger son and I was always wanted to cope good Roswell right so we\nWe we mapped out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way to dip down to the Roswell before we come back up again\nAnd it seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there if anybody were interested in in being able to\nGo to the crash site\nOr ... or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the crushing Roswell where what can they do\nSo they can go to the Iraq War on international year for me in the research center which is a great opportunity to really dive into their car and the research a part of the crash I'm definitely what check out the library for those who are really the sneakers and do you believe\nIn addition to that we have a new record toward that is done by a medical researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first for over twenty ... years and we will take you to the exact locations\nOf the timing of the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival\nFor the first time last year that broke or families where the crash occurred allegedly they will take you out to the crash site where a knack for example of rent a house is still kind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land\nAnd so those are just a couple of things that I Would definitely recommend that\nPeople checked out and then you know search for the troops and so\nOkay so plenty to use the word allegedly in there which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened to you know something we don't know\nI I was going there are some people still are kind of on the phone and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nOr we know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the year for me is in uh the locals know who the tourists are because\nIt is that her and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that wind which is a great story I bring your camera take pictures stock in the rock a visitor center we have to amazing alien decorate our economy especially now for Halloween\n[laughter] puts on a big festival with our police officers and things like that for the community that um these they're about six foot\nAlien or not people like to cook pictures with and and you'll hear the story of you know are employers and my name is ... and ... and\nUh you know people really come here searching for the truth and revoke or we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you're very very\nWell that'd be great thank you appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Roswell for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nAnd so our population has doubled in size where we're account about forty thousand and especially on the big anniversary of the best of all I'm you know we've hit close to doubling our size on average per year for tourism we hear a little over two hundred and thirty thousand visitors\nThat on the rest of your Research Center hardy good\nPretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts a until I'm bringing our next guest next but thank you honey you know and if I'm if I'm driving to time we get a chance they'll say hello okay yes please thank you\nHoney the Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism the public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a J W let me just tell you very funny book you resist great sense of humor is really enjoy all the sort of a comic inside on a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this second this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary plays in the timeline\nOf American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people to come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\n[laughter] yeah All right uh there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people come um and of course of the month it's a quarter million so the massive amount of people for the small city to have to the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of bugs it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked Halloween in same subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in in the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about a on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\n... that there are other places around the world outside of Salem\nThat had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people selling wasn't the first ever which trial wasn't the last one the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for them you know there are you know the first for trout America you're a victim was in Connecticut and in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nIt is the honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed countries are still being being asked you for being which is the the the strange thing about that to me of course is that all of the planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's Salem, Massachusetts\nThe government protects the costs of Medicare plants will decrease this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best right help markets offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide help folks maximize their benefits and say\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind\nEnrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go at it won't get unbiased help to find a plan that may cost last and cover more with our co payments more choices like dental\nAnd vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act now our health markets Medicare assistance is free\nThanks Mike this is Michael method for health markets\nFor your free Medicare assistance coal eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two that's eight hundred six nine for forty five forty to eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two Ninety seven point one of the\nDoctor on air and online a big talker radio dot com [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo er Jay W ... author of a season with the which I just had to look up some of those steps that we had mentioned more vaguely two thousand eleven bar do Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt lincolnshire England\nOr long ago turned its ... incident in which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw in Sweden there's which memorial to the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some of them and not even all that happened\nIn America but at Salem\nThat sticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it it's really a mystery to the even that for the big question that go with the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing\n[laughter] yeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it is about a dozen other reasons why I kinda Salem grabbed onto that moniker and kind of held onto it did over the course about two centuries\nBut it's kind of a you know you it's a moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that not usually what a town holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about Chicago's celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy real killer the famous worlds exposition right you don't know did he do go on their way to put up signs of go it happened here folks\n[laughter] right through it I think to to fight for that one is that you know the tragedy in Salem itself\nWas basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was authentic part of the trial right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course generation around filmed actual the actual stereo started next door in what's now Denver was at the time to film village so sale itself doesn't really have a kind of\nKind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victim of a trial I mean the actual which is I live there today it means the cartoon which represents Halloween since ... than it was kind of become Halloween count as well so it's a\nParent which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today in twenty Eighteen\nYeah I guess ... and this is important and I this is great distinction can't\nHelp but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims of murder them they were executed and they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy that's kind of underneath the underneath their four or so to speak\nAnd part of it that's ... connected to the tragedy with more just around you know the identity and all these other kind of thing just become and into an Eighteen\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] he is so they\nThey don't celebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they thought it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and then October thirty first um but really but over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year do you want to sound Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowd with a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from\nThe city if they'll itself it's Mardi Gras basically it is it really is\nThat would crowd there's a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of Salem itself\nIt's Mardi Gras beads\nIt is it really is um I could talk again hundred thousand people packed to the small downtime with the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know five or six blocks\nAnd you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes the freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again my girls are good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans\nMardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras um\nBut ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same ... did you get in Mardi Gras in any way but there's probably some amount of alcohol in consumed during this celebration\nHeld definitely actually right now we're in the middle of a nor'easter so that you know that's how many of them right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween right but it was a part of it but this is within the party\nOkay so you you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean you see them known for being hunted either Salem witch Denver's former Salem Village or seen them are there were a lot of haunted houses were were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original ceiling trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims you have monsters because of the film was trials didn't just evolved which is in the story involves\nDemons and m's than shaped sisters and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass so you have all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history we're up three hundred and Thirty years of history\nSo that is just you know a lot of dead people\nOver the centuries so yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening and say on the um the ghost tours their spooky places there's the other side of the executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky pathology around the city\nNow you've been here most of these I should say you've been there right you go there so oh yeah all the time all their two weekends ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but it's it's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders and all kinds of things and I've never had an experience so\nMy interest in that as more of the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest is more than the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me\nYeah let's let's the best what's the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you captured well you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the ones that really creepy ones is one of the Boston trainer victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual historical event that then I can\nReverberate and have come it's all around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape from the jails there so all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know macabre kind of\nEvents happened in Salem that nothing to do with the with trials\nAll that kinda stuff kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of uh of mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there's somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm curious do was there an attempt to for him to do like ... or something while he was there\nNo no he was ... or the building actually still stands it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there the original police that station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do what he was in town a performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know escape\nAs a PR move for his next big event so that he wasn't down there doing all of a say on busing but who is doing is a is a scape escape

Jeff he's talking to Jeff and I don't even know who ... who you're talking about Jeff Sessions suggest estimate buddies that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all great points\nThey should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning\nAnything in the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they tried to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been this slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nIs that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point advantage of the American people realize their mistake electing Trump but the Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argue against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason the two thousands actually live germs the American people\nWere all of a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't\nBelieve it but we got media narratives that a gigantic blue wave was going to happen and we had that media narrative\nGo on from December last year all the way through\nSeptember\nThis year and then and then\nThe generic ballot started tightening and then it began to look\nMaybe it won't be as big a blue wave\nAnd Republicans look like they might actually gain seats in the Senate\nAnd oh no now the president's approval number is higher than it ever been CNN's on poll forty four percent\nRasmussen has trumpet fifty one there is nothing happening\nThat suggests St blue wave is happening I frankly don't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth\nI eat election day people have to start revealing in these mad cap for veterans and projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they can for the sake of their business\nThere in the polling business they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all of the case who would hire them\nSo now we're told well there's been a shift a little bit and it may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways the Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republicans in hold the house foreign ways they could lose the house well a month ago there was no way the Republicans are going to hold out\nNow all of a sudden we're starting to see it as a blue wave may not I don't think you'd ever did I don't think he ever did exist I think it made up manufactured\nYou've got to pull result you want depending on when you take the pole and who you decide to put in your sample\n\nThere is no way\nThere is simply no way that a political party openly promoting this invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive landslide when\nThe American people are not angry that we have not\n\nStopped this the American people in mass are not wanting more\nIllegal immigration the American people in a majority no matter how you slice it are not asking for a political party\nTo stop paying attention to the border and let everybody who wants to him in the American people are not there the American people never been there the Democratic party is there and the Democratic party wants you to think a lot of Americans are there but they aren't\n\nGoing through your own poll wherever you hang around do you think we ought to basically eliminate the border let anybody wants to come in and I can guarantee you less than ten percent of the people are going to say yes and yet\nThey can look at a drive by news media every day and you would get the impression is a lot of Americans that a lot of people to support this idea of these are so poor people there Thursday hungry we we we have so much they have so little we must but that's not\nA position it's going to win elections if it were we would have had amnesty back in two thousand two\n\nIf that was the position of a majority American people Donald Trump won an never gotten the Republican nomination\nIf the people of this country wanted mobs of seven thousand or eight thousand to be admitted into the country no questions asked to be granted asylum Trump want to never gotten the nomination he certainly would not have been elected president so you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think\nWe'd go up you know what Trump was wrong we don't need a wall this proves\nWe just need to let these people in that's the way to stop the chaos they want and let them in we should feed them we should house than they have nothing there toward are coming from ... countries let them that's not\nA majority opinion of the United states the beat it is going to try to make people who think that way I look like they're mean spirited cold hearted heartless and all this but it's not the case\n\nThat's not an accurate description of the American people\n\nI I none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever\nAccurate description of the American people\nSo I none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever that Trump is in trouble because he wants to build a wall that he's in trouble and the Republicans are because they want to secure the border\nAnd yet the media reliably very subtly at this point sympathizing with the people on the quote unquote caravan\nTrying to find a way to make Trump look like the bad\nGuy here and that's just not where the American people out one other thing about this\nNot long after the find a looming over by a second look at it this is a CNBC story from just this morning the headline growing caravan of migrants heading to the U.S pushes deeper into Mexico let me give you a\nQuote from this story Mexican president elect\nOn his mind what is the best open our daughter sing Jeff said yesterday that the United states Canada and Mexico work out of joint plan for funding development in the poorest areas of Central America and southern Mexico\nYeah isn't that the timing of this interesting we got I have a commission we need to put together off try wider will come mission\nTo fun to quote unquote the double ... poor areas of Central American southern Mexico so that these people don't want to come north\n\nTranslation Mexico and all of Central America out house countries so Canada and the U.S need to give up billions of dollars\nSo are
