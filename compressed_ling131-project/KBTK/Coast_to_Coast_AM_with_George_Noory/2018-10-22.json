that were things just kind of fell through the cracks where no one was looking for them um combined to make this is such a tragedy and then to top it all off captain McVeigh the captain of the ship who lived\nUsed floating along on this on a raft doesn't know if he's going to survive or not but he knows that his career is over and then you might even be court martialed and sure enough he was a

sunk\nBut the standing orders of the military put that in his purview that was at his discretion and he chose to exercise that discretion um and then when commander ... testified at the trial he said that he would have sent McVeigh\nWhether he had been ... or not and then it didn't make a difference but he was testifying and Japanese through translator and the translator did not translate exactly what he said\nUh correctly and commander ... could understand enough English to know that but not enough to\nReally repair the damage and also he was you know in this very intimidating environment and so I don't think it was really can conducive for him to sit there and argue either but I'm In later interviews Sarah found out from his granddaughter that that was something he always regretted\nWas that um he had been translated incorrectly and that had and that ... in part had been kept in the day\nAnd he was angry years later zero right at the with the retiring of the USS Indianapolis Sabrina namesake ship many years later a there was an attempt to get him to open up and share the story and he wanted nothing to do with it\nExactly you know they're a commander built or I'm Sorry captain and built Tony who was the commanding officer of the Indianapolis namesake submarine when she was a he commissioned\nBill went over and tried to talk to ... and he said they didn't believe me then they won't believe me now and he wanted nothing to do was talking with him you know but he did what I was actually pretty incredible as he actually wrote a letter you know kind of flashing forward a few years to the exoneration effort ... wrote a letter\nExplaining his side of the story and saying that the captain should never have been found guilty and you know kind of did what he could do in order to help exonerate this man\nI tell the story in the book about a Nineteen sixty reunion a group of survivors\nAnd tapping McVeigh goes up and he's not exactly sure how he's going to be received by by the crew because you know he was court martialed um he received as you noted the book these terrible letters from the family you didn't really been punished enough and\nMarshall um he received as you noted the book these terrible letters from the family you didn't feel he's been punished enough\nAnd you know\nReally guilt tripping them for years afterward so he shows up at the Ninety six you bend and how was he received a when\nHe was received with open arms he he very much dreaded going to this reunion in Nineteen sixty he hadn't seen these men [noise] except for just a couple of them but most of these men he had not seen\nSince Nineteen forty five right after the court marshal so they decided to have a reunion and they have their reunion in the ships namesake city Indianapolis, Indiana and captain McVeigh was dreading it that when he got there they actually um\nTravelled out a dozens and dozens of survivors and their wives met him at the airport and they formed\nTo receiving lines are across the tarmac because they didn't have debt ways the way we do now they would they would just they would deep plane right onto the ramp and so they formed two lines\nWhen captain they they got to the bottom of the aircraft loading stairs someone shouted attention on deck and everybody's snap to attention and then they began to chair and clapped and and ... came to his eyes and he he couldn't believe that they were receiving him so warmly\nAnd that continued through the entire reunion weekend\nSerious talk a little bit of difficulty in getting materials you talked about going through archives and records are here with me did you run into road blocks that you could not get past than if so what were they\nActually one of the the documents that really helped us pay the biggest picture was the quarter of inquiry documents and\nYou know I had tried for years Lynn had you know come into the picture and joined me in this effort to get a copy of this document and the reason it was so important was that it was really the first recorded testimony of any of the survivors right after the sinking\nSo you know just days after their rescued there in the hospital in Guam and their testimonies are taken and so we tried everything to get these documents and this actually this specific report\nAnd we would come back you know oh it's last forever oh one you know we got one copy of it and it was entirely redacted and you know freedom of freedom of Information Act\nShould've allowed us to have this and then you know we contacted the the source again and our contact said well we don't have an an redacted version doesn't exist and so\nInterestingly enough you know a a friend or actually at a young man who became a friend was the grandson of the rescue pilot who landed in the water and same fifty three men his\n... his grandson was actually\nAn inspector general sorry I'm trying to remember the title he's inspector general works with the navy and he was actually the person who got us this document and this kind of showed us really testimonies of what happened not only when the ship was torpedoed\nAnd those final moments but what was happening in the water because\nIn the court marshal they did not allow any of the testimony is about what took place in the actual water because they didn't you know that would impact how\nMcVeigh was viewed in so it was kept strictly to what took place when the ship was torpedoed\nAnd the events leading up to that so this new quarter of inquiry document was so important because you know Seventy years later stories can change or stories can be impacted by other stories but this was the purest form of what really took place not only when the ship sank but in the water for those five nights and four days\nWhen you talk about the the wife immediately after they were rescued what it was like for the survivors where they were taken I I Would assume more of them died after because of their injuries and exposure\nWell if you did die and and if you can imagine\nAwful that was not only for the men themselves but for their families to know that they had actually made it all the way to rescue\nOnly to die of their exposure in their injuries um so I think three hundred and twenty were actually rescued is that correct Sara yes three hundred and twenty were rescued but only three hundred and sixteen ultimately survive so they were taken to\nBase hospitals around the Philippine see eventually converging on Guam\nWhere they had um some time to recover before they had to give their testimony\nAnd then they went aboard the USS homeland ... which was an escort terrier and they actually landed in our home city of San Diego where they were\nActually participated in a parade and then a very quickly they went home a\nCop buses and trains back to their hometowns some of them ... got out in the navy some of them had survivors leave and then got out of them stayed and made careers of the navy [noise] um\nAnd you know this was the greatest generation so that that majority of them and they just kind of put this behind them they went on to have careers as engineers and fishermen and everything you can think of police officers\nThat there were those he could not hold a job and there were those who became alcoholic and um had many many struggles\nAnd almost to a man none of them talked about it and not even to their families and they held it in for years and years and years um some for sixty years um but\nMostly they didn't talk about it today that would be a lot different I think people would be out trying to get a book deal or a movie deal or something like that but these men were different\nI think about that though Robert show a character in jaws you know you got that story bottled up he becomes a short cut her as a result of being one of those guys and I'm\nA very moving scene that was great I was going to use that clip anyway I was really glad to see the coverage in the in the book or or did you always have in mind keeping that in there\nWell yeah it's really you know when let them have gone across the country talking to groups about the story in this book you know one of the things that really comes out every time is\nThat most people learned about this story from jobs so it's an essential part of the stories history\nIs that you know the public learned about it this way and interestingly enough some of the children of the survivors actually first heard about it and that their father was involved in it by watching jobs you know they came home several accounts came home saw the movie\nWere really impacted by it and especially the scene and only to find out their dad was on the ship the scene is about well so you know it's pretty incredible the men didn't talk about it that long but then to find out this way but that's you know how your dad served in World War two so\nThat's N O W two three five five one set in\nNinety seven point one the big talk more stimulating talk\n\nSarah share with me your thoughts when you heard the news I think it was last year that the Indianapolis had been found a who is this a mission funded by Paul Allen\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill Tony who was a gentleman I mentioned earlier this some commander of Indianapolis\nAnd you know those contacted by the navy and he called me and since there they found the ship and I didn't know what he was talking about at four in the morning of and so you know\nDating my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before\nThe petrol group which has the vessel that were ... responsible for finding the ship and there's been several attempts and they were the first one to be successful\nAnd what was interesting about it is they said you have three hours before we released this information to the press so go ahead and call the survivors so villain I spent the next\nThree hours of calling the survivors up and being able to share with them the news that they're shifting found so that was a pretty incredible experience to hear their take on all of it\nWhat's their reaction in general\nIt was really I mean it was very somber was most of them I couldn't believe it actually happened in that it happened in their lifetime or\nWhat [laughter] mostly reverence and then there was a young man by the name of a famine Lopez he was a sailor and Indianapolis in the day the ship sank hit a really good day playing dice with his buddies and so he wanted to know if they would go down and find his money stock\nThat winning [laughter] you know\nAcross the board it was general you know respect and reverence for this story but yeah there was a ... a couple of funny quotes here and there from the guys that you know they're always sailors that hurt\nAnd inland you know we've heard a little bit about road blocks put up a to the information they uh you know where they were not entirely helpful at every step of the way to get this story told what about reaction to the book since it's come out from the navy\nOh boy we've been very very gratified by the reaction there is um an admiral named Hancock who is the director of naval history and heritage can end\nAnd we make contact with admiral Koch at the survivors reunion and I believe it was funny it ten or twenty sixteen and we said well through we'd really like had your support and your health on this\nAnd um it was helpful and directing as various resources\nBut if you can imagine sending the real work at the heart that you've done to try to honor these men and honor the legacy and how the whole story of this shit and and get the entire history\nAnd drawing new analysis that very thing that happened in the story you can imagine taking that and then sending it to the director of naval history and heritage and saying hey sir hey admiral what do you think oh boy we were we nervous about that but\nHe really really has endorsed the story and I went to his full or since he saw which is what we came up with\nWell I Know Sarah has an award winning documentary film about it sure seems like it would make a great movie I'm a full big screen movie any thoughts about that\nWe are actually working on that right now so right stay tuned\nOkay we'll take a couple of calls I've got some other questions but ah west of the Rockies Jerry in Modesto, California has a personal connection to this story jury\nYeah are you doing my father was a on the ship was the first one or the ... to rescue the servers and the water and I still have the ... you can shoot short you know\nAnd I never saw my father ... years past ... years ago but I never saw him cry and do you try and talk about that story\nThat's amazing what he uh with the on the U.S has a piece of tape do eh or that that that you know the name of the shift that I\nDon't know I don't remember it's on a charge them stone and I was thinking about that before I call not yeah what was the name of the ship but he said he was the first one who knew him\nAnd he was talking it was horrific you know he tried to tell the story a little bit and my father never talked about in the about\nEgypt all that you know all those years you know\nHe was like a you know get it on your part of the ethos of that generation that those\nYeah yeah he was in World War two and Korea or use a gun or drink donors made for each class\nAnd that generation that those\nOh yeah yeah he was in World War two and Korea or use a gun or drink donors made for class you know but he ... he was a police officer who's officer for Thirty years but then there's an incredible story tonight\nActually heroic to go into harm's way like that and um if he went to board the Basset\nOne interesting story is that the commanding officer of the ... that was considered to be a coward by some of his men and indeed when they arrived on the scene he didn't really know what he was getting into\nAnd he needed it at that had been found could probably buy a submarine that they didn't know what exactly had happened and there was um a sailor spotted a large shark and the water and he said look at that fish\nWell fish is another word for it torpedo and had the cat in ...\nHe tried to get everybody out of there said he said I'm all ahead full we're going to get outta here we're going to leave the scene and his officers actually need need and lock the captain in his state room and continued with Iraq you have to be interesting if your dad this had been on that ship\nThanks Jerry appreciate it wildcard line run and used in the morning on good\nMorning or my father was also in the navy and he was on a destroyer escort Cecil jade de while he was twenty six years old he was the Ensign doctor\nAnd what's interesting over forty years I had opened up one of his uh I guess she just you know of all of his memory loss\nAnd I found unbelievable and eye witness accounts a letter of the eye witness accounts from the doctor's point of view of the rescue of the survivors\nI've got the letter in front of me it's dated August fifth Sunday at sea and it's a phenomenal letter I think the uh women would love to see this to read this is talk about the sharks\nIt talks about the fact that the polls these guys up kicking the sharks off their rear end\nShowing 'em up with the with a line given a morphine given him penicillin\nThis is an unbelievable letter from the of view of the doctor and it was my dad and he has been that some of the reunions but never did talk about this\nBut the fact that I found this letter it's about five six pages of the whole account its its history its historical I Would love to share this with a young ladies if I can get them getting information and\nI'll tell you what Ron why don't you hold on and Donna oh are are now there will get the information for you will pass it on to win and Sarah and thank you for calling appreciate you sharing that I Would like to see that myself thank you so how many how many of the survivors are still with us Sarah\nThere's fourteen still living\nBut I don't assume that they still have a gathering do they\nActually you know um we've gone to several events all over the country with them and they they do have reunions every July and Indianapolis I'm\nAbout five or six I think six came this year and it is dwindling but you know we'll have an event on the USS Hornet on Veterans Day and two of the survivors will be there for that so you know the the youngest is Ninety One but\nThey're still sailors that heart and I think think an arm wrestle man when [laughter]\nYou know it's a generational thing well we're we're hearing these descriptions both from the two of you in from the callers about um\nHow how these men reacted to it keeping bottled up inside you're right it would be different now people would be out there on Dr phil or or getting a book deal or something but keeping it inside I don't know if it's entirely healthy but it certainly has changed when you agree\nYes absolutely and I I Do wonder whether maybe pleasant how ... how the er I I don't know I think yeah I think that generation may have been a lot more stable than we are now that uh it is an interesting contrast isn't it and I think it has to deal with the\nThe um ... the media that we have today and I think they need to share everything instantly all the time and that wasn't the case back then\nOn the island\nLearn in mind onto me or my\nMom

Bigfoot where he went outside of Hooper and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd a kind of how it started\nAh you said you don't have a dog in the white meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo uh when I started the most local the most audacious the most vulgar\n[laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and\nThey will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause but since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kind of went down that path thinking well it must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around who put Andrew the sketches Harvey myself and Harvey's wife Gina ... also an agent for in Oklahoma\nWe were sat in stunned disbelief\nBecause the sketches were very human like yeah they were huge yeah they had hair all over the body there was this human quality that you just couldn't miss and they didn't look like apes they didn't have that\nApe characteristics that you would think of in a face in her chest et cetera and it was just shocking and\nWhen the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady in to a man they were consistently say Harvey you nailed it that is the ... you look like\nAnd when you talk about the older they would consistently say this is another tribe of people just aren't animals these are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with him at least and coexistence right\nYeah it in the tribal area and met the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe a and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there\nAnd this is your area this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see him\nThe only thing about the ... areas the trinity river I great salmon and steal head area\nA has just so much wildlife and if you drive through Hooper from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry Bush is\nOn the roadways and the surrounding mountains than I've ever seen anywhere in the world and there's\nThis association with berries and dig for over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I I Know that they're seen eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nYou uh I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as Lola man former law man at the state of the evidence about whether you'd say there is that there is there's sufficient evidence that something is real here and we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path I knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life\nAnd there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said yeah we were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I got to think that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a ah\nA PHD name Melba catch them\nDr catch him was one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs tissue blood et cetera that we'd bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America to test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted or many of them were there were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA\nAnd then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood saliva and all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this DNA\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA and what they showed was that the ... went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the female side\nTo the Arab region to ah Jerusalem to\nA Jordan ended that part of the world and this is when I was sent to Gen bank and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in this and\nUnbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever leading the male side of the equation and they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her write a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab a completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could have been compromised\nYet as the paper was written before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't do this but you and I work together to introduce Melba too of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\nShe listen to some of this but she didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper\nBut if you are strapped all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science\nWhich people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nMarry a a very precise DNA kind of testing the paper that was written by Dr Melba catch them maybe had some personal um observations that didn't belong in the paper but the\nThe DNA evidence David Was rock solid right\nWell that's the part that I don't think a lot of people understand it a this wasn't some\nHalf ale treatment it was it was the best of the best that DNA was sent to force certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake all of the labs got the same results or was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA has come back as bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that belt but did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her\nNow people are saying going to say well how do you know that's big for their well ... looks different than any other mammal hair in the world\nAnd I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her into a physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America\nAnd when you look at a big but here it's entirely different\nSo if it if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle and never went on to DNA but\nIf you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using her hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with is the real deal\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula Melba did to extract this DNA and to get the results\nAnd there's a lot of there's a lotta attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes\nThat's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's kinda like the UFO world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very bitter conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes their take their passion to different levels um to the point of\nFraudulent um material um and ah will stab people in the back and will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence ... at a minimum\nUm people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's human but it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part but the second says it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual\nBut it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with a human match on gender thing and when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours\nAnd how could that be\nUm we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA\nAnd luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some\nPipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kind of surmise that\nSay a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart\nBecause it appeared that a big foot was trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something and when it broke the PVC pipe and bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this that people haven't read the study they've read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it and they refused to get into the minutia of the data and read the report\nBecause it's available online and see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit to Melba she's a genius scientists that figure this out um it's unfortunate\n\nYeah because it got down to a thrown under the under the bus as she did as well um ... you said that the this this was not engine bank is it now or are they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it ...\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I made a lot of times you know these descriptions and there were some amazing working here there's some really a\nTremendous writing in some of these old articles a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading it off and making fun of the witnesses as well but these things\nUh from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading and often making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the three different categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eight oh did you how did you find all these\nSo ... ... again it was just me searching for old cases I'm missing people that seemed to miss that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded is two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as a description\nTwenty four used ape gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else\nNow the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U.S sixteen and Canada three and hungry ... three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. there were others but those were the bulk of them and then the states with the most articles about it\nA whirl Ohio with Twenty one\nThirteen California eleven Indiana eleven New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six [noise] and then the numbers keep going down from there but again it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a\nNew article in the missing but I started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nAnd one of the funniest things he did in his presentations his genius\nIs a lot of people say oh you know if you're overlay this map with the maps of the foot wild man disappearances there all the same and he puts up a map of like Bigfoot the ah appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes down like six maps and then he puts up a map and he doesn't say anything because you know what this Napa because this is a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they're kind of associated in the same location since the ...\n[laughter] and but it was his statement about giants that were found in past\nCenturies in mountains and in a excavations that really kind of got me thinking or these giants\nThe big foot that were buried or were these something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there were some of those stories here in Nevada you know the ... since you're showing the legends and stories about a big foot bones or a giant bones that were stashed in the game up in northern Nevada and uh yes what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find them\nWell why did these articles pointed to a some universities would get them but the the more likely candidates were all these when and it set in the articles was the Smithsonian\nYet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't how\nYou look back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your book is from the Marilyn that June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three describing an account or a witness to use this on the ... of a rubber an animal between twelve and Fifteen feet high\nIt's a sheep resembling a human the head with it which is an equal proportions the body the seats are two feet long and Harry uh that sounds like our guy doesn't mean the description semi modern descriptions of big ones\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds and I was stunned because nobody talks about it but when you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between twelve and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being\nOf their agency the FBI on their positions to wreak havoc on political

think you know I think her fan base feel the same way and I think that people who think opposite are not really big fans on her\nAnd I don't know I think she's are leaving you know and I just I I honestly I think when it comes out popular and he sees bigger than the NFL so I don't think it's going to hurt her at all wow maybe that's just me because I I like her um\nBut I don't know I I think I Would much prefer to see her perform then around five I think we're in five are fine but they're kind of boring but I guess they work for the NFL\nBut yeah it works for them they were well it's a free gig they don't get paid it's just the exposure\nOr she um hasn't talked much about this on social media but apparently made it clear to them that she didn't like the way that the NFL was a standing when it came to the leaving got ready to get it and they when they're good at that\nYou write apparently they asked paint as well and and then negotiations fell through with her so I guess the NFL

their country yeah like safe passage\nGoing through as long as you know going we don't mind you coming through I go to the United states I so why don't we withhold all of our aid for Mexico\nI yeah I don't understand what's in this from Mexico I don't understand why they don't protect their borders better and why they're so happy\nTo give up people that live in their country to it's like they're

rich thinks that Mexico somehow makes money on all of this really a ... ... we know that if Mexico is able to offload people that\nDrag their system down that it's a good thing for them but what do they get on people coming through their country from other Central American countries nah I I got to think that there's big money being made here and who knows you know\nWhat's so where's the money come from that come to these people they don't have any money that's why they say that I mean the ...\nYou know it's it's all of the Central American countries are corrupt and somebody's getting paid
