America is locked in a new kind of do a little Cold War with the Russians and the Chinese\nThe Russian Federation under a populist off the authoritarian leader seriously threatens the west through cyberspace and military ... thanks to that country's heavy investment in sophisticated mass killing weapons\nThe People's Republic of China\nIs a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on rapidly growing his nation economically and militarily and together China and Russia collaborate\nTo dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become the catalyst that leads to the prophetic and times\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis author of alliance of evil is here for hours one and two\nHours three and four and let's see what shall we do I thought maybe we could exchange some veal recipes\nThe republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just gives them a few crumbs we could have\nBrought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir ... and you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nHas really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nThey want to rise again they want to be a great power again and they do have them the means through their nuclear arsenal and of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that\nYou know we have a modern weapons systems\nThat really a push against the emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the oven guard a twenty time speed of sound a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a defense system\nWeapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back they are concerned about NATO and we did violate the initial trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves\nIn a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion handcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps\nSmoothing over relations pulling back from the brink if you will because now\nBecause everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House or that he has to be asked to appear\nAlmost overly aggressive against the Russian how much has this this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact putting said once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nAnd Helsinki this July uh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was the ridicule reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nThe United states I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower or not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and like\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries to take advantage of this but at the same time he does want stability he does wanting in attentions but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nWell let's pay the China you mentioned the trade wars are ... and how people need to appreciate how\nThis trade war strategy or terrorists uh against China is is not just economic it's also national security and that if I Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later in this and it tends to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't uh a cheese military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two\nEconomic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest to keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so have seen somewhat of a ... you know there are what six and a half percent growth\nIn the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters are but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property and Trump says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through your company the company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let\nOur wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different position so are there hopefully going to be within the month maybe in Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese media is is trying to figure out Trump and just like the\nAmbassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans advantage you always want to keep your opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that\nAnd then you call it an alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other uh components to Islamic terrorism perhaps an ... in terms of ... the Russians and the Chinese becoming a bed me is is driven by\nIdeology in any way or are there still vestiges of\nA communist ideology here or is simply about hedge them any\nWell as a combination of things uh I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy as it was I Would argue during the old Cold War I'm voting for his own either\nCommunism versus liberal democracy if it was I Would argue during the Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in where the nation is as opposed to what they would call an amoral west\nA and the things that they represent they paint the wife says what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and I said you don't want that in fact\nYou know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nYeah and and the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he you know even though he ... he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man\nIn the in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week you had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even\nStarted to you know hit\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent\nIn this case to serve the on twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh uh this past march you know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that food is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident in President Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as\nAn evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal why should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion predatory economics strategic extortion\nInformation warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and\nThere was a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking

end times finally arrived\nWho do you perceive us the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard as Russia and given their provocations\nBut also a military capability or which they're not shy to exercise around the globe I'm very you know the chief of naval operations animal rich\nYou know have said recently were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two the old Cold War with third one\nOr the Russians have put in place and nuclear submarine and you know a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost certainly hours not only in the\nAtlantic for the Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course are confronting enough militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines\nAre they're very aggressive in terms of fiber as we know all about the allegations in justifiably a sanctions put in place because with their interference from the twenty sixteen election in here recently or in the twenty Eighteen Mitt terms we arrested\nA I'm One of course this was a Chinese person\nAnd here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid term we arrested\nOr someone of course this was a Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are\nBellicose and they're you know claims against us and to a certain degree or we're pushing back you know President Trump's not a you know backing down and that I gave him if there's you know some given some take but maybe\nA it's not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all\nAh and then of course you joined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy ... an issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a\nWay of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe\nYou know do I say Russia is more dangerous now China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] while we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas now why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic weapons that are putting puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours\nUm but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and and the near future and are they willing to use it as well put and says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that's in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nYou know why the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen uh wants to fund a new counter to\nAh that to provide us the tactical capability in Europe so you've got all of these kind of flattering around there I I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nOr and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons\nOr that there that the mere threat the long term threatening especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with the defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok\nAnd I was twenty eight team joined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise these sorts of indicators that demonstrate that these two nations are\nPushing back against the former you know dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can\nCome up with the conclusion I think that perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry\nA and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course\nThough not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that clearly we don't have and we're trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony in border we want to go to war maybe World War three over in stone ya\nWell that's a that's why you know Trump has been over there you know of trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more and yeah you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need to all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia go in and and and disturbed that country and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one of the declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked or\nYou know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and in the light can we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so\nAh no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's\nCapability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need that may not have\nThe wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to a you know make these tough decision so\nUh that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in crime on next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts and NATO and\nAnd he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise] uh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nHad better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even Poland which is a you know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what\nThey did with Ukraine these are all issues of\nGreat a magnitude that hum we've got to decide and dust far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nLet's talk about China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president has accused the Chinese of of meddling in\nThe mid mid term elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states I'm\nThe big concern as I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about a Chinese made computer chips in components in electronics they may have a back door or even in US military equipment taught me about the series the seriousness of that threat\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly at the Pentagon you know the\nA defense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate said look you know even in these Chinese made you know phones you know ... you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges our ... our our stores are we're not going to buy certain items because we're suspect or that the Chinese have and somehow you know

I can never been out of the country I was raised in Indiana and\nAt ... in the middle of this country why should I feel this way Kennedy was shot in the head when I was maybe ten years old I remember that I was Catholic course I was that was a direct assault\nOn or you know a on me in the program and uh the uh the nine eleven and who\nYou know a Richard what's his name you know\nYou're ... you're fading out on me again Tom so I'm I'm Sorry I'm going to have to I'll respond but then I'm gonna have to want to thank you for the call well before Kennedy was McKinley and there was Garfield and there was Lincoln and there were\nMultiple attempts on other presidents um I don't know that that certainly something changed since Kennedy\nUm\nBut has much changed I think once\nThe United states\nAre sort of grew up in matured and became a major player certainly after the civil war or after the first World War and began to engage in multilateral trade organizations and\nUh did all of those things that some of the founding fathers sort of warning against foreign entanglements I think is what they called they called it a ... and this these sorts of\nUm\nGames dirty wars and so forth are almost inevitable when you become entangled in in uh in other countries' business and and you put yourself out there\nOr\nYou end up fighting wars on foreign lands so that those wars don't visit upon your own soil\nAnd yes it's it's nasty and dirty but one thing that the United states had I think that most other countries don't have and that is the power of redemption\nAnd I'm I'm a Canadian so I'm a bit of an internal over but I have strong emotional ties to the United states and I believe strongly in the idea of the United states and I believe in American exceptionalism it hasn't been fulfilled perhaps the way we'd like it but the United states\nYes\nThey they have been involved levy talking to lend day in Chile and the overthrow the government in ... in Iran in in in the in Nineteen fifty three and in Guatemala and so forth\nJust doesn't ... to the United states\nMost other countries that have the kind of a power and responsibility\nAt the United states has to do the same thing but they\nDon't reflect upon those those dark chapters in their history the way the United states does they don't talk about it on public forums they can't they're not allowed and there was no redemption at least in the United\nStates that exists\nWe reflect we're right we Sean and we try to make ourselves better and I think we should all be thankful for that Tom thank you for your call\nA Doug is east of the Rockies in the great state of New Jersey Doug welcome\nThank you very much our either through everything I'm well thank you\nI'm Glad to hear that I'm going to go a little bit off topic here um\nI tried to get married some time ago a there was a guest host them such as yourself and ah they were talking about climate change in a warming or garage things over the ocean now I'm not a\nA um you're not going to go either way with the pro or con on a global warning or anything like that\nBut uh they're talking about how the season the oceans are rising which ah that is the fact that it was a measure of all they can tell that\nBut I was wondering I've never heard anybody take into consideration water displacement every year we put billions upon billions upon billions of vessels in the water whether they be military whether it be giant a\nMulti ... a million dollar a cruise ships submarines we're sinking um subways out here on the east coast to make artificial reefs were sinking old military now this is taking up space\nAnd uh I Know that Hawaii has been having a volcano that has a stop for some time and that's also taken a while about taking of water but it's adding land\nAnd ah I I think if er if anybody a you know of or any of the guests that you've a hat on or hurt speak\nAbout this uh ever brought up the theory of water displacement\n[noise] uh no not that I'm aware of um I I think the type of sea level\nRise that they're talking about isn't about you know the the the the ice melting that's in the water because you know what happens when when ice cubes melt in a glass of water doesn't overflow\nI'm Talking about bits of ice shelves breaking off and so forth but\nOne eight hundred three eight seven nine nine zero three one eight hundred three eight seven nine nine zero three close to seven point\nOne the big talk more stimulating talk coast to coast Ninety seven point one the big Tucker more stimulating taught\nWelcome back to coast to coast am we're talking near death experiences in much more jarring or open lines the segment let's go to Dan in granite falls Washington hey Dan welcome good morning\nRichard yes at the near death but last many days I didn't have my ailments are or many and um I had an epiphany they saw something very important\nAll right what did you see I\nSaw a guy that for one thing I've ever been so much\nAnd I went through or damage of emotions I was listening to music eighties even a Raleigh low fat and I looked at to picture the two little girls I have my wall there that can be from\nSaint Jude long ago Gracie and rural area\nAnd they looked at them and I just kind of broke down and I've never been there have been a Christian a whole life and I've never been able to handle\nTheir pain like we came home home today to me and\nEven though I ... I have a terrible problem like I said father and there's a picture of you and I either\nThese little I cannot suffered and more of this and not go on what to do this ... this was going to go on for years and decades decade hundreds of years and I said it can't go on\nAnd I thought the promise\nI looked at the pictures I couldn't believe it I haven't smiled and daisy ad I smiled and the father who was saying to me it's not going to go on\nIt's going to end it if people just don't know that it's going to end very soon that\nThey are they're going to be standing in place where the lessons are going to be standing laying are sitting in their place and uh they're not going to know that we've come upon them if they're not ready for me\nAnd um that that's what's coming up my end or\nAn outlet I'm barely believe like a ... like a thief in the night\nOr twenty five years\nAnd ... was never diagnosed with HIV I was one of those I was lucky that I've been a long lived this long but when I went in\nDoctors and say you have HIV they said I went and like not feeling then they said you ate\nAnd I said you know highly although they go yeah that's what you have and I are calculated and I'm so grateful to the people of the United states of the world really people\nDon't think I think people like me are grateful I take um like um I've got a number here taking around a hundred and twenty\nThousand two hundred and twenty thousand\nOver twenty five years yeah and it kept you alive\nAnd it kept me alive and involved they deliver didn't go the hurt bad the lights are bad but the ah\nI ended up getting prostate cancer but ah I looked at the girl today and I have these these two girls are stuck to a thermostat I don't have any pictures because I've always been like pack and ready to leave\nThe third but I'm stuck in them is thermostats wine with the picture of Jesus it's talk left rate is lower row on a playwright and Mary lower right\nAnd uh\nAnd he just brought alone man and he said they're not so much longer if it's going to stop he's he's telling me it's going to stop even before you go even before I go\nAnd I think it ties into geopolitics it's going on today and I really do believe that maniac\nAnd I I don't want to use the cliche of the deep state I call him\nA I Would call them the maniacal money or I can tell you that on line the ... when I called money horrors of the world there are going to bring it about because they have said China and Russia to hold out\nAround of course the satellite state and if you are going to bow down to us and you are going to expect our way you're going to accept or corporation and all of our army\nOr there's gonna be a war\nAnd yesterday most Americans yeah\nFor ... and all of a norm are those are going to be a war\nAnd who you yesterday most Americans miss it when he said it did you catch that Richard when he said Russia when the war crime if we get a tax is that we're going to go to ... because Russia while I was\nI didn't catch that that's right that's right\nYou American and the worst singers you said you just drop dead where you stand\nHe said to me no time to repent I heard that pretty dire warning\nAbout girls and the girl in the fathers are you there is there a lot of suffering and very very early\nAlright Dan thank you so much for for sharing that it's a it's a dire warning but also a\nA a really a testament to your courage twenty five years even George the suffering and I appreciate your calling in and sharing that story with us a Joe is in Monterey, California Joe good morning\nIt's MORNING Richard ... thank you for taking my call okay um I Do a lot of healing work a solo travel or healing or\nAnd or some of my clients um I get them to travel out of the body to their past lives uh actually it's called uh spiritually aggression or a spiritual travel they're not using the actual body they're using their soul or conscious um [noise]\nIt's a a super conscious mind that's a soul is in the very high state\nAh as for the process of crossing over usually people come to a gate\nA gateway and are they are met either by their guide or maybe a family member um if they don't cross over a they will either told to go back or maybe they make talked to someone and they usually come back into the body you know near that\nNot a full death experience but there are books written about life between license which which I Do life between allies [noise] although most people don't do that they don't call on me to help them do that they rather do some healing work\nAnd some of the things that we do is work with angels and arcane rules and they're healers and sometimes they're guides\nSo as far as uh do we\nDo we how do we continue to live\nYes we do a more importantly we can experience happened we can experience what it's like the crossover would out dying by going through some kind of spiritual regression and going into ... life between lies and it's extremely liberating and you do get\nTo see what your life's purpose what you're supposed to be doing here you meet a council um who interview you um you go through a\nA kind of I'm I'm a healing in preparation which are guide 'em before you meet councils and before you go and places or any other places because you you\nWe'll all meet your soul family and other being's that you've a date you make contact with\nAnd yes you can see your records or this is when you're in what people called heaven and it's it's really happened is a very powerful experience and um when people feel a presence when they're at the gate is usually the light\nOf heaven and yes or they people well within this light a when they go through the what we call the gateway um and uh you start to acclimate yourself in that world\nAnd um there's a lot of a pill a path to communication so there's no facade so to speak there's no lying because people know each other you know they know who you are to a lot of soul level because you're so\nRight on Joe let me ask you a couple of questions do you believe in reincarnation\nTop I work with that law All right well how long\nTypically does someone spend in his life between lives before they reincarnate\n[noise] now that there is within the individual and uh you don't immediately come back you go and you go through a process you meet your guys you find out what life\nYou
