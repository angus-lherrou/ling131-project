empowered me and and taught me how to do it myself\nSo I just you know I picked it up really quickly and I I mean the rest is history I feel very very confident with with\nWhat I Do you know with the spells it I've been executing so that's how I got started it was it was more about healing and then that's when she just introduced me to it and now I feel like well I probably don't need a healer because I'm I'm using magic as a form of healing\nHave you ever ... but he never\nAnd I want to make that very clear that I Will never ever ever cast a spell to hurt anyone um to try to bring love my way to try to win the lottery [laughter] isn't that what\n... what what what ... and if you don't learn anything\nYou know I think that the power of our minds\nBecause I have discovered one thing I have discovered with magic is that in\nMy mind is more powerful than I realized so I think that when we start healing on so many different levels\nThat we will be able to tap into unlimited amounts of financial abundance and spiritual abundance so I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will conjure up a money spell and work that but right now I've just been focused on doing the um healing and on crossing and reversal\nWhen you talk about magic what do you what are we talking about we're not talking about David Copperfield we're talking about something else are we\nAbsolutely and it can

second with her courses so we're talking about this demonic situation and you said it wasn't going well what was happening\nAt that point I was ten down on my bed and then all of a sudden what it felt like hours of course all of a sudden I fell on my ear going up and down I don't know if his paw\nOr a hand for it\nBut it was going up and down on my left ear and so it was really really crazy so at that point it was either fight or flight and I obviously couldn't sleep because I Would tend down\nSo this wave of courage just came over me and I just thought you know I I I I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just fall and as soon as I\nI made that adjustment in my mind right I I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just peeled off of me and at that moment with my right arm\nI jus warmed up [laughter] like when I went up and I'm not kidding George I felt a hairy leg that is insane\nIt's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone but it just like it flew away obviously\nThat's freaky it is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't believe me but\nI did go back to that psychic woman it looked like what happened but yeah it's so freaking and I will say it never happen again after that time so I Know that this man something that even intend to my way but I did not sleep without the light off for about three months after that it totally terrified me who\n... who is susceptible to demonic possessions and in situations like that it's ... well you know\nI'm not going to let's say the obvious ones like people doing drugs or having a cocktail or drunk or shine\nYeah we're we're going to the ... cemetery at you know and having a cocktail at midnight [laughter] but I Will say that um\nThere is one reason I think that\nMany by the way you ever to laugh you don't have a tackle which uh which should have a capital you don't have\nA which is actually a wise woman so that's the definition of a wage but yeah I think you [noise] um\nI kind of wanted a ... but that's all right [laughter] I Can't do it even if I\nTried and so one of the reasons that I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand I'm considering we all lived thousands of lifetimes on and I'm Glad I haven't remembered any of them on some of these lifetime so we were not the best of people\nAnd um it's very possible that this is my theory that could be wrong but I have proof for my showman who kind of confirmed um my you know my thoughts about this and it's very possible that some of these people these victims who are experiencing what is known as karma\nSo they can be you know\nHarassed and molested in this lifetime with the team and the danger with in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in his lifetime and\nThe demon that how it is usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I'd ever heard of the demon die unless you like\nOff you cast them out but the they don't buy that\nIt's usually a long time I mean I don't think I'd never heard of a demon die unless you've like slate\nCash them out but they don't\nExactly there's thousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at George it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demon and what's going to happen when we read incarnate and the demon is going to probably harassed them and molest him now that's\nOne one theory and I can say\nWith confirmation that it's it's it's probably very true because my sharman has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days\nHas a lot of cases of of people who are being molested harassed and just you know possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a ... journey\nInto their past lives and nail it and nine times out of ten these people have made packs with demons or they were maybe a big\nPowerful black which and you know I don't know it's it's it's different for each of them but for the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does is she just\nBreaks that agreement that they can finally be free\nAnd um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in this situation and you know these demons or not bothering her neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified sharman who can really just put an end to this\nWhat are these dark for she wants to ... ... what do they want\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity duty we'd also absolutely and I'm sadly a lot of black\nMagicians will cast spells against people who they feel they can steal light from and they can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and the book into us however they do it and what this does it will make their incorrect magic\nMore potent so this is why it is extremely important especially right now\nUm to to really really really really clear ourselves on a daily basis and do ... rituals prayers and and ...

so\nStand you wrote a book with Kathleen Martin was the niece of Benny Hill called captured which is still for me one of the greatest UFO stories of abductions I've ever read it is one of the reasons I got into this business\nBecause when look magazine came up with the interrupted journey or the story in Bahrain Benny Hill I mean I was just mesmerized even at a young age\nHow would you categorized that case the Barney and video case\nWell I think it's a very important case and for several different reasons I'm\nOn the people are not talking about people who don't have a reputation and we're not talking about people who are trying to seek attention for ... sake but he was a social worker or respected member of the community\nShe had a mixed marriage with Barney ... she was white that was very unusual in the early sixties it took guts for them to\nCome out and that's right and\nThey were very concerned about what the reaction would be ... this was in the early sixties and you know you got to ... if you're going to have people who set a new standard of what's going on ... you got to have people who can handle heats speak\nIt's unfortunate that Barney didn't live terribly long time in Nineteen sixty eight I guess and uh\nI'm Betty I'm Around a long time for which I Am glad and uh it was a good case to set the ball rolling so to speak on the whole business of options interactions with\nNot sensationalize\nI mean what's rates you stand back and say better than Barney were specimens for somebody and they weren't treated but they certainly weren't going off and glory and claiming all kinds of multi things as being\nPart of their interaction with the ... and\nYou know [noise] I I was fortunate to have the opportunity to meet them early on\nIt and I I was very impressed and I was impressed by something else a medium in that case I mean in Pittsburgh biggest station in town and uh\nYou know I I that's where I made my view on the air so to speak\nAnd they called me and told me that they were bringing Betty morning in town and\nTold they were they were staying and which is very unusual yeah like contact with them we had dinner together\nOr just the three of us and I had a chance to you know one on one kind of thing and I was very very impressed and I had known what to expect because I haven't dealt with stuff like this I mean\nIf there was a little bit crazy story aliens grab the ... an interracial couple\nIn those days you were just getting into this field weren't you\nWell yeah I mean you don't you dare done a pretty early on was early yeah\nIn the sixties and it's no longer in the sixties or seventies\nOr eighties [laughter] that's right no till I was\nVery fortunate to have met them one on one so to speak and I saw it in the ... conferences\nI was very fortunate to have met them one on one so to speak and I saw it in the ... conferences I didn't get too many meetings with for a new cars he died within two years when I first met him a lesson that\nAre very has gone on and of course I work very closely with that he's nice Kathleen Martin and we've done three books together [noise] and uh\nThat's been a pleasure to uh it's not often you find it can break with people uh have co written books ... with other people but uh we seem to be compatible\nYeah you you you too clicked and she's great in in the field that you follow due to a career she's super permission\nYou don't gamble when I was that Twenty one year old reporter who interviewed you one of the other interviews I did was with Dr Benjamin Simon who ... who was the psychiatrist who\nWho studied Betty and Barney hill and this is I'll I'll always remember this because he was in Boston I interviewed him over the phone I'm In Detroit\nAnd in ... you know I'm I'm obsessed with the story and I asked him I said so what do you think Dr\nA ball they're telling you the truth or not what do you think he said\nI I don't know if the story happened or not but I Will tell you what I Do believe\nThey're they're not lying whatever happened to them both of them on under hypnosis separately told the same story\nAnd they they believe whatever they saw happened to them and he said based on that I cannot say what happened but I can tell you they aren't lying to me in a what an amazing story\n... ... we have to remember that the doctor Simon random facility for three thousand shell shocked war veteran yes called the ...\nWere way before anybody would get involved and stuff like that\nYeah and he had learned to use ... means of bringing guys who had terrible experiences you know your buddy said on off next year battle [noise] ah that's traumatic but\nWeeds and so he learned how to handle this and so they were very fortunate and winding up his hands and\nYou know I I'm Still not sure exactly what he finally thought about the whole business but he surely thought that these people are an online that's right there was not\nLooking for attention cetera et cetera\nI was impressed with him and uh I was a personal better than Barney two and a warning to ideal ... and uh unfortunately but they but they were they had nothing to gain a mixed couple in the United states in the early sixties\nWas not parading itself around the world when they were asked to come out so to speak to resist a reporter with the story out\nMuch to their surprise I'm relieved ... they were treated fine and they found out around the world and that's the thing that I have a look I lecture to Nineteen countries\nIt's given me a pretty good handle on one of the people and think about the subject of flying saucers aliens or you know visitors from someplace else\nAnd I found I just haven't had bad reactions you\nKnow and if anything it's getting even stronger I think
