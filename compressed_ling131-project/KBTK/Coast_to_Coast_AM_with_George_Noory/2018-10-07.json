... that's what you do you you would if you were at that beach hanging out there with them you would just be just dying to\nLose it I mean I can relax a little bit the despite you know despite what my friends will tell you I can relax I can show but you know I'll give you one quick example I was in New Finland are about ten years ago and I was there with\nA friend of mine were traveling around looking icebergs and part of the reason that I went there was because ah there's been a series of lobsters are the have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are they washed up there but I also wanted to go investigate some of that in the oval Spring Hill jak signing up there but as I was up there I came across um of a place called lake crushed and\nUm and it's this little you know in Finland is it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot\nA metal sculpture thing for this thing as you enter the town in the town of the population is like three or four or something\n[laughter] I rented a car I'm like I\nPut on the brave I gotta I I Can't pass a lake monster come on cry and you know my friend rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\n[laughter] well it's better than stopping for the biggest you know world's biggest a ball of yarn or something like that right [laughter] right I'm with you [laughter]\nThat's great okay so I'm I'm before I go on you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween so I I Googled that ... found your article that even written 'cause you you do a lot of writing your author of course\nBut you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too but I saw this great article\nFrom you and I was like oh my gosh here's the game you know and so it looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody who was writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so so tell me about the origins now we're ... we're just now learning the origins of Willis wean the jealousy origins of the Halloween\nSee ... I I I Want the two hundred years from now when people are researching the oranges will if when\nThey're going to come up with this conversation I'll love it my grandkids will be be all over it will be like that I Know\nOne of the things that I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not\nBig on the on the holidays meaning of Christmas is fun ... but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamental is the the the conservative from time to get all touchy about that 'cause they think it's really the the cult which is not but it's it's what it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into\nAnd that's where I really love about Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy as a fascinating history\nI'm so basically Halloween\nA ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of full Couric\nThese events and holidays there is not just one street line back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime but basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic or deal with festival called a fellow in [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much um infringed about just because\nSo long ago and there is no the film ... records or pre Sparky fragmentary but it's basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest\nAnd it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the sauces and at the time when I'm you know the the the snow's falling in you know plants are dying\nUm so it had this connection to uh to darkness\nBut it wasn't sinister by modern standard when we ... we think we think of the dark as being something after but to them there was very it was more carbon an analyst point of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons um\nAnd so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so it wasn't scary it was like yes the time to you know to store it rains and to you know give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this and that [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the um uh the the the separation between the world's with especially thin porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other hand you know the the ferry boat or what have you on the world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day be the the er the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise]\nUm and so this is why are the the began talking about how\nSpirits would a would come come forth on this day and people were much more likely to be able to ah the spirits and they were basically all around us and it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world are porous\nUm the the barrier between them but also\nI'm In a leader incarnations of Halloween it was also at a time it's porous and so what you find is that a pool would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when\nI Would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's ... there are there other worlds but it's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different customs that would involve the Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them but there were ideas for example that the that are for example a woman born a Halloween would be able to tell the future\nUm and there would be a proxy and often times the prophecy a was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was often times there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would be with the way the candle for a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look in the mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection [noise]\nUm and so all these sorts of another one example was a bombing for Apple you know if you're not near the apple bobbing and there was there was a particular Halloween tradition that if you cut appear if you killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and pass in prison coming together\nOn my way man I gotta write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night actually I Do it you know the midnight ride\nOn my willfully night that's right will swing and [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um\nI'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to you know I I get there are people that say Halloween a saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that they're they're cool with it you know\nBut um you know I always see it as fun I see it\nAs a I I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think\nA cool jak a lantern that you get to make I think a fall whether I think of orange and black collars yeah I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which isn't the goblins and and the theory fun fun things\nThat's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and all of a sudden they kicked the fun out of it and the traditions out of that and and uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're gonna have to take a break here but what we have is a band rapper with us\nHe is an investigator and an end to all the things that were into a has coast the folks here that want to learn everything um but he also you know there's a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn\n\n\n\n\nThe financial studios you're listening to Ninety seven what was it she she only thing that we feel is worse humiliating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] um [noise] um [noise] um [noise] um [noise] um\nYou're listening to Russia's week in review\nThe drive by and really you know like in the media the mainstream me in the\nDemocratic Party [noise]\nAnd it was not possible for economic growth ever be above the best it was under Obama which was one point eight to ... percent\nOf my hand want an outlier wonder a little over three percent were raining circumstances there Obama's reading the average one point eight to ... percent at the end\nOf the outside\nAnd everybody said it can't possibly get any better of an ad and it's foolish to think so it's a new day in America and those days of ... very capitalistic economic growth or over just like Obama and the media said the jobs that weight loss manufacturing otherwise would never ever be coming back\nObama goes out to Elkhart, Indiana telling people in the campaign year or two thousand sixteen not to think if there are jobs coming back to the Trump lying to them about\nIt asking what's it going to do we have about ... what what was going to go to ... oh you are\nA boss oh out here\nWell we got an economic growth in Austin stand a four point two percent and climbing the stock markets are rushing into a record high because done all this Trump last night\nThat deadline that he is that we have a new trade deals with Canada\nTo be added into the deal already reached what may call it is what gets rid of NAFTA just asked he said he would do just as he promised on the campaign trail the new name of this thing\nIs the United states Mexico Canada agreement or us and we'll see a\nTrump has been speaking about this for the last half hour outside the oval office\nAnd he is in a fine fine mood as is everybody gathered there it is a major major achievement again it is something that the Democrats opposition which includes of course the media all said could not happen\nIt couldn't be done it was a waste of time to try and they said scratching their heads why just Trump care about trade deals anyway and they've never understood the Trump voter caring about trade deals they never understood the connection Trump made an maintains\nSo there you have it it's um it's not a sexy subject\nNAFTA never was I mean it was in the command that a lot of attention a it was very controversial when it was ratified in the in the early in the mid Nineteen nineties\nBut in terms of being a subject of cable news announcer gonna do it two or three panels tonight on NAFTA trade deal and not going to have a lot of people\nTune in it's just the way of the world so Trump is making sure with this extended event in the rose garden to David people get its importance in terms of its important as an election issue it's crucial\nIt is a I wouldn't say crucial but it's it's very important in terms of Trump being able to say to his voters stick with me\nI told you I was going to do this I told you it can be done and I told you the United states was going to come out as the champion in the subject of World Trade don't doubt me and in that sense\nIt's a confidence inspiring that Trump left alone in the oval office free and clear to be who he is will me in a bunch of great things happening\nFor the country and this can be part of land in to any number of\nCampaign ads\nFor the upcoming their terms because it's going to be about a lot of things not just the Kavanaugh nomination and other things that this is going to be a fundamental aspect in terms of turning out the\nThe Trump base now the drive by is you know there there was a Trump had a simple ask here no questions about Kavanaugh's during the NAFTA thing and I and info bay from the drive by media persistent\nIn trying to start questions about Kevin on which has led to a discussion about a Trump now talking about the FBI investigation and I have to you know\nJumping the gun a little bit in on this comment but\nI'm from friday\nAfternoon the minute by minute we learn that the FBI was going to be called on to do another week's worth of investigating\nIt was a mountain lake clear to me what all of this is\n\nAnd it's simply about one word folks it's about the way to lay and delay and with each new revelation\n... need to continue to delay its secondarily about Kavanaugh that yeah oh there's no targeting Kevin offered total nuclear destruction\nThat's part and parcel of this to the way it worked very simple you have Jeff Flake secondhand Cohen's have struck a deal\nThat would be a one week FBI investigation of the claims made by Christine balls the Ford\nNever mind the fact\nThat she never she doesn't have any evidence to back up or Clinton never mind the she is not credible\nTo another thing is grading on me hearing everybody to drive by media tell she's credit credible allegation of ... no it's not credible but she's being automatically assumed an described as credible and of course cabinet is not\nCatalog Kevin O's not credible she is she has no evidence to back this up more cooperation at all\n\nSo the FBI says okay we'll do this for a week\nAnd immediately before sundown on friday a bunch of Democrats are all of a week isn't long enough\nTo be silly\nTo limit this than Trump right on cue said I haven't limited the FBI NBC is lying but I haven't limited the FBI and the scope\nMeaning now Trump's on record and everybody is and if this thing needs to be on the week while it's going to go beyond a week and I guarantee you that is the objective here and that's why new allegations about Kavanaugh's being a wild violet drunk need to trace that\nDown cabin on may be having committed perjury about his calendars and stuff well we got a track that down I'm Kevin ... may not have the temperament to be on the court given how in the range just angry\nHe was during his testimony of the Judiciary Committee we've got to track that down it's delayed delayed delayed delayed delay and it's going to be tougher and tougher and tougher to hold of this Friday vote\nSo people are going to end the Republican Santa gonna have to get sort of steel for a backbone and shut this down at some point or it's just going to continue to be delayed delayed and to lay it\nYou're listening to Rush Limbaugh big voice on the rise tumbled ... feet met for\nCyber criminals cyber bad guy

all part of the strategy to turn him\nAnd it was never ... there was a three point strategies a flake strategy was number three if the other two had bombed out\nAnd they made it they pulled it off they did it\nJohn Fund has a piece today at National Review who was behind the flakes set up\nAcorns tactics live on and the senators elevator confrontation with activists from George Soros backed

was one of the three points of the strategy that's a ... left wing activist group some might have been seven or eight of them on this conference call\n\nThe two women were Anna Maria are ... and Maggie Gallagher the two women who confronted like inside the elevator perhaps because the women expressed such raw emotion few media outlets dug into their political activism they didn't want to dig into their political activism they wanted to portray them as average ordinary American women it just happened to get into the building\nThey didn't want anybody to know that one Democrat activists they know they were a Democrat activists CNN knew this look everybody's in on this this whole thing is a gigantic set up\nThe Democrats don't care about a minute or FBI investigation that's just a trick from or the way Kevin O's already undergone six\n\nSix background information of background checks on Capitol I'll miss the fact that he was such a drunk he beat people up which is the latest allegation somebody you knew him at Yale\nGuys now a professor in North Carolina has a piece of the Raleigh News Observer that Kavanaugh got belligerent lead drunk and he is seen it well\nNobody has any ... information on on Kavanaugh and his drinking in the last Twenty years old that happened was that Kevin ... ended up number one in his\nClass in high school\nIn college and in law school somebody so drunk so sloppy planning his next gang rape I'll guarantee you that kind of person does not become number one in anything decent a capital was\nHe was number one in his class in high school and college in the law school capital has achievements Ninety percent of us wouldn't even bother to dream about\nThey are so daunting most of us wouldn't even attempt to them\nThey have to go back to high school and go back to college to find evidence of binge drinking do that you're going to find binge drinking on the part of a lot of people you're gonna find evidence like that today because don't you\nKnow ... and jumps don't you know the stress of life in America is so so bad it's so horrible that there's all kinds of self medication going on all kinds of people are drinking\nAnd they make excuses for them because the pressure is so intense but\nYou don't find anybody testify Mitt Kavanaugh's Venice\nFall down beat him up drunk the last twenty five or Thirty years do you or even beyond that\n\nNext they said he he may have committed perjury if he lied about the people on that count wonder Andrea he lied about what those terms mean if he is committed perjury\nHe is gone we need the FBI to look into that we need the FBI look into whether or not he beat people up on jails campus and we need we need to really track down this judicial temperament of his why you see the way he acted on our committee hearing on friday he was yelling and screaming that's not the kind of temper we want from a judge\nOr my buddy Andy McCarthy makes a great point if you want to test if you want to see cabinet those judicial temperament there's a place you can go\nAnd it is called the DC circuit court of appeals where Kavanaugh has been serving for years and all you have to do is go there and study his work and then to the courts prior to that where he was a judge\nAll of this is the ... the way the way they hope to find new women drag new women out with new allegations they hope to come up with new charges\nThe ... minute one week's additional one week FBI investigation was agreed to the Democrats started saying one week isn't going to be enough we we can't well we can was enough for thousands and hundreds of thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails James Comey is even gotten on this\nJames combing now making no doubt about his partisanship and this and here's never Trump anti Trump status which is what all of this really is if you if you boil all this down what this is folks\nHatred for Donald Trump by\nThe Washington establishment by the American left and by the media on adults are rated\nThough looted Raul poisonous hatred Brett Kavanaugh is going to be destroyed in the process of damaging and getting rid of Donald Trump\nThey wanted to lay this beyond the midterms 'cause they aren't convinced they're going to win and when they when the and the Senate House instead of making a pitch Trump they can paralyze the rest of his administration and if uh if if if if Kavanaugh what happened to get on the court to go to teach him to Gerald Nadler who run to the Judiciary Committee for the Democrats\nIn the house he's not even the chairman he's the ranking member and he's already promising to impeach Kavanaugh\nFor perjury and whatever else that has occurred so far if the Democrats win the house\nThey can't stand it they cannot stand that Donald Trump is president they cannot stand that Donald Trump is putting a tremendous absolutely great human being and conservative on the Supreme Court is driving them hysterically crazy\nAnd so all of this all these new charges all these new sing Justin's for investigation all these calls for more time all it is is delay the next time you hear\nKevin oil is reported we're very frequently in college and gotten rock and hit the ball in the face\nSubstitute one word for that delay this is all about continuing to delay it which is why it is and he is as it has always been at some point the Republicans would love to shut this down\nAnd call for a vote now as anybody else like me concerned I mean the FBI leadership many of them are gone but a lot of snow there has done its level best to screw with Donald Trump\nWorking with the intelligence agencies we had that ball conducting a silent cool\nTo get rid of Trump during the campaign and then destroy his transition and they have been trying to destroy his presidency was phony Russia collusion the mother investigation and all that now that same agency\nWith James calling me with an email now encouraging them to dig deep key taken keep digging told me he says there's gotta be something they're\nThe same guy that exonerated Hillary Clinton without even an interview with the same guy that said they've found new questionable emails on the laptop of Carlos danger and in a matter of three days reviewed a hundred thousand of them to find there was nothing there so they can do whatever they're going to do in a day or two if they want to\nBut then what happens if the FBI looks into all of this and reports by the way they reached no conclusions and if they do that we'll know\nA lot but if in the ... the ... the the the forms and the results with interviews\nIf they produce no evidence\nChristine Blasey Ford if they produce no evidence for any other allegation if they cannot produce anything that says Kevin ... did it whatever it is\nThis investigation clears Kevin like every FBI investigation here to forehead you think the Democrats because oh okay well good we got a week now we can vote you think that's what's going to be the hell no\nThey're going to say the investigations not thorough the investigation was stilted by Trump the investigation was cheating the investigation was not long enough whatever they're not going to accept anything here at some point they're going to have to be treated as the minority they are and\nAll of this just shut down and both you're listening to Rush Limbaugh
