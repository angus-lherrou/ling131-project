salary\nI I you know\nLove to say I know everything about this I have no idea if the doctors were in on it I Do know that in Nineteen fifty seven Eleanor Roosevelt\nHad was tired of hearing the swirling around Washington DC about that they are being murdered I'm definitely not the first one to come up with this um and she commissioned a private investigator to uh to the bottom of his death so I Do know that um\nThe private investigator hit a dead end all of FDR's medical records were were stolen from a locked filing with us though\nSo one of four people had those keys one of them was a doctor and uh it was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote a\nThe uh the book being um the White House physician and that was a rather MRI's mcentire were they in on the murder habits only new idea I I I couldn't say I have to say that they had good intentions they were just a little bit little ignorant maybe and\nAnd what happened to ... the Russian painter and her driver and and and um she which has been\nWell they just kind of disappeared into obscure I mean at the time or to afterwards\nWell immediately afterwards well they packed up the uh um\nRobbins and shuts off and they

still records you know and there's a parallel here to the FDR's or to the JFK thing actually\nUm JFK shot in Dallas they break law to bring him to a out of Dallas the autopsy should have been performed in Dallas\nThey break law to bring him to besides the\nNow the law was the same in Nineteen sixty three it was it was a Nineteen forty five they did the same thing they broke the law removing FDR's body from Georgia bringing it to the ... with us so both you know both the JFK and FDR's body I removed a legally\nThey're both at but says though we're all kinds of fun things happen you know this the first that couldn't talk you know and they they rushed this guy it's it's a little less than sixty nine hours from FDR's death\nTo him in the open being buried they couldn't get this guy's body in the ground fast enough\nNor do by the way and no one bombing\nNo autopsy knowing bombing it's just easier\nAnd crazier and crazier all the way through so I mean and there's other things in history to Richard I mean take a look at 'em you know not just this I'm going to be working on Princess Diana coming up next but there are other presidents in history who I also believe that the murder that say glossed over um\nWarren Harding Warren Harding was it was it was obvious this guy was murdered and there's another one that we thought about but as far as FDR's concern\nI mean the the [laughter] the information in my head just exploded when I started digging and digging and digging and it's still it's still boggles my mind you know the book is going to publish for a little while now and I still even after the book is one published\nYou know I'll find a new fact and how they should have put that in the book I mean there's got\nTo be a volume three perhaps uh let me get the

it wasn't a warfare and with Roosevelt because that would have been too quick\nYeah it was it wasn't people around him they were disposing of with war for him because it and she's right she's right I mean it's been the blood out to to the point where if you touch a person they'll get\nYou know either their their brains will either bleed or they'll have an ... or something or a cerebral hemorrhage and they'll also and of course I Know Dr but no my parents were both on it they're both on a variety of blood and are so\nRight my late father was as well sure not necessarily caused brooding with any

progression so he would be someone that we talk about that new the new deal is [noise]\nI um I go in the right thing around that that got off for that show called the great depression anti like start killing ... and last late ... about\n... a direction connection and shy about FDR and they are carrying stable genius if you will and the White House it's\nChanged somewhat different because I live with the camera and then they shouldn't have to have more to do it leading up even though he wound up as president and of course the money that he had to go to and county election Saudi Arabia I like going to get one lab but right\n... and ended up calling me I don't see a fifty fifty shot you know we know that he has a ... and then\nWell my I had if I could just jump in because we're not talking about Trump I think if it's enough to put words in your mouth but I think it'd be kind of facetious\nOr about the Russian connection with Trump like let's just to FDR way we can do a whole show perhaps another time on on the Russian dos and so forth but and you're right ... a big fan of FDR I Know Webster of them and I've had dinner with him and and he waxes on about the new deal\nUh obviously Steve you're you're not a fan did you have anything to add\nUh no I don't know the man I Would love to meet him sometime uh as far as the new deal I think it was probably the right thing at the time I think it was an experiment I don't think anybody knew how it was going to go 'cause I Am to my knowledge there's never been done before so I mean it\nI have no doubt that they thought at the time it was a really good thing it helped a lot of people\nUm it just wasn't along sustaining campaign so as far as the Russians and the current administration yeah I was kind of little facetious as to how how everyone is in history you kind of repeats itself what kind of doesn't you know um it's it's amazing how we have the [laughter]\nWe were right back in the same thing we have another red scare and in the country and it's really it's really something else if only Joseph Joseph ... realized you know he would he\nWould really enjoy this I think\nRight so I think the point you're making there was that the the Russian connection during FDR's time was overt uh and today it's I guess you would quaint a phrase from ah CNN is nothing burger\nI mean if I mean if they ever prove it with from which I don't know if they're ever going to um they may I don't know I'm not privy to that information but it's it's just interesting how\nHow old the two of the history is another red scare it's

to hold highly publicized San says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nNothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... as your Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA door oil was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an avowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend uh and his wife or were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was\nThe oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother and Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important\nIn this whole thing um and Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI was he sort of outed her in public didn't need any ... ...\nYeah yes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow that part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience was how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photo psychic act or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coded method\nThat that Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody method\nI think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of\nCan words and the tenth word is actually a phrase in\nEach word corresponds to a number number one through can and number can can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly to date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry in best\nThey used to point most commonly\nThe date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry and best first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married they\nWould do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reach in their pocket political point although I Would have to laugh too did you find the coin and they these were rich\nAnd pray answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sentence like quickly Harry I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural miss to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins at best held in her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight and because she would say she's communicating to him verbal using these code words and she said quickly\nQuickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eight word in in the ... so so that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right makes says right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing and pretend but the way of doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now ... please be quickly look be quick and as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical\nDot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work yes he's posted there sorry Hi and\nThere's a link on the coast of now let's talk about this call because after the message was delivered to pass and she said that it works somebody quickly said hey this was all in a book is all already published in a book this is no big\nDeal well I thought and I read this on line\nA number of times someone would say within the book but they wouldn't say the name of the book out of the people were saying it's on page da da da da di ... created and then I finally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look\nIn the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county and\nFor all of twenty five cents they would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out an eighty five year old book I couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just follow that may not say there's a link inside there to show you scan of this book and so that book does talk about those ten words\nAnd how it's used to form numbers but not out a form we're\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book\nAnd um it see I hear a bullet points about this that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow the corporate coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coded word rose about that a secret message with in code the word the leaves and the actual\nSecret ten word message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is he also is a famous magician and he's a close personal friend Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book\nEveryone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why was important to point out\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini a and therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that\nBecause now we get into the sale and and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this is actually true but allegedly told them that ... I'm a skeptic I I I'm going to bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way\nI can get a message to bass I Will try and then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he how did for get in touch with best\nWell out such an interest in it but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked\nBecause bass and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... who we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions\nNineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise] one of his clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and\nIn his mind putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have and she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother\nTo show him that his mother's soul or spirit was surviving gap and so this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither best Houdini nor Arthur forward pursued this any more they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford was well aware of Houdini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and\nMorning noon or night cardio mobile that you take on limited medical grade EKG go ahead and enjoy the peace of mind\nFor your time today for just Ninety nine dollars mythic cardio dot com K.

E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... writes um she had an apartment and she invited\nArthur Ford over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in the closet but there is hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange well the person that shows up is not really author Fort it's someone that's been paid in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says ah I paid\nMrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because bats heard about it well the reporter wrote this up\nSo bass responded in a letter 'em to that same paper where she just completely denies that there she's been a party of fraud in\nAny way and if Arthur Ford said that they were in cahoots he's a liar\nI mean she's very clear in this letter goes on and on and I had never seen this letter until um yesterday\nIt's in an article posted on a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nThis was written to Walter wind chill the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the social ... go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the Newark evening graphic but it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters\nLetter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity you know I'm just telling you I was no party Danny fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he confessed\nAnd then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened in one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this\nYou know they don't believe in your communication you know and so and I think that this faster\nAnd she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends being labeled and not um and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going\nTo go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like if anyone says they get in touch with me after my death and know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise] um so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the say on twenty nine was she re camping and changing your position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up I'm an award a reward the ten thousand dollar prize to any one to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if he really wasn't boots with Arthur Ford he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened\nI retracted the offer well that sounds you know pretty\nNobre I was in survival mode your football can help you want to hail storm but the guy go insurance agency can help you get coverage for personal property damage and go I go to see our board of all homeowners insurance can\nBe many big scare me to vampires where walls children not one bit\nBut you know it does scare me downtime inefficiency scare the living daylights out of me that's why use Granger are America's number one source for industrial supplies plus they've got the inventory management solutions that keep us running so we've got up time we've got a fish and see we got productivity when it comes to keeping your facility running rangers got your back\nColor quick ranger dot com to see for yourself creature from the\nCBC Jay to cheat a village\nSilly running rangers got your back color quick ranger dot com to see for yourself creature from the\nCBC Jay ... cheetah village Ninety seven Ford won the big shocker for love or a financial studios northern Arizona for stimulating taught\n[noise]\nIn Georgia I'm Pam who sales Fox News the fatal shooting of a police officer has authorities in Georgia looking for a teenager officer and Antoni was killed yesterday in ... county\nHad officers or go out on this vehicle Charlotte approach the shots were fired shots [noise]\nWhen it county police sergeant Jake Smith police believe Eighteen year old sorry Maynard ups Melville fired the shots a second Tina's under arrest for aggravated assault related to a separate incident\nAfter the shooting in South Carolina more than two dozen people or heard after all floor collapsed overnight during a party inside a clubhouse Clemson police say none of the injuries is life threatening\nPresident Trump keeping the pressure on his political opponents\nDemocrat Party has become an angry roof was on the edge mop determined to get by any means necessary [noise] the\nPresident wrapping up a series of rallies in the west that one in Nevada where Senate Republican Dean Heller is facing a tough challenge from democratic congresswoman Jackie rose and Democrats also hitting Nevada hard\nAbout how old are your your your never efforts are spreading a lecture goes as consequential as the election actually and locally\nFormer vice president Joe Biden in Las Vegas former President Obama will visit Vegas tomorrow deadly election disruptions in Afghanistan where a roadside bomb killed nearly a dozen civilians including several children today is a parliamentary elections got underway yesterday the first twenty ten\nThe LA Dodgers and the Boston Red Sox for me to stay for game one of the world series the Dodgers knocking off the Milwaukee Brewers last\nNight this is Fox News [noise]\nThis is ...

Silver is continuing report that he was on um the five thirty eight dot com politics podcast\nAnd the host was Jody ever gotten who is a guy and the question has the gender gap increased since Kevin ...\nA lot of takes on Kavanaugh on the effect that he had are drawn by like male pundits who are in almost social\nNetworks right especially for Republicans where the Republican kind of consultant and pollster and an expert community is very male journalists are pretty male has hasn't changed that much maybe a little bit improved\nUntil the conventional wisdom about like the effects Kevin Will have I think are governed by that\nA lot in our forecast you now see a clear split between the house in the Senate where the G ... summit chances continue to improve but\nThe Democrats house chances actually are back on the upswing now kind of sense of the cabinet nomination\nA ... it's it's kind of not like it's kind of just the Kavanaugh fight has energized Republicans far more than Democrats and all of these house races\nThe Democrats are showing their voters are locks\nThey're too close to call right now there's a whole bunch of them are too close to call this isn't in the bag for them but they're voters need to be told that it is they've set that up\nThey've been on this blue wave business for so long that if they come off of them even a bit that causes a crisis of confidence among the Democrat voting base they can't do that but folks I'm telling you I'm I'm maybe I'm even asking for your input here\nVery briefly again starting in two thousand ten rock Obama being done the destruction of the Democratic party as an electoral apparatus they lost twelve hundred seats between two thousand ten in two thousand sixteen\nThey continue to lose seats in the two thousand sixteen race which Trump one which they thought was a walk landslide win for them\nThe last elections that approach what's coming up where the two thousand fourteen midterms Obama won\nWell even when he was on the ballot or the the um the midterms in in that year\nWe're not the grand sweep for Obama that they were ... they were said to be Obama presided over the systematic loss of seats by the Democratic party in two thousand sixteen comes along and Trump wins the presidency\nAnd the Democrats have the least amount of electoral power in Washington since the Nineteen twenties\nAnd from that we're supposed to believe that Donald Trump alone\nHas provided the energy and the imposition of ... and the Democrats\nTo comeback show up and re take everything they lost all the problem with that is the Democrats lost because Republicans won the Republican voters showed up in droves in every one of those mid terms and the presidential race two thousand twelve in two thousand twelve presidential race\nDemocrats continue to lose seats even though Obama won his reelection nobody else Democratic Party\nThat much worse bragging about some of the Republicans\nCame alive first it was the Tea Party Obamacare and all of the standing to\nEnergize but then it was Lois Lerner the IRS and all the other scandals that came along Benghazi there was nothing was Obama was doing the economy was a flat line if it wasn't if it wasn't deteriorating there wasn't anything Obama was giving away nuclear weapons to the Iranians\nHe was giving away guns the Mexican drug cartels in a back door way\nTo do damage to the second amendment people want to know part of what Obama was doing every chance they had to vote against it they did except they didn't have the guts to vote against them because of the racial component development twelfth now we're supposed to believe\nThat that trend that sees the Democrats holding the fewest number of electoral seats they've ever had since two thousand to the Nineteen twenties has suddenly overwhelmingly changed simply because there's so much hatred for Donald Trump\nAnd a hatred for who Trump is hatred for his tweets\nWe changed simply because there's so much hatred for Donald Trump\nAnd a hatred for who Trump visits hatred for his tweets it's hatred for his personality it's hatred for his manners or lack there of hatred for the way he behaved it's hatred for each hairstyle each hatred because it'll be mean spirited what that\nAnd that alone is what the media and Nate Silver telling us Oscars this massive Democrat blue wave\nThere is no trend that suggests Democrat blue wave plus traumas uniting\nThe Republican Party has one more Nate Silver life here from the same pod cast continued now listen\nWe're in this weird zone we're number one I remember we ever had a split in the forecast like this I mean pretty unusual to predict the likelihood of a split is unusual were also I always says when we're in the eighty twenty zone and we're now in the eighty twenty zone\nIn both places that makes me nervous and remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means that like there's a forty percent chance that one of those two predictions will be wrong so you know not quite fifty fifty but we call something a toss up it's forty percent or greater almost a toss up that you'll have one of these forecasts\nAnd I might just for you let me translate this\nThis guy is nervous as you can be he's sweating bullets there is a fifty fifty chance that he's wrong he's admitting he's never seen the splits like this he's talking about Democrats winning the house Republicans winning the Senate he is never seen anything like that either of I don't know how to do this\nAnd we consider it a toss up if it's forty percent one way or the other but I guess he's kind of like if he hasn't the slightest idea what's going to happen this election and he's very nervous over the fact that he can't figure out he can analyze he doesn't have the slightest idea what's\nGoing to happen here now he didn't want to come out and say it that way you need to have the talent and the expertise to experience that I have to translate these clowns when they start throwing their numbers around\nAnd their percentages and stuff but let me just go through this very quickly well you know we're in this weird zone where I don't remember we ever had a splitting the forecast like there's pretty good news a lot of things wrong usual this time aren't they need to be unusual since two thousand sixteen hasn't it\nTo predict this likelihood of a split is unusual we um you know I always say uh when we're in the eighties twenties zone and we're now in the eighty twenties on in both places that makes me nervous meaning eighty twenty Republicans keep the Senate eighty twenty Democrats when the house\nAnd makes me nervous eighty twenty that's as close to a lot of it makes me nervous we're now in the eighty twenties on on both sides of this remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate really\nThere's no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means it like there is a forty percent chance that one of those two British is going to be wrong well there is a pretty good indication that Democrats are not going to win the Senate\nHe's saying its impact we don't win the Senate ah when the how he doesn't know he's nervous his\nAnalysts telling you if it's eighty twenty both sides but they don't know it's fifty fifty fifty fifty you might not even show up and go to work folks if all all of your analysis and all of your data collection produces it could go either way it why is anybody paying you\nRush Limbaugh going the way home to eat I met for\nThe big time on
