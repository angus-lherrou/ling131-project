I got to tell you the Denisovans not just having property it's where it is a in this course the Palestinians and the Israelis are truly one where they are because it's the holy land that's it's where\nJesus and everything else began for them and they don't want to move to Kansas City or Iowa or Nebraska or anything like that we've got the land available there's no doubt about that but it's not just about land a part of the issue is fighting the holy land itself Sam I Want you to take that question\nUm there's land but if not their land and I'm I'm\nI I think trying to federal um where people go at this point is a ... that's not going to happen or if it's way way too late or if I'm Wondering if\nYou should ever had um you know the the second burrito I'm forty years after you've had the fifteenth slice of pizza I I I think what's important to to understand about the Arab Israeli conflict\nIs that the experts the state department diplomats and everyone has been using a formula\nThat um you know it all the\nThe Israelis and the Palestinians can be ... and the girl she ate a case\nLike everyone else and they're missing what I Believe is a critical point and that is that the mathematical equation that they're working on is flawed the state of Israel was um was\nCreated the Israelis DNA dictates that the Jews never again be forced to um to do anything at the point of a gun I'm through force and the Palestinians DNA because of the\nPoint of a gun I'm through force and the Palestinians DNA because of the establishment of the state of Israel in Nineteen forty eight warrants demands that there'll be some sort of military victory some sort of um he will Jima moment of raising the flag where they\nCan say that their ... their opinion there equals if they've achieved they've achieved Harry\nAnd both both sides um in in how they approach the world and how they approach their very very small neighborhood\nUm our our ... ...

Israel and look at all the American blood been spilled over there over the decades and it just seems like nothing has changed but my question is uh which William Buckley this is the forgotten the history that nobody you know really remembers but\nIf he gave up secret in I don't know if you know begin or not was your any trickle down collateral damage to the field officer of the ... of the CIA that were out in the field or from the information that he might have given up\nAnd keep up the good work and I'll take my answer off the air you got to give you that question [noise] sure good question\nBrian uh answer your question is uh uh at the time or the agency the CIA um could not take any more chances meaning ah in essence they they removed all of this personnel assigned to the station\nOr got them out of a country a shop or they had to shut down or their source network a and\nAnticipate the entire ... chain that that had been compromised there\nOr they had to shut down safe houses are where are you meet with informants are in anticipation that perhaps bill or had disclosed that uh so uh you have that trickle down effect and there's also a damage assessment that comes into play here to\nWhere you start thinking about um you know the intelligence services exist to steal secrets and so here you have a uh the CIA the CIA point man in Lebanon\nThat have access to everything or what value is that to another intelligence service so if you're the ... intelligence service for example\nA Kenyan horse trader swap with a let's say a B Russian KGB at the time [noise] so those are the kinds of things that you have to anticipate and you look at it from a worst case scenario\nAnd you shut down everything so ah was ah operations compromise or a operations were are certainly shut down stopped a until a complete damage assessment is done to see how bad things are\nAnd then you have to restart a your entire um human collection network or which is never easy\nSham what's happening to Lebanon today what's the situation there\nUh well I'm Hezbollah is perhaps the most powerful political party in the country while\nI'm Hezbollah has um stockpiled hundreds of

in Argentina in Columbia Venezuela I'm In a previous work that I did um ... we learned that um\nThe the government of president mature in Venezuela um had a um a a shuttle service on the Venezuelan UM

um Europe in the middle east um\nMoney the money from those cells were laundered\nGum in West Africa um some of the money was smuggled as a result of stolen car rings in the United states [noise] um it is a global criminal enterprise\nUnbelievable I I've always felt we should just legalize all drugs set up to somebody you know clinics to help people but\nLegalized drugs don't put people in jail

a\nLot of people do see them why do you think people ... or so fascinated with the unusual in the paranormal hands you show my show I mean people love this stuff they can't get enough of that how

don't ... that was the kind of a book came from the haunted universe that maybe maybe we live in the universe where everything goes wrong and the other universes that are supposed to be like as

up\nAnd you realize well this was just a natural occurrence or or\nYou know some kind of electrical discharge and the clouds or whatever it was\nIt gets to be disappointing doesn't it\nShould because then you know once you get it it it makes the St Louis of life young seem ordinary in a way you know that that\nBut they can't be an explanation for everything that's the way I look at it you know that there are these things that happen out there and you certainly a big pot of all kinds of different just strange things\nPeople see things and you know they can't be making up they can't be hoaxes\nOr we have instead of the book where you know hundreds of people out of the people of different kind of paranormal type stuff [noise] so it has to be something behind it maybe it's all tied in

talk about it a lot [noise]\nUm but it's it's an endless fascination with us with a lot of people\nWell and you write about this important aspect not all these people are making things up or lying or mistaken in even if you have a hundred people\nIn Ninety nine of them are making up the stories that they see ghosts and your clothes and big foot you've got that one person who's not lying who has seen something very under usual and that that's what fuels me that's why I continue looking for these answers\nBecause that that one person is the reason that I go after these stories\nAll it takes is one ghost story to be true and they might as well be true\nI tell Linda molten how who's a reporter Mac or she's an expert in crops formations and a truly believes that most of the crop formations are made from other sources other than men\nAnd whatever those sources could be could be UFOs could be the earth doing it as a vehicle to communicate with us whatever it is she thinks most of them are done that way and I told her I says Linda\nIt doesn't matter because even if all of them except one is the unusual one it's amazing story it's it's the story of the lifetime\nAnd hopefully for sure and I like a ghost story you know if you could talk if there's one person was come back here from the afterlife sets it was amazing thing that's ever happened ever\nWere you in the you were in the

thought it was it was interesting to watch ... who is a pitcher for the Dodgers and their doctors are not used to play in conditions like that or he was out doing his that warm up with a sleeve shirt on and shortly after that he tried out of the old weather yeah yeah yeah\nIt was not a pleasant it was really not but you know what else I saw that was really kind of nice not that it is more typical in baseball and is any other sport but\nThe players all seem to know each other and they all seem to like each other like the guy who stole second base or wrenches ankle against the red Sox play can remember his name as soon as he it up what's it what is it\nI Can't remember his name but he designated hitter\nYeah he got the guy who was on second base helped him up and then they started talking to each other about what's what and then you watch that's what I look for when I look at the game who's talking to him and all of these players for both teams as they got around\nA we're all talking to each other and it's not that kind of and maybe the tone is set by the fact that the coaches are as friendly as they are so they wish\nAnd it's not like Yankees Red Sox 'cause that's all yeah that'd be all really angry at least I Am not Haiti yet or in fact I hardly ever get to play each other which right it makes it different but I was there should be able to the red Sox\nYeah and I feel like they're both having fun and yeah the red Sox have had this dream season it's fun to watch and those are the teams that are there deserve to be there they've worked hard the Dodgers were in third place in September yes they do act that they were able to get there again it's a thing\nI think the red Sox had amazing here\nThey have won a hundred and three of a hundred and sixty two games I Believe the Dodgers one hundred\nIs that right or nine like Ninety Ninety nine like that yeah well\nGood luck to them both seriously I we talk about by the red Sox but I think what I saw last night made me feel good because it was away from the anger and the silly stuff that goes on even in everyday life what a great lesson sports often\nDepending on the sport teachers is really good lessons about life\nI think that and if they don't the players they have the opportunity to do that and I think the last night's game anyway it was a very good sort of a thumbs up in terms of uh playing a good game and having some fun after all I don't watch many games a matter of fact [laughter]\nI was looking at one of the shots and I I recognize somebody who was sitting behind home plate a it was really you know

want to think that it had\nSomething to do with a formation of the government of Israel and I don't remember I I was a fairly good student of\nThe un and our forgotten but is this something connected here\nOr as to the the actual determination of this a naming the name of the United nations day Nineteen Seventy one U.N General assembly recommended that any country that makes up the UN should recognize it as a public holiday\nToday marks the Seventy second the United nations day which you and leaders say is meant to highlight the gravy importance\nOf sustainable development no you know
