point is you've already said they were willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo what's interesting is told us is this is just sat in thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people's daily\nA dollar allowance or will somehow going to a massively improve their lives they're doing all white with out is just lost the will ridge a lot of them are\nAre counting illegally into this country because they had been tricked and deceived into thinking they're going to get a better quality of life and they had down there because you were to happen a lot more money in their pockets but that I didn't\nI didn't want to suggest that we solve that problem by giving them money I don't think that's the right way I think the way is to uh\nIs to ah help or teach 'em to use free markets and the property rights and um a lot of other sorts of things that would help those economies to grow and you know the good news is that\nA those are those are people are growing a we have about a about a I think it's about six hundred million people now that are under nourished across the world\nUh uh that's uh that's about a little less than ten percent of the world's population used to be thirty percent of Thirty years ago [noise]\nSo are people are are getting more nourishment uh they're getting more food famine has been basically eliminated\nUm it used to be that every decade twenty million people across the world would die from famine that was in the early Nineteen hundreds now every decade it's less than a million people died so we are making a lot of progress but I didn't want to suggest that we just ship them money [laughter] uh you're right on that\nLet's go to another caller barbers in

Oklahoma has more earthquakes in way dealing California from oil drilling fracking primarily and when he was\nActually that is true they are having more earthquakes but it isn't really fracking it is the it's the injection of the wastewater from fracking that is causing those are like\nWell that's what they mean by the ... yeah well you're right indirectly it is\nBut uh they're working other other places where we can inject water all all day it's that's a really a problem to be solved by geologist or they need to tell us where we can safely inject water where we can't and then uh and then will reduce the possibility of quakes\nSure possibility Steve that this entire planets should just have some horrendous catastrophe that something could happen just shattered the planet to\nAbsolutely it could you know\nThis catastrophe that something could happen just shattered the planet to\nAbsolutely it could you know I I Hope that never happens and\nAnd you know all we can do though with with the things is adapt that's what we\nThat's what we do with the storms that's we do with the sea level rise we've been doing that for a thousands of years uh there's really no evidence that we can control the climate we can do something locally with temperatures\nAnd locally but what with weather but not on a global scale I'm very unlikely that we can control the climate at this point\nHow to British Columbia Canada we go to the first time caller Terri Hi Terry thanks for calling\nFellow man that's a good night to be having this discussion I most appreciate it\nA George ... knowledge first than if the current age is the information age use or are the cutting edge and you'd have my total respect thank you Mr Gura them I say I am the Lone Ranger [laughter]\nI have lost most of my credibility killer researcher but\nPeople think I'm Crazy or heated and bringing up these these arguments that you do it means nothing and there's [laughter]\nIt it it's a boom warming is a very sexy position because people feel smart and that if I just you know said my balls or do whatever I'll save the planet and [laughter]\nI'm sure you've heard it before but a big thing that I Love to bring up in this totally discredited like lister going to address this or the Ninety thousand to cargo ships at sea they're pumping [noise] [noise] [noise] over to the air\nThat must have a profound effect on 'em\nWell there is there there is an issue right now I'm cargo ships use fairly high sulfur fuel fairly furry dirty fuel\nUm and I think the uh I Can't remember which organization is but the but the international organization on shipping\nHas actually agreed to go move to some different a lower so for fuel types and a lot of folks and the industry think that it's going to be a problem it's probably a good step though so I'm generally in favor of moving to lower so for fuel overtime\nUm there's a lot of people also talking about cutting greenhouse gases from ships though it primarily carbon dioxide I think that probably is not such a good idea\nBut that is one of those real real pollution problems we need to clean up we also need to do a little or improve uh the\nProblem with the litter of plastic and the oceans that's another issue\nThat we need to work and then working as a nation was the international maritime organization\nThank you that's [laughter] that's it they're predicting that the the increase is going to be huge uh in the next several years by twenty fifty you've no action is taken it'll increase by up to two hundred and fifty percent that's a big jump the sulfur yeah [noise]\nUh possibly so yeah I I couldn't really comment on that but I think so I think that's probably a good step\nLet's go to Bruce in Portland, Oregon Hi Ruth go ahead\n[noise] [noise] Hi how you and your and thank you for telling my blank spaces that I have no control over their hands [laughter] okay now I'm very I'm\nBack in ... I think it will be out of here or I'm right now and if they give it some kind of a of a plan\nThat they can make our world more free uh I like my aunt paying it forward now putting our technology here in in a place where we can\nBring our energy you where it can be three for everybody that would be great and I think they can do it\nAnd that might be here that\nYou are here donate you making our our uh\nDams in uh eagle do better and I've done that we're looking at it even even rural people out here like ... and ... is bigger than I can pay it forward right now I think that we often lead free I mean without\nAnything that would be great but Steven they're going to want to make money on this some aren't saying\nI mean one of the great points that I talk about in the uh the second chapter of outside the green boxes the rise of democracy or the United states basically was the first modern democracy now we have\nUh just about I think it's almost Ninety nations set of ... that have a form of democratic government so it's gone from zero to Ninety nations\nAnd with that you know we get the benefits of legal equality and freedom of speech religion rule of law lemonade show slavery\nWomen's suffrage personal property rights a lot of other things so the world is getting freer oh that's a very positive thing and it's all part of this idea that everybody is better off there's a lot of people going around saying the world's going to collapse overpopulation we've got pollution we've got all these terrible things\nBut people are healthier lives and and one aspect of that is the rise of democracy\nSee what do we do with people's cars this to me is one of the most heartbreaking situations people who cannot afford electricity or their gas uh let's see the dead of winter and it's going to get shut off because they can't afford it\nWhat do we do with those kinds of folks I mean it's it's sad\nYeah that's a tough situation actually the United states is in better shape than many European places because\nUh we have very low cost electricity um a crisis here in the United states I often put up a graph comparing Europe almost all the ... the nations in Europe to hire a electricity prices and we have here in the United states we have the lowest cost natural gas in the world\nRight now where the biggest petroleum pull the producer\nSo should we said though that nobody nobody gets shut off during implement weather or can we say that\nI Am not going to get into that I Do think many of the the uh the utilities have that sort of policy that\nThey're either not allowed to do that by law they have a policy where they're not going to do that during implement weather and they tend to postpone things in the summer I think\nFree information you need a call now one eight

an eye on\nWhat seems to be the question that most people want answered\nWell um there are many um\n[noise] you know I speak a lot to businesses and one of the things I run across as they they tell me you're preaching to the\nChoir [laughter] you know\nBut the funny thing is though they don't realize that the majority of us business thinks that the climate laws on the energy laws are foolish in many ways\nThe headlines or grab by a lot of the big companies like apple and Google and uh the political leaders but but the kind of the rank and file of of American business um thinks a little bit different but they don't realize that they're in the majority are so it's a little bit of a strange situation\nUm\n[noise] let's see what are some of the other major questions why why are all the climate models wrong is some is uh something that people come up with and that has to do with some of the assumptions um\nAre they concerned about anything\n[noise] [noise] well they you know back in Nineteen Ninety the United nations and the inter governmental panel on climate change predicted that a temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade or with a mix of five tense and the low of two tenths and if you put those on the chart\nThose rice pretty fast but over the last Thirty years we we fed much less than that so we're we're below the estimates of the United nations that they made in Nineteen Ninety we're not seeing the\nThe rice that was forecasted which basically says the assumptions of the climate models are wrong and natural factors dominate global temperatures\nLet's go to Joe in Long Island New York east of the Rockies Joe go ahead\nSteven thrusting show uh actually I Want climate change I wanted to be warmer but a lot of\nQuestions or add a comment a got a quick uh my first question what they are we just had a factor in Indonesia unfortunately and they said that they weren't really warned that that was supposed to be a week and that was working with a papal cut of\nJohn and all of this thing so I I relate this to a\nOcean temperatures how well monitored all ocean temperatures and the satellites come into play with anything to do with that a second question would be\nA political climate you know ... boy talk about the last couple of weeks twenty four seven as the uh you know Brett Kavanaugh are in his shoes and a and a\n... you know it does make me think that the senators\nDon't have time to study science never or the and trust and really don't have a good grasp of science maybe they took one costs thirty forty fifty years ago and science and never really updated themselves on their own\nUh and uh you know I don't want to pick on trial is already gotten blamed for the recent hurricane or in the Washington Post and ah that my comment would be uh you said the nuclear ... or a industry uh was traditional\nAnd I think it's a like a lot of people a potential disaster waiting to happen and I know it doesn't contribute to climate a big ... CEO too if you look at shutting all ball\nThat's still only buried it's still active it's another bank contained nobody can go within fifty miles from the place all these years later\nSo ah it take New York for example you got to the point right now I'm a this big metro area or something of a happened what that then what happens in New York City\nSo you've got a whole bunch of things that are I think there were three of 'em one was what are we doing with ocean temperature measurements the uh the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has I think they're the ones who put out these diving\nUm a measuring devices I forget the name of them again but they have thousands of 'em out there now but\nUh they've only been deployed for about a twelve to Fifteen Years so we really only have data on ocean temperatures are from measurements are over the last twelve to Fifteen Years before that it was just you know people take 'em and ships and kind of measurements are going around and those were very accurate\nThe um\nThe thing you said about uh what's um let's see ... the third one was the nuclear plants I think one of the big issues with nuclear plants that they need to solve if they need to be able to shut down automatically we still have plants and most of the ones around the world that are relying on cooling systems\nThat they need need to solve is they need to be able to shut down automatically we still have plants and most of the ones that are on the world that are relying on cooling systems and if the cooling systems fail fail\nLike happened with the Saddam in Japan than we have a chance for a big melt down so that problem needs to be solved um the other big problem with nuclear is is just frankly natural gas is so darn cheap right now nobody will build a nuclear plant and I think the third one was\nUm satellites well you said something about governments and what's your question yeah I'm\nJust saying I I think you know him and I read or undefeated about five times in the U.S Congress\nI think the majority of ah arguably more than half of the United states so members of Congress right now do not think global warming is a dangerous problem out most of those around the Republican side of course\nAnd as we mentioned we have we have we now have a climate revolts if you will in Australia and Ontario so I think I think political leaders are starting to get it uh this has been a disaster crisis for more than Twenty years now and we're really not seeing the disaster so I'm hopefully I've covered most of your issues\nI think the biggest problem we got as an ex clear from the sun that could wipe out our power grid in render is useless wherever that\nThat's possible probably a big explosion there again if the if all those ... go off in Antarctica and Milt of big bunch of ... south of the of the peninsula down there that could be an issue this many many things that could occur\nUm again we need to adapt as well we can and the biggest one is an ice age boy I liked this warm weather folks I Do not want to see the start of the studies that\nWe've got we've got against Robert Felix who believes were in the early stage of an ice age\nBirthday who knows Walter in Pennsylvania is taken away well go ahead\nBy Georgia needless to say I did talk to you once again George\nThank you\nSure you're out with all due respect Mr Gore on sounds a lot like a doctor Tim ball ...

I think some people misunderstand that\nI did a little disclaimer inside the cover\nAnd it was kind of a play on words but uh basically what I said was in his marches big foot has not been deemed real these works or work or fiction\nAnd the point I was trying to make was in the eyes of the world everything about big foot is fiction for the most part what do you go before\nSay the ... film or to date after the Patty film or most of the world looks at these things with a wink and a nod I mean when I have conversations with people about a big foot when I have conversations with people about a UFOs\nYour typical conversation is that if somebody looking at you with a big grin on their face listening to what you have to say and then saying to you come on you don't really believe that\nThere was a guy who called the program years ago when our bill was still alive coal blog ... any claim that he shot\nToo big for ... and had them and of course\nI don't know what happened the guy you definitely don't know what happened to the reported ... what are those kinds of stories in your opinion authentic or made a\nWell you know [noise] what are we talking about George we're talking about one person it's like a he said she said\nRight I Believe me the proof [noise] yeah\nI Believe that these people have no ax to grind I heard that story a when a or did it and I'm\nThinking about it the man was not being paid who could have easily just shut up and walked away\nHe didn't he wasn't trying to sell anything you know [noise] ah he was reporting what had happened and the fact was\nHe like a lot of other people had a certain amount of guilt about it [noise]\nUh having seen it they really didn't know what to do with it they knew there was going to possibly be some repercussions and so they buried them a I've had a couple of encounters\nA where animals have been killed was said to have been killed one of them are was in self defense\nAnd uh this man felt this thing was going to kill him a and\nWhat do you have to say about that am I to say you know you all wrong for doing that you should have you shouldn't have done that you shouldn't have pulled the trigger I mean I can only I Can't imagine\nThere and that's a difference than just going out into the wild to look for one to shoot it\nWell that's that's correct you know if you'd like I could um well I don't know let me let you continue I have so many things Erica\nShow we will do them in we've got a break coming up in a couple of minutes sure the ...\nUh like I said I have some people are who have seen bodies a couple of guys say they shot them and as far as bugs are concerned I thought he knew his firearms I thought he knew\nHis uh bullets\nUh it didn't seem they seem very real to me and there's a lot of people uh down south uh ended his neck of the woods\nThat do go out on these night haunts ah I have a couple of uh accounts with guys were out hog hunting feral hogs\nAre which is becoming a big problem down\nSo huge and through\nAnd are there are people actually being hired out now by a former and landowners or because they're in fear of their children are getting attacked by these boards and whatnot\nThat hiring people to go on their property they go out at night they have lights they're riding around some of them have electric basically golf carts so they could ride around rather a ... and they're you know trying to gain an upper hand on some of these I personally I think there shoveling against the tide\nBut um [noise] people feel like they have a need to try to take some of these animals down a thankfully as they're doing it to me there's going to you know food kitchens and whatnot but it's a it's a real problem\nI had to call year ago\nFrom an individual who was fishing and he caught two trials and he said as soon as he kind of realize what was going on he saw a big flood looking at him about eight feet away\nAnd he said he's holding the two trials the guy is ... and the big flood\nLooks at him and he went oh my God what am I going to do so in a panic he handed the to travel to the big foot in the big foot took them looked at them and gave one day now does that sound real to you or do you think the guy cold and made it\nWell I'll be honest with you a that is most one of the most unreal stories\n[laughter] or if I heard that I Would have discounted a entirely however having said that I had a gentleman that was canoeing in Vermont\nAnd ah he had taken a lake in to a creek\nLet's hold on to that story will you were going to take a break we'll come back and talk about that I've always had suspects about that fishing story but let's get yours and come back\nArizona State university offered over one hundred and fifty how remain degree programs when you present on line you learn the same degree and she went on can't ask them wherever you are on your schedule plus the one line exceptionally transfer credits for information tax base hit the reset the nine one three\nLearned for yourself fly here was ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report on learn to drive with Arizona State university for more information about on the one line hooks me three seven nine one three that's off the AC eating three seven nine when three\nPosted in Ninety seven point one the the more stimulating talk coast to coast Ninety seven point one the the more stimulating talk\nAmongst them back to coast to coast here was William she's the author of the big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe and a break on\nYes yes oh well this gentleman was a canoeing in a creek are up in Vermont and really he was poured urging stomping when he came across some nice holes that he felt he could get some good trout and\nAnd ah he was lining up some trout on Iraq near him as he was catching them he was camping on the side of the creek and his plan of course being the cook 'em up\nFor dinner so he had caught a few brook trout late I'm On a rock and\nWhen he turned over Detroit will gone now his first instinct was the raccoons took more raccoons took them and I've actually had this happened to me fishing that connect quite river\nOr wherever I heard a little Russell in the bushes and I turned my head and a rainbow ahead laying up on the side of the river [noise] ah I see a raccoon\nStick it\nLeft and right grabbed it and went back into the grass so I Know this happens and that's what he thought\nSo a little later on he was putting more fish up there when he saw a long arm extend out at all most ground level\nAnd the huge hand grasp the pile of fish and not just one fish in one school grabbed numerous fish and retracted back into the weeds\nAnd that when he saw that it was game over because he knew this was something in the woods said he hadn't bargain poor and the problem was that\nWhere it had reached out at ground level his tank would shut up about fifty feet away from them so shortly thereafter that he\nGot the guts to go over there and repack up his tent and started to make its way out with the canoe but he had said that\nHe thought it was a big ... obviously what else has a long hair rearming began burning stand together the bushes and then he also realize that this thing had to have been crawling on its belly\nIn other words will be sneaking along kind of like a soldier trying to sneak up\nAnd ... and was\nAble to know that he was pushing short him fishing sure when he was doing by placing these fish on the rock and then had positioned itself\nOr in such a way where we could\nGet up there to get the fish and retreat back into the woods without being seen but according to him when he saw the first group of British missing he was actually sitting on a rock smoking is pipe\nAnd he had his peripheral vision looking out towards the rock now now being mindful he wanted to catch the raccoons and the act [laughter] what he caught was not a raccoon at all\nAnd uh he was pretty ... pretty frightened off by that\nAnd and tell us with these reports hotter people describes the creature in terms of tight neuro big how big\nYeah well it it really varies I Would say a minimum you're talking a seven feet tall a\nAnd I had a ... point he had\nA lot of people say the comical shape Ted is varieties of a a hair for coloration ranging from like salt and pepper\nTo a a lot of people use the term or burned or read [noise] uh and then of course brown and black sort of seems to be a variety and then we have two different basically physique\nUh it seems that you either have these kind of almost cylinder ... very early [noise]\nA beer like for lack of a better term and then there's the other one that appears again and again and it's described as being like a weightlifter or a ... you know Arnold Schwarzenegger or to the tenth\nAnd again and it's described as being like a weightlifter or was this you know Arnold Schwarzenegger or to the tents degree type of body extremely muscular\nOr the chest you know Bolger Utah is you know just like a a real monster\nSo these are things that people are seeing and then it just varies a I had one I'm a one story called the tree stand a incident I named it\nWith this fellow claimed that his trees stand who's twenty five feet in the tree which put his feet at something like twenty feet and this sasquatch and a group above the sasquatch is\nIt seemed that the group was distracting him making our own noises in the woods while he was bow hunting and he couldn't see because of the density of the trees and the fog that was laying in this valley in the early morning\nBut he had said he recognized as a hunter that these our noises one not real in other words they were being mimicked\nAnd that he was kind of paying attention to this and sorting out the pieces a sasquatch snuck up on him from the rear and jet Li grabbed the heel of his blue [laughter]\nThink about how big this thing had to be even if he was wrong and his measurement nobody ... trees stand ten feet off the ground I mean he said twenty five feet so what if he was at twenty feet and his feet or ...\nI don't know Seventeen something had to have tremendous\nHeight and reach but the amazing thing about that story was the way he said that the creature gently grabbed his boots\nAnd he jumped to the point where he almost fell out of the stand and when you look down this thing was looking up at him\nAnd he commented how he almost thought that it just wanted him to know that they can do that that they could sneak up on him and grab this boom and then it left the scene and everything went quiet again\nYou know maybe you're born big food here in the woods tell us about the terror Porsche what what's going on out there\nWell I mean first of all when we talk about terra or when we used the word bizarre uh in regards to big foot\nI ... I take the stand as to what is more terrifying\nIs it ... is it not enough terrifying to see a ten foot tall monster walking across the shoulder road or is it more terrifying to have one linking you in the woods or when you're hiking with your girlfriend\nThese things are out there they're frightening people\nAre a lot of the encounters a somewhat casual wear this scene from afar and then the people exit hastily but then there's other ... encounters where it's my opinion these things don't want the people to be where they are\nAnd they seem to exhibit behavior that in my opinion they're chasing the people out\nThey want to monitor region and so they they\nDon't want them there and I think if you push the envelope a you're going to be in the sorry state of affairs or when you talk about this gentleman that said he had to fish and the the big foot walked over and he gave him to\nBe gay but one back [laughter] telling you right now George that big foot if I see that big foot\nI'm going to get we'll like pop on a on a Kansas [laughter] you know we're going to speed up the film real and my legs are going to be turning like the wheels on a car running out of the\nWilliam does anybody ever report Bebe big foot\nI have a I Do have an account oh this is very interesting another fisherman and here's the thing George I believe that\nAside from the accidental sightings which there are numerous ones the vast majority of these sightings of being hand by people who are out there doing things that your normal person when they say normal I don't mean like the abnormal normal but\nThey're doing things are involved in things that the average person does not do the hunters that fishermen there in remote areas or the loners they're people who are getting out and going into places for peace of mind to exercise whatever the case may be\nThe weekdays at eight Ninety seven point one the big talker\nSo when do you believe she will it's hard to say she loves adulation just
