I on the other good question because the the the legend is that our town is constantly flooded baptized by water every seven years and so it seems to be true\nNow I looked into this and I'm like going All right well when's the last time that we've actually had somebody tried to remove the curse\nAnd it was back in two thousand\nAnd what happened was in Nineteen Ninety nine we had a huge flood again and it wiped out our spa building and it was almost going to be demolished\nThe Murphy company came in and they spend up quite a lot of money to have this building completely Reagan got it because it had to get rid of all this stuff this and that was like three million dollars right there\nBut anyway just to make sure that their investment was not going to be flooded they actually asked five members of the Native American Indian canceled come here and do a healing right over the town and over the spot building\nAnd I actually read the article in the Colorado Springs does that and it said after they did the healing ritual in front of the spa building that five crows flew up into the air\nNot even being able to find true not north flew into the building and crashed I'm not kidding you you've got if you want to look it up it's easy to do looking\n[laughter] isn't that an omen\nI don't know but you know what in two thousand Thirteen it flooded again it didn't work\nNo right to it feels like an elementary maybe they shouldn't do there again yeah we do not [laughter] ... yeah I mean there are\nCertain things to be done for the history tours and things that are being done in these secret land mhm or hotels being built and so forth where's the this fine line there to honor and respect the lure of that particular lane\nYeah I I say thanks every day you know to the good lord to the spirits that be to the land that be and I give there's a legend about manatees springs that you're not allowed to leave annoys you ask for permission or less you're ready to leave you come here because you are supposed to learn a lesson you don't come here because it's a choice\nYou Mars summoned to this town\nAnd I know that sounds crazy but I have talked to so many people over the years and I always ask them I said so what brought you to manage to springs I'm always the same story it was the weirdest thing you know I never planned on moving here and my car ran out of gas\nUh-huh stories like that and when you hear so many of them you know this isn't a coincidence\n... interesting to look back to the idea of what to do if you are sensitive to these types of energy or maybe you have a ghost in your house or something that might be\nVisiting you what what do you suggest to people that maybe don't want you want to do\nYeah see I think that when someone dies now I I Want to ... make sure that I don't offend anybody is religious or spiritual beliefs this is these are just my feelings\nI think when someone dies for the first three days or so that maybe this ... that they stay here some people believe that some you know maybe you just hang around to see her funeral and then you leave if you're not have both\n[laughter] um other stay\nRight up but if there is the lingering energy in\nYour home get rid of it or move\n[laughter] it's usually own that particular place not\nSee eye earlier in the conversation I did say that my house has haunted that I live in now and that\nI Want to say but the ... that it is it used to be the pikes peak Bible college it has a very interesting history\nAnd anyhow the other day band that it is that the valley so than this time of year I actually heard choir and music in my house I've lived here for Fifteen Years have never heard that before when I ran into the dining room and then it it ceased\nI Know it was inside of my house I heard it my dogs hurt it they weren't ...\nIs going on I think that's a residual it's like a birth in time in a quantum physicist can explain it better than I can but I just think of it is like Brent toast you can still smell the burnt so [laughter] it's gone yeah\nI Lived in time make more sense where it could be a coming back into this dimension temporarily in a split second\nYes and see that doesn't have a consciousness the choir music that I heard did not have a consciousness\nWe mean by no means it was just like I heard it in the room like some it was a burping time does that make sense to have a conscious\nIt's yeah it's just music that I heard like they came through sometimes believe it or not I can hear the trains that used to run behind my house and Senate ran in over a hundred years yeah so yeah when I hear so I don't know other people do [laughter]\nYou have anybody around that you could ask a much\nMore in tune with the higher laws of nature as I say it delicately they can they can pick up on it to have children especially that's why I Love it when when little children come on my tour is because um I turn it down a little bit so I don't scare them so much but uh the kids have a great time because they haven't been taught not to the\nRight to back to where people feel that they're afraid of ghost you're saying that they're not usually wanting to stay they want to move on or they should move on it\nAnd move on I think it would be like you know when you're hungry you just know to eat\nHow do you help but uh being do that you know would you suggest or how would you teach someone to us this this goes to move on\nWell you can always try talking to it I Swear it works but would you ask\nI tell it are you that you need to move on you know you're not supposed to be here anymore and I know this is your house and you love it that you are not supposed to be here anymore your loved ones that are waiting for you on the other side you need to go\nAnd just talk to them like a kind of person would talk to anyone who was scared and confused the beans are just like they were on earth and some of them get hot here it's it's really sad if you think about these ghost hundreds that go out and our teasing them like they're\nLike they're like in the zoo or something you know he's very nice\nLooking Ghostbusters where they could vacuum them up and put them into two yeah when you asked this where you say to this this entity that might be hanging around and causing this just move on ... ... why do people get scared\nI think that you know what those timing is addicting first of all it is so fascinating we both been fascinating with what's on the other side and then once you have validation I tell you what it does not stop it that it's like gambling or something it\nOpens up a whole new world of possibility and I can't\nBelieve this happened and then you do feel special because so many people want a validation that there is life after death let's be honest and when you do have it happen it\nBlows your mind and you will never forget it and you will never let anyone talk you out of what you saw the that's what happened to me when I was a child my parents told me that it was because they drop me on the head\nWhen I was a baby imagine that you know so I mean they all my life I was told that I was crazy and I'm not [laughter] because other people have had it\nHad just enthusiastic I Would say [laughter] but now ... which do you started this wonderful conventions paranormal mentioned travels to various areas tell us a little bit about\n[noise] well um we call it a moot movable fees like I said and so when we go into different areas the very very very first thing that we do is we contact with the local historians\nAnd the local goes hunting groups and we say we want to be your advocate we are here to help you and your community you need to get rid of an ego we're here we're not going to be like those guys so we're really like I Would call us paranormal psychologist [laughter]\n... yes\nAnd that's what we do and we're very kind and we're and we try to talk them over or do whatever we can write a book [laughter]\nThese so when you do the tours you have a group that comes with you and it's more of an active type of tour right\nMy two words it's because of the town itself is very active and this is how I Do my tour is um if you look at my website managed to lead since that time you will see that there's very little information on there\nAfter Seventeen years there's a reason for that I don't have a meeting sites because before my tours I actually do a prayer and a meditation on ask for the spirits which one wants to come out and talk tonight so the tours do change night by night and you never know which spirit is going to come out and play quite interesting\nYeah does that do say it was because if a date and time and all that you think are not as validating\nNo I didn't say that at all I'm just saying that's how I run my tours okay\nThere are always different they always change because that's how the paranormal is it's always changing it's always different\nThat there are some spirits that are pretty consistent but I called is much like fishing I mean as much as I Love to go fishing sometimes I don't catch it darn thing and that's how it goes hunting is you just

you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um it's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber\nWhy is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus factions it's like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um\nThe flow chambers exempt in this case you are not floating you're you're in this this controlled unit and all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like him he sank\nYou have headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them in their control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nAnd they don't feel a loner isolated right\nNo that's the idea you are isolated\nI mean they don't feel alone because you have headphones on and you know\nThey they're listening through headphones and exercise minor typically about fifty minutes long each one\n... and and people go on these incredible journey your friend who's been several times um went went into anything fictional county in\nThe minority someone into a data hate\nYes the idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the fate is of course\nAre ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself by Nora will be technologies been around for a long time that it helps us to go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then\nWhere do you go on the eastern where would you and I knew that pattern that you people silly it's kind of a ... right\nWell there's a yes or relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis um there's different progression setter used but it's basically a meditative type of program that's guided\nOften guided where you would just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experiences during even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have passed fly for Russians\nMhm they have contact with all kinds of let's just say a non physical being different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up\nTo our inner self people experience different kinds of ah let's just say I opening a mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body ...\nUh for instance past life or ... or regression type flashes are quite common and there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore your\nTrue self what did you get into\nA open up to that are waking to that multi dimensional shelf within you\nSee what tipped him questions could you ask yourself and then do you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise\nYou everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal and you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever ... whatever kind of information may have come to you\nOr imagery 'cause information can be transmitted many different ways it's not necessarily all the boy can be sure imagery\nOr through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open\nThe way that you receive information but uh people have all kinds of profound experiences and they are waking to\nTheir true self and they're the answers within um\nMhm yeah so the implication that personal grow into the spiritual awakening that are\nHappening in the can really be transformational and I like it because you guide your house to them and then in a way your experience you William how he died in in the direction that\nI Would have my own personal experience now my friend my friend has been a guest on the show before she said that she has in the past encountered\nSouls that need help and I think that's fascinating councils that\nSure um we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just mediate assistance or that's\nBut that will happen in um\nIn all the classes that can happen that comes up in my class as well or where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say to people that and there are people that have died but they are lost or\nFor instance someone that may have died um quickly and they were just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI think that that type of thing does happen quite a bit and I'm at\n... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses\nOn that type of guidance it's called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um [noise] and to that shift say assist them to go to a higher dimensional space\nMhm mhm so to assist him in crossing over have you ever done this after\nA [noise] a\nTragic incident and national tragic incident where NASA it's still really don't want\nI have because I I did a I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era and myself and I received a lot of contact\nAh during that period of time um that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way a marriage and you're having coffee one morning and your office and suddenly your entire body is gone ...\nI mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're shifting those are people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and it it's it's functions and different names and different cultures\nBut then I went to two we we presented in I think I'm more or let's just say are very grounded in a scientific waves at least the scientific as we can ... that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in\nA very logical way that's a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really allow the person to have their own

I mean these this is just real events that are happening the fascinating people all over the world\nI mean we're multi dimensional beans that's what we are and are biological body you know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very brief period of time\nAnd then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness and another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body exploration is that it's multi dimensional and that death is an illusion really I'm no no that's been said but\nOnce you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who have passed\nAnd you're doing is face to face this is life changing you no longer need a psychic to act as the intermediary you you you're empowered to\nDiscover the answers for yourself\nAnd it's really to find out what kind of journey are we all on because this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know what I shared this with you but I just interviewed Raymond Moody on my show and you know the ... the grandfather and clean the term a life after death\nAnd um he had\nExpressed to me after Fifteen Years doing that\nIs that\nHe doesn't know for sure that that yeah life have to get things just because scientists agree it's never really been proven even though he's heard thousands and thousands of poor people who live here in\nHis life to live the nomination he's killed a dozen as a scientist as a ... right now I Know for sure yes\nIs exactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need books study research will never give you that kind of verification\nYou can read a thousand books you could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic\nAnd it's not going to give you the inside and the verification you'll get from one out of body experience\nBecause suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour\nAnd that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards I mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\n... and to get away from this bickering and confusion

have terms that would be buzz words and knee jerk reaction causes to them and they ended up falling for it left\nHook line and sinker another reason why I left wing or is that doing this because they're worried that the disciplines that they trust and believe in our being shattered by a bunch of absolute gobbledygook insanity\nAnd so they have prepared a series of hoax essays and papers and
