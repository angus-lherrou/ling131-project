they have to write down everything that happens and then he read later he doesn't really always remember what goes on attendance subconscious but he consciously doesn't really remember uh all the time what happened so they transcribe these fans so he started having these senses\nAnd in one of them he contacted Houdini some other about a year before this and then he starts having these than says and he starts getting the code now the Houdini messages actually in three part it's one word than a ...\nSo this and he starts getting the code now Houdini messages actually in three parts it's one word than a nine words that spell another word and then she it's a two way code\nBeth has five words in French that she says\nBack to him now does that make sense to you or everybody I talked to a Ninety nine percent of them only think of a one way code you have you're on the other side one word or something you're going to get it across and then they're going to know that you're there but\nHoudini was sharper than that who he said listen I'm over on the other side I Want to make sure she gets the code\nThat she's the one who gets\nRight I Want to make its shirts her so she has five words in French that she gets back that come back to him so this was an ingenious code really because it's take it's a ten\nIt's like Fifteen works well\nWhy why was hearing professor obsessed with either trying to come back spiritually forty even let everybody know what was going on\n[noise] well ah\nAs you know Harry had to be first\nAnd the person had to escape\nRight here with us Scott pollock just had to be first I don't know if you know that Harry was the first guy to fly an airplane and Australia\nShe was that's true so\nHe had to be first in a matter of fact he did a great movie called the grim game about that so uh and he did several movies he he was a really multi talented guy\nUm I think he would have been I think he would have had a movie um career you know mogul yeah it had he survived he invented what they call now the dailies\nUh in in the movie industry he invented that\nAnd it was rush cut his right\nYes so he was a you know awesome\nAnd all these different ways so he was going to be number one and if he had to come back from the grave to do it he was\nGoing to do was going to do it and do you think it was successful\nI I Know with successful I Know that the code and the message that he gave was exactly the same message that they that they had agreed upon\nYou didn't know that for a fact didn't comfort professor Bess his wife\nThe best was in tough shape should best was pretty depressed that ... you know her husband had died and bass was um she had developed some what I Would consider bad habits she spent money like crazy\nAnd she uh\nWhile he was alive and after a\nWhile he was alive and after he died and so\nIf you remember Nineteen twenty nine when the message came back ah\nAll hell broke loose the none of her magic friends really wanted to believe that in any way and then later in the year the stock market crashes and she loses not only all her friends she loses all her money\nShe was the stock market yeah so\nShe loses the majority of her friends the majority of her money and now she's got this bad habit of spending money like it grows on trees she just\nAnd I guess hearing left a nice little so\nYeah he left her a part of the uh they pay double a condemned lady or whatever for his ah\nInsurance insurance the insurance was twenty five thousand dollars\nWhich in Nineteen thirty six it's probably a lot of money though\nRight probably that's close to a million dollars um so\nThey doubled that because they said it was an accident because this guy punched him and so it was the insurance company that came up and said ah that can't happen you can get appendicitis from being punched\nSo they were proven wrong in court so she got fifty thousand so she was rolling and do know and then she they put it all in the market and she lost at all\nYou have heard of the curse to Houdini yes what is the curse\n[noise] now Houdini had a three part\nShow the first part of a show with magic\nThe second part was the ... you have scape he would do an escape\nThat was where the water or the Chinese water torture cell or the uh the milk can escape and then the last part towards the end of his career he would go after the spiritual less than he would have have this um confrontation with\nThem launched himself like confrontation right well at some point in time he would say I've had enough and he would get up during the third part you would go out to a\nPalm reader or somebody or a a that he considered fake and you would go in there and all the reporters and everybody to be following him and he go in there and find a couch or something and they pull out like an incandescent down that goes in the dark\nOr sometimes see I found it I got you you know and\nThen they're probably string or something like that right so\nAh and of course the the mediums would just what are what are you doing that I didn't have nothing to do with that\nWell they honestly didn't because I'm a magician and a magician always have what you call and out the way out\nYou work it into your magic trick if you have a magic trick you might have two or three different methods on how it works and that's something the healthy switch to the next one and you switch the next one\nAnd and it works so you're assured of success and so in his magic that's built in in his state of course I'm I guarantee you had two or three keys in there you know and if all that failed and he couldn't get the T that's would come out and kiss him and she'd have the appropriate key in her mouth\nOr just spit it into his mouth exactly how\nHe always had an out he always had a way out well it was exactly the same thing for the spiritual\nSpiritual is because he had an agent and she would go into the town and she would find some low hanging fruit you would\nFind some a medium that were obviously tricking people but some she couldn't find what they're doing and she couldn't catch them so she would pull out something from beneath her clothes and like stuff that end of the couch\nAnd so later who gaining he had a sure thing that he could come back and expose them even though they didn't know anything about it\nIt seems as though that somebody somewhere put the curse on it\nRight so\nHe did this with Marjorie ah he Marjorie was the uh the which from Boston\nTake unlimited EKG morning noon or night you can always know how your heart is doing\nCardio mobile put

R. E. F. the James Randi educational foundation had a million dollar one here which they never had to give out\nRight they never had to give it out but they I don't think they actually let anybody who could actually win participate\n[laughter] um\nWell they're all like you for that one\nYeah ah well they can they can deflect me all they want I don't think they played fair and they finally shut it down and it just giving them money whoever they want it interesting that they were taking in about one point five million dollars a year talking about a million dollar contest so they were coming out way ahead\nSo anyway the a\nScientific American as the same kind of thing going on so they're always going to Marjory fan says so they set this up with six of these and then he goes up but he doesn't send\n'em ... that's the agent that easily sent the head what he does he have a box kind of looks like a foreigner he built this box and he has um James Collins bill for him\nAnd he builds all of a Houdini props and it's it's designed so that only mean his head in our hands can stick out\nOh okay so she can't get anything so ... got to make sure that she can't produce any trickery [noise]\nThey are doing everything goes according to plan and they have what they call it felt box it's a little a bell inside of a box and if they push on the bell rang and they always put the\nOutside of the reach of meaner er and in this particular instance they put it between Houdini slack so there's no way anyone can get at it well in the first thing I\nUh and in this particular instance they put it between Houdini slack so there's no way anyone could get at it well in the first ... the bell rings so the second fancy brings in the box and he puts her in the box is going to stop it\nAnd they put ... and the second ... the bell rings\nNow he's\nSo now he's got a fixture and liberal we talked about before about there's always an out you have to he has to fix marching ... Marjorie because he's actually already written a book about her how he's you know exposed her yeah so he's got this book is going to put out so he has to expose her\nSo she comes in uh everybody gets around the fans\nAnd of course Marjorie have a spirit guide and his name is Walter when it's Marjorie brother so Walter\nShe goes into a trance and Walter comes out and just starts cussing and swearing and cursing at Houdini and he says why do you put this foul thing in here why are you doing this why did you do this I'm cursing you\n'cause this is this is this and this is this fear and saying this right\nThis is the spirit saying it through Marjorie and the spirit Walter puts a death curse because\nThe box is a ruler one of those of rulers pulls up into three pieces\nYup is one of those all kinds and it's in\nSide the box the only people that had access to the box was Houdini\nAnd a James calling\nHow soon ... was the curse a professor and then who do you ended up dying\nWell Kurt crush them and some people say that he said you'll die in a year that that's a you know people debate about that but he died in two years he was totally dead this big strong man died in two years after being cursed by Walter\nScare him\nWell actually Houdini used it in his advertising you can see their Houdini ads all over the place where Houdini advertise that he's under the curse of the spiritual\nAnd could die at any moment\nYeah and it's really helped him you know kind of in a way but then you get this concept of the self fulfilling prophecy right that they have prophesied that he's gonna die so later when Houdini gets\nSick maybe this is in the back of his mind and so he doesn't go to the doctor 'cause he\nDoes he doesn't want to prove them right he doesn't want to show that he's getting sick or that something's happened and that kind of my\nViewpoint of maybe what happened why he didn't go when he first started getting sick and Arthur forward what happened to him [noise] Arthur Ford Arthur forward toward the world after he gave this or did he live Houdini\nHe outlive all or she lived until ...

the actual\nGuys or it came out so organically and has become this huge news story that now people are starting to panic about it but I Believe\nThere any time besieged setting the table so why is Paul Ryan against it or is it just because he doesn't think the president is a riot against ending birthright citizenship or against the way the president's trying to get it done\nPaul Ryan's always been a little squishy on ... on immigration issues but he believes and this is it fair argument it's not like he's making something up or he's either acting out of line the argument is does the president have executive power\nTo change immigration laws and I can remember not that long ago when Republicans what absolutely bananas because President Obama used an executive order to create DACA\nAnd that was the program to keep children of immigrants in the country which is don't\nSort of an ally but not right and so Republicans said you don't have the right to do that so there needs to be a real look at at not necessarily whether you can write an executive order on this but when the legal challenges come to the wild so stand up all the way to the Supreme Court\nDoes the introduction of the legislation by Graham Senator Graham ah end to this is the vision is aimed at ending birthright citizenship does that fix the problem of Ryan's referring to and then put Trump in the cat bird seed\nLindsey Graham patented who I don't know Lindsey Graham to point out\nLike a whole new guy I Know I I I mean I hate to correlate it to the passing of John McCain but Lindsey Graham has been a whole different person I think and then\nAnd much more leadership or sort of ... much more allowed and definitely more supportive of this president so he said I'm introducing legislation because one of the ways that you can change the law is with congressional approval until Lindsey is going to try to make that happen now I don't know that he'll actually have a step forward with that because\nYou're still going to have a lot of gridlock no matter who controls the house in the Senate there is going to be it's not going to be a blowout for Republicans let's just say that [laughter]\nThough you're going to have to deal with probably even more Democrats in the house then you have now who are going to try to fight that so I don't know if it'll necessarily go anywhere but that's\nWhat I was on what grounds do you fight this kind of an outrage that's I don't even begin to understand how these people think how do you come up with an intelligent strategy or an intelligent

in taxes for ... well we don't know what they're going to grow up to ... so it'll be born in their own country and if they have something to offer we look at them when they should be able to come in not just willy nilly everybody give is is nuts weird ... some people are just it's crazy in this country\nSo that I'm just curious because you know a lot of people think that that's written into the constitution and so does that give us the ability to look at other parts of the constitution and interpret them differently\nAfter auto yeah I'm that's where the court is there\nSo does that give us the ability to look at other parts of the constitution and interpret them differently\nWell after auto yeah I'm that's what the court is there for is to interpret the constitution requires right they're saying in the United states or convention I mean you know I don't believe that I actually got on the constitution that I find I Do and they always then okay I'll just finished my sentence and then obviously you're right\nThere's always been a debate about what the meaning of jurisdiction is when it was originally written into the constitution by ah by the creators of the constitution so\nThat's that's what they're going to go after it's not about necessarily a constitutional amendment it's going to be about trying to figure out in tents and using example throughout history of how that intent was supposed to play out though who\nDoes the interpreting here just from the executive order and then it goes to the Supreme Court and the other side whether it stands up or not or didn't know frame court interpret it and then Trump can make his executive order they\nNeither one actually what would happen is if he does write an executive order the executive order would go into effect and then no doubt somebody on the other side would it take it to court and legally challenges much like a travel ban\nAnd so then it would be solved and it would go through the lower court and no doubt be probably pushed all the way up to the Supreme Court where the ultimate decision would be made about intent at the cops with it\nFell and effect I'm just curious about all of this as a fill in effect as it goes up to the Supreme Court if that happens or is that typically\nThe travel ban they like to travel that late jaws and\nTell their wedding right next to this isn't okay\nAll right so that means you know just be retroactive would they be like every baby ever that was born here would it be starting hard to re read that right yeah\nIt's hard to regular direct but it should be in place and with regard to the constitution just to sort of what I was saying not necessarily getting my legs and I just think there are a lot of things that would be reviewed it from time to time we have a lot of things that\n... that are viewed a female and you start doing that though the protections that we all love they go away so you got to be careful when you start making\nBut I think that there's too many uh infringed feelings on both sides are it's but it's hard to know the right thing to do is you're right about that\nHappy Halloween everybody how do you do a lot of which is created in broomsticks were ... in Oregon [noise]\nTo get into the Halloween spirits are they paddle six miles on boards along the ...
