recognized professional psychic\nExorcist teacher specializes in the clearing the individual homes businesses a psychic protection Jeffrey is also an expert on hunting and homes and businesses psychic ability good goals such as spirit died as well and we tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks jurors for having me back on your show the fifth time a in a big hello ... everybody around are you for planets\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring out ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that individual and the media have a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about all things supernatural\nA good and evil are also in tradition um it's harvest time and uh in the ... tradition of that that\nThere's a veil of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year uh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing is that I deal with happen all the time and um but\nThe media pays more attention to it this time of year and that's fine anytime we talk about it and get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and\nAlso on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever do you think demonic spirits and we'll get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of bean green about certain things do you think demonic spirits ... something to do with that\nDefinitely ah we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth and this is a huge target for demonic spirits\nAnd also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people\nThat have power\nAnd can change the world for good or for ill and uh I think that there's never been a time in our history\nWhere demons have a greater opportunity to strike at the common person and also people who are very influential and so they're around with more than ever\nI think so too so let's get your take Jeffrey ... is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful spirit it could be said that there was a counter heart of angels\nThat powerful they are not regular people who have died and just have a bad attitude and too negative things they've been around for a long time they're very involved and may have not\nEver lived in the physical realm or not have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect physical reality and also the minds\nOf individuals' a very easily and uh\nWe're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a from Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people it's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that\nAre under the attack of ah demonic spirits negative spirits and ah\nDemonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical round\nFrom the non physical route\nAnd actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a ah demonic spirit and the negatives are also demonic spirits are are much better\nEquipped to ah influence people\nOn a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can see them and tell a path ethically trans for information into our system or emotional systems make us angry at each other\nOther people at ourselves get us to do the things we would not normally do and we can see them we don't know that they're there\nSee that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many demonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as ego\nAnd your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirit it's also true that demonic spirits ah can change you know once they were\nNo positive spirits and their ego gotcha them and now that they're doing very very negative things and the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack\nAre so many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits and all spirits do not have forced boxes they communicate George ... ethically and we all communicate color ethically it's\nKind of like a river that travels underneath\nOur consciousness and they communicate on that level\nAnd they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in that's also very common and uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do\nViolence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people\nAre not all violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits but they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and saw a negative spirits people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative thing is when they were alive and continue to do negative things demonic spirits are very powerful and as an extra ... when I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of\nThem are more powerful than me that's right that's you know they could come and get you\n... they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect that when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes negative feelings negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking forward to a vet the attacks on me or hurt it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work seven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked or successfully a few times\nFor short duration and it's very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form at a moment's\nNotice can you see them I can you ... I was\nBorn with the ability to see spirit I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school and grade school I thought I saw spirits in the classroom some were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them with school work and some are looking at me\nLike how can you see me\nWhat are you doing I don't like this and these are the one I had to watch out for and they'd actually come and start walking towards me in the classroom when I was very uncomfortable\nAll right stay with us Jeffrey we're going to hit a break and we're gonna come back and talk more about these demonic spirits where do they come from what they want and the next hour we'll take phone calls all about the\n... the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for I'm bone in now enjoyed ... listen live we're on demand anywhere any time good acoustic ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nThere's some exciting news simply safest now valued at one billion dollars this company used to be just five guys working together\nNow they protect more than two million people simply safe system is easy to use incredibly intuitive and takes just minutes to set up their no contracts are hidden fees and twenty four seven monitoring\nIs only fourteen Ninety nine a month to visit simply say ... dot com the order you simply safe system now that you'll get free shipping and free returns that simply safe no re dot com simply said Laurie dot com\nHe needs to be on stage beauty bass\nSetting I have a nine ... every day on your favorite type not content to make a fifty dollar Omar media Franklin protests and you get a free make up the tree out and then I think I never mind the you can help at the park and breast cancer research happening and making an inside any than states little things mean everything\nStage I couldn't get by\nMargaret hoping to when we try to come up all that stuff so I had I lodged top condition they'll say look killer\nFucking shot up who stopped talking kind of war it was just incredible feeling so she'll be full of just pins and needles round my heart when I have the extra auditor and two and a half months later\nSomething amazing happened which ... ... ... ... how to actually have contracted a staggering it that this was the thing that you can check the box office but I can kind of war that sweet ... results coming ...\n... ... excuse the pun ...\nNetworks beautifully owner Richard astro here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system who says he'll this gentleman's heart perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies fiercest powers to he'll visit C.

... we can just Ninety Ninety seven boys one of the documentary\n... with us as we talk about demons we'll take calls next hour as well before we get in the open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a natural human humans they\nWant nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so are they attack\nChildren and their cribs the ... attack people at work the attack everybody we all have targets on our back and we need to realize that\nUh we can't see them but they can see us degenerate negative emotional energies they generate hatred\nAnd they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today in order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand\nWhat they're trying to do they don't want us to know that they're they're they\nWant us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that in Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but the reality is is that they are around the spirits are around us all the time\nWe just can't see them and they communicate with us tell a path to either end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy your business\nAnd you destroy a person's ability to make money destroyed their family\nDestroy their lives\nAnd also ... to change or the way we think about each other right now they have us at each other's throats right wherever they want us\nTo do and\nWe have to stop it and there's there's ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWho do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story\nEverybody I've talked to has some kind of story of uh being in a home apartment condo a party a bar in a pub any ... any place\nWhere they've seen or felt something strange or picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can\nInfluence this by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying our feelings\nSo it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said\nThat I Would not normally do that and so when we're angry that's when they attack important\nPeople making decisions around our world they work on them or they don't\nKnow that there are there and they may not leaving them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not\nMost spirits are good summer not\nAnd so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue\nTo hang around our world and you just do things he would not normally do demonic spirits are\nJust experts at it they have weapons they have devices that they make a lot of non physical energy is just like spirits do spirits change their forms\nLike our our parents die as an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating and thinking about generating a form of what they want it to look like and also generating close because most people do not see\nMaking spirits so all these things are generated on a non physical level emotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well so demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred and rage\nWe think it's our own but it's not always\nAre wrong or the under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nI'm not sure if there's one particular\nSpirit in charge of all negative spirits I the the minor spirits are kind of like criminals they really don't even get along with each other\nThey don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always rural or they do work in groups I have found that to be true in all the decades I've been doing this\nUh but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time working on individuals and families getting them to fight\nUh getting people to fight with each other and getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify what would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage\nAnd very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them\nIs incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally\nUh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light will come out on attack I pull out my nonsensical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on\nBut everybody is not so fortunate that they can see them and know that they're coming\nAnd so there are around us and we don't know it around just working at home also negative spirit you know and negative spirits can work for them essentially\nAnd and sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not are also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die\nAll the time and lots of them are not good uh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so essentially the entire human race right now is under attack by\nNegative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier may not have ever lived in the physical around\nOr for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred and rage and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the ...\nYou get us to react to they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially kill a child in the cradle have no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought\nIt was horrible and they have they just have humans and so they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves and then our\nYeah for that show we dated for a Ninety seven one big talker\nYou see this show is a little ... the weekdays at age take more calls than anyone else and talk radio
