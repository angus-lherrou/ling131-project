fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet\nI'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a um I'm gonna get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina very welcome back to coast\nHello there ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry the jurors go back great Cathy\nYou liked that my news you like that the area [laughter] okay I\nI tell you what I always love hearing is that all that it may have more do you place great for me to keep the power\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nOh I've got two questions and then I've got a great little short Korean quick joke about their armored collar just at the end\nOf the first\nQuestion is who is credited with Jimmy\n... or the deciphering and learning to read hieroglyphics and then the second question is\nAre Howard graphics around go back there in Egypt in that area of the world the same however are good things that are found in the pyramids of Mexico central and South America\nIs the ... so the question is how are you asking if there are live here we're lipstick inscriptions in Beckley Jaffe is that what you're asking\nOr no I'm asking are the however graphics that are written and all the ... and Egypt on a pair of the civil war and go backwards at the all the same however graphics that are found on the pyramids and Mexico and central and South America\nAh okay I understand I'm not I don't think so they are there different ... there are different ... and it's interesting you asking this question because you are\nYou are basically giving a conclusion that I'm investigating as we speak you are saying that the era lipic inscriptions in ... in other words you're implying there is a there is there is writing there and um and I am currently looking into that I think you might be onto something\nNow there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry okay although I'm not an archaeologist I don't have any fancy degrees after my name on it but there are certain things that are are in\nNot only on the stones at at Beckley taffy but also in Egypt and tend to repeat around the world with different cultures are they the same I don't know there is an H on the belt that looks very similar to the age blocks and boom boom who are are they related I don't know\nRight there are some astrological signs in Beckley tabby\nAre they are they representing the zodiac ah that were in then Darrow and throughout Egypt and throughout the rest of the world after that are they the same I don't know but uh go Beckley Pepe being that old\nCertainly is indicating that they were the first is the oldest is it the same language\nAnd then that no I I don't think so but the zodiac symbols and some of the other symbolic she's like the I call it the army's age I'm the bells and then when it looks like but did that age that age is repeated a\nThere was a very exciting possibility um regarding that question to ask and go back to the ... the um and it's regarding the civil that you mentioned to me there's a very exciting possibility but I Can't prove it yet but I probably I might be able to prove it so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know\nWill do it right here on coast to coast oh there was one other uh one other point that I wanted to make about uh uh go Beckley taffy and it just got away from me bury it was right there but it just disappeared and I'll mention it later on in the show thank you bury\nNo problem thank for al\n... absolutely and uh the phone lines my new I expected this ah are completely jammed up let's get in one more call on all of the yeah let's let's go to this is a let's go to\nThe skin to my dad in New York my uh Europe next\nYes good morning ... and ... I Can't find the ... I'd like to know if he\nHad looked at any of that ... highly effective highly of any age and I and also I think that might be the one that deals with the founding medical knowledge that they had that if if I'm correct on that the ... and\nThe second part and I live over there and\n... and ... and ... and ... had can fit in some of the ... the African and African American ballet who study the net net net too at\nA we have a name on the language which is thought of that and that you're not a phrase ... say quit and whether he looked back\nPeople who call themselves a candidate for that in the kitchen you know before they get green came in and say they're going to have it be can that pilot ten minute when we got out way from for can they say and\nAlso um [noise] be what you think why that it was like I think we got came up with and can me [noise] what they're fine with the little if not what it is and the African or not that I'm thinking that they call it a little a ride\nOh oh oh that if you follow them like ... and I'll let you know the\nThank you bye ad great okay three great questions and my new I'm going to let's get to them but that just goes to show you the extent of knowledge here with the coast audience or they don't play around a ... the first\nQuestion um I I I Am I have heard of the pirates of any but uh the one that I have looked at more specifically regarding medical\nInformation is the ... a pirate such right actually in my\nBook um because on the reverse of two evils piracy there is an interesting calendar or that's next Egypt colleges and I think um I found a solution to a this calendar and that's described in the book\nUm and and yes it's a this is the ... so the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about a pirate that's I think over sixty foot long\nUh it describing seven hundred at these different seven hundred different ailments\nAnd their remedies um and this ... I Believe states to the middle kingdom and and reaches back a most likely a probably to him or taps time so um if they were they were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians I'm\nThe second part yeah Ken Mitch and which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a group that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so uh as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally\nWas a composite of two different cultures the one culture was a southern Egyptian culture and that script was mostly fanatic um and the evidence from that comes from children you Jay a king scorpions and that is I think were the African roots lie\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt uh probably from Bhutto Bhutto was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably as Amy uh with the live on\nAnd so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a big Charles so it was picked up perhaps\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa and maybe you know ... hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south\nAnd she brought up another really good point before we get to the break we got about thirty seconds Manu ... it was the Greeks adapting uh the analogy a chemistry coming from candidate right\nYes the issue I think she mentioned it stinks so uh my uh we we think that speaks was making before uh before Africa game I think there was a we would think it was the lioness and their name was making and by the way that's also probably an African of African origin\nLet's take a break right here coast to coast am it's\nAll Great Pyramid all Egypt to all night long\nOr gets tonight my new saves the day is paper is right there click on his website that coast to coast am we're going to discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us [noise]\nTo find\nOut more about tonight's gifts to log on to to ... am dot com\n[noise] even in a in the um me\nDo you want to earn that quality degree from a world renowned university if you answered yes to any of these questions Arizona State university is the perfect school for you\nArizona State university offered over one hundred and fifty highly ranked degree programs one hundred percent on line\nYou learn the same degree if you went on campus from wherever you are on your scheduled press I don't see why mine exceptional transfer credit for information tax law took three five five lines sapping\nLearned for yourself fly over here it's ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report and learn to thrive with Arizona State university for more information about all the one line popped live two three five five one second thoughts are probably eat two three five five wind sat on\nTheir retirement will show with government for a weekend just nine AM Ninety seven point was the big talker\n\nBack to the coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church I guess ... we're talking about uh the great pyramid and the discovery of not only chambers inside of the great pyramid\nBut his formula in his white paper they published last week and how to locate them and I want to say really quick minute that Twitter I expected this uh is is going a bit nuts right now and you can follow me on Twitter at a J Church ... church radio\nAnd post your questions or comments about Tonight Show either for me\nShe just came in before we get to a a page three twenty eight of of of this report a minute this is the question this is from ... Kim\nShe says is it true that the measurement of the great pyramid or possibly coordinate and that does coordinate point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinates to hand in\nHeaven yes um I haven't worked I propose\nIt's great to see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coast audience and and I guess like you're so there is so much information out there\nBut there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid\nYeah and this is one of those questions where the math of the great pyramid has revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alex Green who is look he's a Shakespeare expert and he has been able\nTo connect uh the uh the title page of the ... Shakespeare sonnet to the coordinates or not to heaven but uh of course Allen might say it is ever\nWrite a ... to the coordinates of the great pyramid and specifically ah the the coordinates that Alan just discovered a fall right next to the ... which is next to the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have 'em on coast a a very soon probably next month\nAnd is you're absolutely right in the title page of the sonnets with those Shakespeare\nAnd his work Allen greens work and deciphering that page and what he's revealed\nIs I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it\nIt is absolutely incredible and we'll have among coast next month okay so now that the top half of the pyramid yes a U.S said at the beginning of the show let's get to this it's a page number three twenty eight everybody in the ... the the ... report ... off\nThe top half you had said at the beginning of the show possibly six to eight additional chambers where we had been told there are none\nBy right and so um you know when we talked about a um a confident Rudolph got to break last time a Jimmy um remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring a found\nIs when you get to guns and brings door just before\nThe the the floor off the off the off the canal drops suddenly it's there's a depression\nAnd the way he is interpreted one of the two ways he interpreted that is there must be a space\nThat allowed that forward to cave in slightly\nSo that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know these courses that we've just been discussing there is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in and that might correlate with uh if I go back to three twenty six will quick\nThat could correlate with of course that's marked with ten twenty fifth\nUm and and then then let's go out and so you know there's there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and uh this particular space not been a detective ... again\nNow the road much or let's let's get to this first second and the\nUh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting at ... eighty four which is a shaft\n'em and are you going forward to every body of one of seven a and I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the construction\nThat have a different sides in a different thickness on these roads right\nRight right yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as a show and going all the way to the surface and that is incorrect so I just used the illustration is is an old illustration um so that it that particular chef did not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of twenty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basic the establishing in the lower part of the care of it I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with the ring in other words there is a space\nDesigned space not about you know an accidental space it designed space that correlates with each one of these particular courses\nNow you just got back from Egypt yes we have to discuss the ongoing move on a project their which\nUh did help them find this ... this new chamber above the grand gallery you describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nRight so I saw new detectors being place\nI'm at this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber\nAnd this time it's very obvious you walk up to a grand gallery to the king chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes and I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to come from and there was confirmed as they are getting\nNow for the audience tell them what to move on detectors actually do where do they used for\nRights these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so when a cosmic radiation hit the atmosphere of particle called them you want is created enemy on is\nA negative charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier ah than an electron but it can pop through solid matter it's travels at the speed of light it's lifetime is just over to second\nUm and but it can penetrate through solid objects and so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs\nAnd in this case you can basically quote unquote X ray the pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then uh it showed ... then you have a chance\nTo see a space or because the yarns will travel more rapidly through open air than you know through solid stone so if you have a space in the pathway of what you're what you're looking for then goes beyond will\nArrive more rapidly and they ... and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the effect\nWould these detectors placed in the grand gallery could they be used to find the\nThe chambers that you were proposing in the ever happened to me\nIt is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifact roles\nAnd I think they using this angle to confirm that the big voice is real but it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of\nDays at four in Ninety seven one big talker and\nYou see this show is a

more beer phone calls and more with by new when we come back after this short break this is coast to coast am [noise]\nAnd I'm I'm I think Roberts a bow vow was telling me about this I think or you can there's you can stand in there it's maybe six foot deep\nI'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind pouch but um but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that\nUm I can tell you that the uh you know the most ... um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth\nChartered under this beings are in this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling the quote was a crucial\nAnd he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it um there is a a there's another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves\nAre into this things and looking for chambers and then you know the one that should be just mentioned of course we know from seismic analysis that they are it to our space is under this beings and one of those basis specifically which is what Robert shock or\nOr was studying uh years ago um is has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a man made sort of features and we think that um it might be something that's of interest\nYeah he did the seismic research there and the both of you are looking to go back with another research expedition to hopefully drilled right\nYeah yeah first well what we are what we would like to do first is to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced a size ... graffiti and maybe electric conductivity studies and to really get a very detailed look\nEspecially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know if you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven\nAnd ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw a space about two meters a deep and uh and and then Roberts ah you know did his studies couple a couple of years later\nAnd Robert is estimating that this phase is five meters deep so we have a little bit of a deficit problem and then of course you know that's I of us in marketing or drilled in that area but we think that they missed it uh and I mean they\nAre they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were too far west from where we think the chamber is so they didn't really uh you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them and of course they had other reasons why they were drilling so what we want you to do is you know just like a you know just like a radiologist you know the first one to do a non evasive study and really finding out the space\nAnd when we have a good idea where it is then with permission of course then work try a small probe into that space and see what's in it\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey has talked about there's this this this rumor has been going around yea for quite a while it would just be great to finally uh put this to bed wouldn't\nOh absolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water\nAnd in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of the valley temple and sinks temple and there was a little depression and it's wet um you can just you can just see the the water coming up and if if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber\nAnd so you know if if let's say

very difficult project but it's doable Robert thinks it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly\nSpeaking of the things that came in on Twitter this is from Baldwin is uh on Twitter and I have heard that it does things may have been a woman's face and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small for its body\nYes well if we think\nWe think it was a female lie and so that part is partially we agree with that yes I don't think it was a person's head so I'm like we think that was a lie in this there before and the head of the line as was weak carved into a what we see today\nNow um I Know that you tend to be a little reticent to talk about alien jury tee when it comes to ...

universe\nYou know the holographic universe I don't know if people are following this but it you know this one way that you can explain everything as a projection and if that's the case\nA dentist like Robert Duvall proposed in Cosby gloom is one way you can explain or some of these contacts is there may be a message that gets broadcasts across the universe through you know through um\nAh through a quantum field and that message ends up on the earth and somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid um I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is\nBut we have to have some proof I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see some solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line right Robin Vancouver Rob really quick before we get the break what do you have for a minute\nAbsolute runners regard as really quickly a

have to you know I've been I have to mention shop you know so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this these on logistics basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and just scan from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is that I think it's possible that the scanner was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that is that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm seeing that could be illogical and chop you're dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know if you have to pay for a but he still thinks it's possible that there are a logistical spaces in it but you know the that others may so we agree there are

million dollar question Mary and thank you for that uh my new gardening beaten in Egypt\nYeah I well first of all I Want to recommend an author to you a merry I'm David roles so he's a he's really done some excellent work on a a a basically tracing biblical stories back to Egypt\nUm and so you may find some answers or you know with him so I think he's producing a television series and he's with books about it um those are great documentary a couple of years ago by I think in the holy if I remember this correctly\nUm but yeah I think it's an interesting subject I think uh I think the uh the early ... when they were in Egypt um I think\nUh there's ... Joseph I'm that's what the role is describing Joseph real figure and uh it's in a in a in a place called a virus which is in the delta and how to pass\nThe uh uh into them in a pyramid and he was such an important official at the court\nAnd I'm a and then all of a sudden I'm you know this virus community disappears indices archaeological evidence and well piece together um and David role is basically saying that\nAh where are you worried historians got it wrong is that they they were looking for the biblical story in a in the new kingdom and it's it David role is finding that it was probably a couple of centuries earlier\nThis I just came in on Twitter this is from Jay and Jay's as I heard that surgeon tools for found indeed you shouldn't pyramids that doctors use now true or false\nUm I\nWell what was found is that a is a a tool that looks like a ... a like a small it's like a fish tell 'em what on I I'm not sure that was a surgeon's tool but of course we don't know um it was found in the I think it was in the northern\n... a shaft of the queen chamber by a waymen Dixon\nUm and he uh and it's now and the British Museum a with a with a ... with a ground ball um but whether or not that was a surgery with ... and ... other than that I don't know of any surgical tools found inside of the games the pyramids\nLet's go to bill in Oregon bill you're up next time goes to my new\nName on there Hi Jimmy yeah this is a really academic discussion tonight and I've got nothing you know nothing against that congratulate you on your discovery\nBut my question is um okay so I just want you to speculate a little bit is that you just chambers or for construction in engineering could they be like for instance\nFor architects to put gold on the Internet or could um if their theological could be you know some sort of burial chambers for for those um the king wanted to proceed him into the um afterlife\nYeah great question yeah great question bill I'm ... I'm Glad you asked that because I Will\nSpeculate now I I'm I'm looking forward to ... I think because there is obviously I'm proposing up to ten chambers I was thinking well what if it's the logical what could that be and I think the answer is the end they add\nSo in the ... ah the ah the hopeless was known for the center of the warship after nine major God this kind of like the pantheon of of the ancient Egyptians\nAnd I think ah these chambers are dedicated to each one of these deities\nAnd and the one that's dedicated to sauce is the one\nThat is the crucial chamber or wherever we may find the kind of things that you just mentioned are but I'm suspecting there could be piracy world and there are with inscriptions\nI'm so that would be very exciting is that if we're if that were ever to be found\nUm but I think it's along the lines of that and if it's a logistical then I'm all I think I'm with John P o die think this is still on the table that there may have been space is there that pulse of workers to pull up the stones or to the top it's possible\nUm and we'll just have to wait for the next scan I think the next county will give us some new information\nNow I Am heard some rumors minute that they have already gotten inside of the new chamber above the grand gallery and have removed items from there and they will be on display when the new grand museum opens next month\nYeah I I'm not I happened to those rumors but um I Am a I wouldn't be all I wouldn't be completely surprised let's put it that way\nIt would certainly help the tourism I mean in terms of less right\nWhich has dropped off I have heard you know you just got back from Egypt I haven't heard from so many friends that have been going to Egypt for decades\nAnd that you can as a tourist because ... years past it was crowded all the buses were there you had to wait in line and there was a you know thousands of people on the ... black but today you can burn truly be the only person there\nYeah that I had there was a couple of days when I felt like that Jimmy I um you know it was not\nThere were there were parts of think he's a plug toll where I was the only person walking around besides the guards and the camel riders\nSo yeah tourism has been down and they um you know they want to build a new museum and uh and of course they have to if they discover something they are they are going to show it to the world so that people come and look at it I\nThat's why I'm hopeful that if they have something that they haven't shown us yet that we'll we'll find out about\nThis uh this is from Twitter this is from David I Love this question actually did the Nazis research

I don't know you know if when the when a decrease goes and investigate those things that they're all published a data you know there's no way for me to know what they found\nUm you know so your guess is as good as mine but I Am based on based on to the chamber under the left part that we think exists and we think it's a manmade chamber I Am pretty sure that's not a blind chamber I think that chamber may just be the entry all to something that goes further back\nYou know um and so yeah I Am with you I think uh I think that there is more more than than we know and maybe they know it and they haven't published it\nJay y ... told me that he was down in that very same area\nAnd he's walking around he was alone and there was nobody around him so he goes to the back of the things in the south side by the tail and he looks down on the ground and he sees what he thinks is a piece of wood covered with dirt\nYeah so he he leads over grabs would mix it up and it's a a piece of plywood\nAnd he'd lifted up and looked and it was an entry way it was a tunnel going straight down and as he was looking into the whole a guard came up and yelled at him he dropped the wood and he was escorted out of there\nYeah and he's a Jimmy I'm here to tell you I no matter what I personally lifted up a piece of wood and looked into a tunnel underneath the south side\nOf the rear flanked by the scale of this things and he saw himself but yet they'll say that it doesn't exist but you saw with his own eyes\nI I don't have any doubts about\nLet's see I think that there is there's there are spaces under this things the main question is does it go anywhere or there's just a blind pouch that's the main question\nWell you brought up something else too about I'm Andrew Collins now he is he is that is one of the craziest videos I've ever seen I mean it and is nerve wracking and if you've got claustrophobia in any way you watch that video and you almost can't get through it but\nHe did find a a tunnel a that started in the north west corner where the bird uh two was but and he finds a hole in the back of one of the tunes are for these birds that were there\nAnd it turned out to be hundreds and hundreds of feet long been stretched out and appeared to continue underneath the pyramid complex there wasn't supposed to be anything there then ... denied that there were any tunnels there\nLater went on his own expedition and film crew and went into the tunnel complex which again was supposed to exist but it does\nBut there's also a potential pathway from the ... or from the uh the Cyrus shaft\nUm you know that's I I don't know if it was ever explored but I Know Robert was down there ... was down there filming and it was actually a documentary years ago\nI'm In you know he was really excited about the shaft um of course Egypt colleges are telling us that these are you know late period shops and these are not from they don't get to the old kingdom\nUm but you know I'm not so sure it might be that the upper the I'm Talking about the specifically I'm Talking about the old Cyrus chef it's possible that the upper two layers are late kingdom but the the lower level is much older we we don't we I don't think we know for sure\nAnd it may could act um but yeah without a probing um nowadays we have the technology to probe very small spaces um but yeah until we get the data we just don't know\nYeah you're talking about the two of us iris\nYeah the to write the access is on the south side of the ... of ... costs way uh and then that's how you and then you go under it and then uh it's three layers or or three levels rather and the lowest one is the one where you had the ... submerged in water and\nThe surrounding database and that sort of the shape of the ear cliff for house I'm a and a and you know it had this conference inside and and the the four pillars around and it was fascinating\nUm you know this ah just some the symbolism of it but the dating of it I mean I'm a little bit doubtful about the official story\nWell he went down almost a hundred feet and the end of Hitler's that were surrounding the area where there is our topic is again underwater or those four pillars had fallen over but it was something that was also supposed to exist on the plateau in there or was\nThat's right and so any inventories the ... you know we talked about it earlier there are so Robert and I think there are the the the myth dimension of the house of Cyrus\nOr on the inventory steal it actually may be referring to two that are ... Cyrus shop we think it's possible that it's referring to that or Campbell's too now my cleaner is saying that Congress to them is a late period tune belonging to\nA no official called um ... cop or something like that\nI Can't remember the name but again this is the same issue you know how do we know for sure that that wasn't a an older too and then it was being intruded on\nYou know we don't think we know\nOf ... before we had to the break ... ... how much do you think is still love to be discovered on the gays applied to there's an awful lot of sand there\nYeah but well my my favorite place to look at it and and of course Robert Robert's favorite place to look would be a besides the you know uh besides that left paw\nIs in front of the two temples if we could dig deep in front of the temple is you know where people nowadays uh watch the light show or there could be the actual entry to this passage\nThat we think is under the things it could be in front of this thing's temple and then the other thing is we I predict and they tore the paper we're predicting\nThat there may have been also a temple or east of the valley temple a and that was dedicated to Cyrus and that would be also underground so that will be one of my favorite places and then you mentioned is things on the other side is there's things on the west side\nYou know of course if that's a great place to look a is there another sings maybe those three places will be my favorite places to go\nWhen you look at when I find the most intriguing about the gays applied to of course everything facing west in Beijing the Nile uh there's there's a lot there had been for reasons with the causeway and the entrances and so forth but\nWhen you look at the original survey maps that were done in the Eighteen hundreds of the ... applied to there is an awful lot a that is being ... the uh the pyramid complex facing a west in northwest there's a lot there and\nUh not only were the tunnels represented all the way back into the early Eighteen hundreds but there is a construction then is represented in those original survey maps there really hasn't been explored sense\nYeah yeah that's right that's right there there there are some places in Egypt that cannot be explored because there are military\nZones or you know for example the the northern a pyramid of why it or are we on a you know this is an incredible amazing place a with a huge trends and this Oval Office placement\nUm but there's nothing nothing going on since the sixties because it's a military zone so yeah I mean to your point in the in the west the old way out and I do notice for a fact I don't know if this is a military zone right now but you know some areas are basically off limits and yeah there was secrets hiding under the

my new a question\nAre you ready if I can answer absolutely if the uh you know in Christopher done and others have talked about uh the the pyramid being a machine or possibly a generator of power and energy or if that is the case Larry what would they have used it for\n... to ... to provide a labor free energy\nYeah you know what and Larry thank you for the phone call my new that's exactly what a Christopher done\nUh as I said to me last week while he's talked about it for years of course um it wasn't a big revelation with me but that it was energy for the for the people of Cairo in

just fits all the observations into a model and that is you know if I if I were doing the investigation he'd be the first call to have them on board um you know so I yeah I he's amazing absolutely I I Love the interview and I've read has worked before and very impressive first\nLet's go to wild card was go to Carol in Charleston D.C Carol you're up next on coast\nHow Hi Carol hello Carol\nWow quite well several years ago oh well last only twice found I thought oh lost the Cleopatra him all underground oh well we're\nNo I as far as I Know it I I I haven't looked into this in detail as far as I Know but to them is not discovered but you know maybe it has been discovered and it's not published as possible\nWhat was your second question Carol\nAh without being in archaeology is how do you go about getting involved when did that research grants\nYeah that's a great question I so yeah I have to I Want to make sure I explained to every one so I'm not an archaeologist I'm also not a credential Egypt calls is this is for me it started as a hobby and all of course it's a serious endeavor\nOr you have to be associated with an Institute a research place or a university which I Am now I'm a you know association affiliated with Boston University\nUm and so then you can apply for permits and you have to you know you have to do the application you have to\nUh they have to review the application and they may say no and you don't have a recourse um you know so we'll have to see if they allow us but if it's not me it's okay or somebody else you know my my I think you know I wanted to get the information out there are other people can see it other researchers\nAnd they might be able to get a permit to investigate further and that's okay with me\nShould do the same thing Carol are you researching on your own now\nI'm thinking and feeling like they found and I carry and why ... added that in the national news twice\nYeah and and Carol ... one of the things that that I like to do and I encourage others is\nBlog right research and and and publish and self publish yourself and and continue because once you start to do that because I Do it myself and and certainly so does my new that others out there\nAre attracted to you and they will find your information and then they started sharing their information with you and you suddenly have a network right in front of you so I I encouraged I encourage blogging and creating your own website just like my new did and and look what happens in the end\nLet's let's go east of the Rockies is going to Manuel in San Antonio Texas

stuff into\nYeah you're absolutely I'm not hearing I'm not hearing the question\nI mean he was saying that you had brought up a more why you answer this question that why hasn't this been brought up before and it always comes down to money that's what it was his point but the first\nOr the birds a dinner represented a throughout different cultures around the world on a different temples and and pyramids and we're seeing it over and over\nRight so the big the the the most important question in my mind okay which is probably the same question that uh you know early research has worked

the one gift that you can visit or use every single day and tomorrow and the day after that and for that singular perfect present that's all wrapped up in a boat for this planet and every one\nOn it it's the great pyramid of Egypt you don't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving ... the great pyramid\nIs forty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly level rock pointing exactly as true north south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years\nAllegedly and yet we know nothing about it a few\nShort decades after Cleopatra's rain a sparrow any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egypt should history\nForgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her nobody knew how to read I have ... nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they traveled to Cairo they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that you know and the answer\nAir quotes we don't know you know but it's really\nAre you take a moment and you you asked yourself how did I get here but it basically you know I I was just like anyone else watching\nHistory Channel Discovery Channel and you know off and on about Egypt and it was interesting but it wasn't really such a you know it wasn't really a ... and focus and then a ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the wind mystery by Robert Duvall and\nThat changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the Germans were aligned with the stars and it's just that that just kind of opens up the up and and so I started reading a little bit more and uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off\nUm and and then I said I have to you know I I wanted to meet some of these people I started a you know communicating and I've met\nA Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shock or a few months later and um you know it's just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing I'm with you a couple of years in\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those at length tonight on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the paper section everything listed in the row a new is the first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight\nUh you and a Robert Duvall and Robert shock sat down and started discussing uh the the snakes and published that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\nYeah what you know this is a this goes back to override mystery so I you know while I was reading things I haven't met the two gentlemen and yet the authors um\nI I was a you know I talked to myself if if an architect ah builds the three pyramids a and a line and and\nWant it to align them with the three belt starts off Iran they had to be some kind of record and you know it was it your pauses believed that uh the architect of the great care of it the first one of the three it was you know\nAnd so I looked at the stature I started to look at the stature of email and then we looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while I'm at so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on that are on the pedestal if that statue\nUm I noticed it and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia it gave me the or the book the that they just have co authored origins of the things which is amazing both by the way it is\nYeah um and so I was reading the book and you know and Robert section is developing a you know something that he knows dreams the law which is you know in front of the parts of the ... between the positive things and\nThat was a a so he was talking basically about the things that this guy and he developed a part of the book and\nAnd then I asked myself well what about this things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it um as far as we know before the servants were built if there was a things then it's it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been a mention of it\nAnd that's how this came together so then I remember at the statue I remembered the line is on the pedestal\nOne thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page\nRobert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or at the um\nI think it was caused the origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast at night I knew I only you know I\nHad to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I\nDidn't even have to try it just came out in less than ... minutes and we uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it is a this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight you know why is it that the and one of the ... applied to in general but you had the great pyramid the grades things are two things that dominate everything that you can see for ...\nHe's not documented the anywhere\nIn Egypt shouldn't history where you would think well you know the ... love to write everything that he loved to go to tell their story and not only that but taxes and in accounting and seasons everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except\nFor the great strengths and the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nYeah that that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy on I mean you know you want to answer you could give us that maybe we just we have a positive records or the records were destroyed um but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or or maybe total absence\nUm and of course that was the problem with this famous you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into Egyptology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nIn the scriptures that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something that leads to things um\n[noise] the pyramids we um you know when you are next so that when you buy the great care of it there's a tune from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years after a you know who fu ... was alive and if you walk into that too there's actually a reference\nTo the great pyramid and also to the ... in in in\nThe two of its called uh the whole rise of coup food and next to it it's the um the you know to a conference grade so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid so they call that cover his grade and coup whose job it was called the rise of coup who\nAnd so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plateau and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is declaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou earn to the pyramid yeah you would expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have but but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction\nAnd forget about the other something about how was builder who built it or the year was built you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that is very confused all\nThe way to have auditors um you know fifth century but the you know this was in during Persian rule um two thousand years after the fact and and what it is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know you're saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the park so and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up the box but you would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account\nOf how it was done but uh it's not\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just is confusing is the great things you know we also have those same issues and if it wasn't for the dream Stella well and the inventory Stella ... we may not know anything at all\nBut yes\nThat was the dream still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn of a um twentieth century that may be tougher laws to fourth who is the author of the dream still up between the parts of the things\nThat he is the one who feel that that was actually being debated um but uh and there is a there is a small\nReference to pray but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it definitely does not say that he built it\nUm and so that's the dream still at the event towards the ... the other hand it's very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when ... ... what actually ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same at the ... the Greek name Cooper's the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that even towards the law says very unequivocally when ... came to the ... things already exist that in fact it was broken you repair it and then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid of his queen Knutson\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now the coast to coast am primarily to be church I guess my news said ... and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nWind up more of us and I just logged on Tuesday in\nThis is at home kind of luck dot com boom luck dot com Ninety One\nGoes to goes more stimulating dog\n\nWalking back to the coast to coast am I'm used to be church it's the great pyramid all might be more we get to the great pyramid\nOr ... minute said Sunday and my new uh we were talking about the inventory ... and the dream seller right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward and in the dreams della uh most of the forum\nSays mentions and in illustrates two things is there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second snakes well there's two things there\nI Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second thing being in the sky I think it actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a ... he is there a second thanks\nFor great question on ... so that was for that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the seconds things uh as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question and it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double edits things\nAre and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is\nA ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things and these depictions are um you know they're on the unmistakable\nSo so the answer to this question specifically of course it hasn't been found there is but there are stories uh Arab historians referred to\nAn actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build mosques\nSo they're they're apparently was physical things are on the other side of denial but it's there it's things buried under the sense that say west of ah coffers pyramid it's possible\nThe\n... and ... you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repaired this things but build the great pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just to repair guy but then he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why the discrepancy\nYeah uh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as yet of course Egypt colleges most Egypt causes do not accept the inventories de la as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we countered there's arguments so we're actually saying is it is\nAuthentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so to your question um they're the uh you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS and their specific symbol we discuss the last time is a symbol\nThat in Egypt she means to me means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the with the word for building which is a bad\nAh so they'll come the combination is bad will happen if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of the sellout a is a is a strip of text where you know the German building as mentioned and yeah the verb that this is not further\nA qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuild\nUm is that a hundred per cent proof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the ... of ... that was found in ... in the right to see\nYou know they are saying well you okay this is the pirates talks about to a store and being ... a ... a a but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that is correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and uh who was a it means they interview you have written the other day he made a good point you said that uh he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was back failed\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour activities that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up to courses and then you back so later so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind about\nIt and there was a quite a bit of relatives or a you know pyramids that coup was dealing with uh also one of the games are plateau right could there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramid\nThere are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes\nYes yes there is a there is a reference to a head Knutson 'em and hit Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who's the news and so she was supposedly it's clean\nAnd uh he built a pair of it for her the southern most of the three ah off the tree a queen permits that are on an indie east field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but\nThe human Tori Spelling it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting to sell out because they're saying\nIs no evidence that they knew it was a print says so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually ah\nSubmit prove that she I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we've we think the poop shows that she was a print says\nSo that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then don't you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or\nA an old Cyrus on this Stella and that those are much further reasons why Egypt colleges reject this dog because they're saying\nYou know if this were an oath getting them story or at the time of coup who he's got a you know ISIS on her side as we're not yet a work being worship there weren't not official states sanctions or in the eighties and\nWe also you know try to diffuse that argument as well I'm like you know it's it's a contentious I I I don't want to make it sound like we have the house or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nAnd then there's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids are crumbling they don't even look like they were built by the same engineers around the same answer with this\nRight and those would be more simple to build and you would you would expect those to be just as elegant even you know more complex yeah but they're not and they're the stone work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing are is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just a comment that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship\nAnd I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality of their smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I but I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old King I'm\nI'm a you know middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the workman ship definitely declined um after the old getting them\nNow let's get to or what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yeah after we have been told over and over again\nAnd it it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there\nWell clearly that is not the case\nIs something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is one of the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing um and the and what I like about it is that it was non invasive you didn't have to drill holes you didn't have to you know like a\nSo much and barking and noisy yelling at our role is to take three steps

[noise]\nAnything ... usually does today's the day to celebrate all roaches Reno like Victoria ... on it is a minority grouchy grouchy grouchy also say\nTeaches us that it's good to spend time processing or negative emotions yes I had a great lesson in that in the last\nA week or so somebody that works for me and um we're back and forth it's interesting how you don't really get the true meaning of words by looking at the flat screen you just kept getting the emotion sometimes people get upset about things that they think are being said or interpretations of words\nThat need to be explained and I think that's a anyway I I like I've always liked the characters on a Sesame Street a Nashville gross day Oscar um cookie monster big bird Sesame Street theme\nSong on the day even though ... so we're in\nTo where the air is sweet boy\nYou know the I Know and you know your two lines ahead of the\nEarly ... for the job he big bird [noise]\nUh was the big bird is saying listen and I love ... [noise]\nNo no I was sick or out there that are in big bird\n... here in the trash can [noise] oh yeah [laughter]\nBut hey you out\nAnd get to Sesame Street [noise] as long as we're on to the\nTelevision world of children let's go to the adult world Jennifer Garner has been speaking about a ... of alias the TV show that became her sort of signature entry into being a big time star\nOr she says that there is there's\nSomething to it shows on from two thousand one or two thousand six\nVictor Garber who played her father on the show and pretty much plays or farther than real life or the or there was a press event for her new show called camping on HBO she said quote I heard that there is an alias ... happening but no one talked to me about it\nOr comment marks a change for past remarks where she said she feels like a revival of the series is up to Jay Jay Abrams that's where he first got known to I think isn't it big time oh yeah yeah\nRight she said quote it would be totally different\nBut if they didn't have me on as a gift I Would be very very angry but I Can't imagine it being that serious here because I haven't heard anything about it from anybody is kind of like the discussion of the ... to get a twenty four and what goes on who's going to be in and\nWho is that what ... what of what value with this show be if it didn't have Jennifer Garner and Victor Garber it it it ... that's what people remember and its recent enough\nIs only ten years ten twelve years ago that it would be um I Would be a ... page who you're going to put in there\nThat have you know they keep rebooting stuff and they and for whatever reason it's very rare that and and I think it's a it's a mistake but\nThere are some reason it's rare that they involve the original cast and I I think you know there there there's one great example on the cw the new the new version of the flash\n'em that team that came back I don't know maybe five years ago six years ago something like that\nAnd they brought the original flash from the nineties he's now the dad on the show of the of the young flash so they did it the right way because they got the old fan who now are hooked on the new show and it kind of something for everybody and I think that's the smart way to do it when Dallas came back\nIt was the same thing that was brilliantly done I watched it with my mom I was too young to watch it when it was on the first time that my mom loved it so we are we watched it together and it was something we really liked but for some reason I don't know the ... of these shows they can Agnew into consideration that there was an older audience they're\nRight magnum PI I thought I wasn't going to like I've seen a couple of episodes on Monday nights and it uh it's okay that great but it's okay\nAnd how much guy All right Tom Selleck is so iconic\nRight he's not a Tom Selleck by any stretch the ... and he doesn't have the caliber and they don't have to have that kind of money for him he's okay there's a woman playing the role of Higgins who's a Brit who's a an interesting character in her own right but there's a lotta contrived\nCircumstances there are a lot of these shows are there's a lotta can drive ins in it and the show seems to be somewhat contrived but it's it's ...\nIt's kind of like Hawaii Five o which is now lasted as a re route for nine years or something that's been around\nAnd it's I don't know anyone who's ever seen it but it seems to actually yelling [laughter]\nI said but the only reason I watch it actually is funny as it seems is because I Love the theme I watched the first four or five six minutes and then the theme comes on and I'll sit on the couch a move run\nBy the time to ah started out on a\nShow just for the theme song yeah seems always great thing about you do now is you can just watch that thing over and over again anytime you what I think I ... I make it your ring tone on your phone and then you don't need to wanna\nI was going to put this [laughter]\nOr maybe even this it'd be better if I put this on my phone [laughter] oh boy\nAnd no one will ever call and the right thing to do All right so let's go wherever the listings tonight they're Victoria\nWell on ABC eight pm tonight as a brand new dancing with stars it's week four of the competition and uh some ... some of the past contestants we'll be back if you're a fan we got is\nThe important word that's what I've heard from a lot of people love the show that his are weak line up of they run out of stars apparently\nWell you know it's funny ... I mean this is going back now a couple of years ago and a ... sort of known as the roast master he does all the comedy central roast and he said you know it's not dancing with the stars it's dancing with the vaguely familiar at this point that who else is left to right on through yeah they've gone through or almost like deem the plots maybe\nThere's a brand new and I can get out of Reagan dance\nYeah sure why not on CBS at eight PM there's a brand new episode of the neighborhood and uh that's a comedy that saw with Cedric the entertainer um next Greenfield\nOkay that's what I Want to hear what the allies of the show okay\nAnd this is a white guy moved into a black neighborhood that's supposed to be the the that's supposed to be set up and says Cedric the entertainer is on on the street in the guy comes running up and his shorts and says I rather or whatever it is and he looks at his white legs and he says the\nLast time I saw that much white media was fried ended a bucket\n[laughter] that's the\nGuy that that's the that's the humor level that you\nTo a ... you know well there's also eight PM an on NBC you can see a brand new episode of the voice of the blind audition continue if you like this the or that show the resident that is on eight pm on Fox that's a season two episodes for and if you're into some Halloween baking the food network has got you hooked up all night\nCooking contest and I'm cupcakes and all kinds of spook ... things that you can make and uh and then later on if there's an episode of nine one one on Fox at nine PM and ah if you are into magnum PI that also brand new tonight CBS nine pm as well\nAnd a brand new episode of bowl at ten pm on CBS I Know that's a\nGood that is a good show there are a lot of good the Michael whether we has proven himself to be someone who can carry a show well is doing very well and the ratings again this year it's a good show have you ever notice it yet but I Want to spook secular really you couldn't do any better than that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "15"}
