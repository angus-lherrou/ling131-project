having me\nI Want you to tell\nAre amazing audience that will truly be very sympathetic with you tonight exactly what happened to row because this story is so important for so many people to understand a but let's start let's start from the beginning he was a vibrant young man what happened\nYes Ralph was a vibrant young man with no\nMedical history whatsoever was admitted to the University of Missouri Kansas City prestigious six year bachelor degree I mean the program or children graduate in six years with a BA in an empty [noise]\nAnd after completing first year that program he got food poisoning [noise]\nWent to a hospital in Kansas City it was administered very controversial drug\nBy the name of ... gland Ari G. L. A. and the generic version of it ... this is a black box drug that was used as a first line of defense or something like food poisoning\nAnd from the moment that drug was injected within days Ralph both physical and mental condition began to deteriorate and there are many many many cases of this that can be found on the Internet\nAnd when you see and begin to deteriorate physically and mentally did you notice that change with him\nWithin a day or two he and one of his medical school room mates had done research\nAnd the changes I noticed or his anxiety began to increase he began to complain of strange pains that he had never had before and this began a slow deterioration that I Would call something like this doing this whole lot of the human body\nAnd at this point Ralph took his life\n[noise] over the course of a early twenties Seventeen he was I brought him back home to St Louis\nAnd he made three attempts on his life to take himself out of this horrific conditions\nAnd back home to St Louis and he\nMade three attempts on his life\nTo take themselves out of this horrific condition that was bringing him intense pain and from what I understand the form of anxiety times a hundred\nA man on his last attempt he was successful and um I did hold his hand and was there and he passed away\nHow old was he just he was twenty [noise] and how did he take his life\nHe tried with two other attempts that were unsuccessful\nBut on the last attempt a he used a gun and at that time I wasn't there he sent me a text that really began the marking over a year but the text came to me at exactly eleven eleven\nAnd that's where we are going to talk about tonight the ... that have occurred for you especially after this tragedy occurred I mean I remember being in St Louis when I heard about this\nAnd it was a was a shocking situation for anybody to have to go through a ... it it is my biggest nightmare of course as a parent\nTo lose your trial before before you go and uh I could only to what you were going through at the time with this kind of pain but the secret ... then started so tell us a little bit about the name Institute and the twenty two which is the name of your book\n[noise] I\nI looked at that tax George again and again and again and in some way I found solid and connecting with that last tax and as I began to stare at it again and again it occurred to me Lebanon eleven well\nRalph was born on two twenty two [laughter] and so the number twenty two began to resonate with me a firm that was the beginning point I Would say of that resignation\nI Want to tell our audience this little secret to city here when I was talking with Jonathan several weeks ago about this situation in his book and of course the tragedy that occurred now you mentioned that you don't use the sun roles\nA was a you know just a delightful young guy and he's ... use the name Gabriel of course uh you took that name as well did you not\nI did ... middle name was Gabriel and so I changed my middle name to Gabriel I felt they Eunice and no one is in doing that it was symbolic was spiritual and I'm a brought me significant meaning\nAnd on and I was talking to Jonathan and I said to my dad's name was ... and uh you know he was born on February twenty seconds which is the same date that Ralph\nWas born in these weird ... started coming up all over again and Jonathan's eyes just opened up in in everything else do you believe that your son is Cindy ... messages Jonathan through these strange occurrences\n[noise] I I Do believe that I I've always been a rational analytical regimented person in in my personal life in my profession and Avi aiding and\nWith the pain of what happened\nIt began to open up my thought process and I said wait a minute there's just got to be more and I took down the wall of what was my personal rationality and began to read I began to study\nA I've been studying the ancient ... text in Hebrew I've looked through other religions and mystical world and I do believe that the in finance\nIs communicating with me\nWhat message do you think Ralph is trying to pass on to you what does he want you to know\n[noise] I find comfort in knowing that he's letting me know that the existence of him has not seized\nLife on earth for him has seized but the existence and the cosmic soup if you will does not stop and that has brought me tremendous comfort\nI I was going to say you must you in a very strange way of course to give you the kind of comfort to know that his existence continues that he's out there somewhere\nA in trying to get you little messages every once in a while just to make you aware that you know hey Dan I'm here\n[noise] well you know it it hasn't been always once in a while sometimes it's a little more

look at it a few times but it was twenty two men and\nDo you get behind the car and you look in a license plate and you see twenty two there to do these numbers pop up all over the place\nYou know they do pop up to me and at times I think they're popping up and at times I think they're not coincidences so I really created a work for myself out of coincidences I'm calling them coincide and says\nBecause as it on a recent trip to Los Angeles and I'm thinking a lot about him and hotel I check into in the hand me a key and I walk up to the room and the room number is to twenty two\nJeeze

Jonathan\nI Know how tough this was for you when this tragedy occurred how're you doing now\n[noise] well George I'm I'm definitely doing better [noise]\nOne of the things that's really helped me to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the Internet and in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings has this ability\nBut I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body as the finite zone and for the anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body and so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite\nAnd so in meditative thought and thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability in the infinite zone where each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat did you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\nI have to say that I I question that\nI didn't think about it much and ever since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nTrying to think culturally then we'll get to them in a second but there are three strange occurrences that occurred I Want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the ... driver situation what happened there\nSo about eight months ago I had a I got in a new or from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want\nAnd he looked at me and a very strange stare and said\nI'll just tell them Ralph set it off and I looked\nAt him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said\nNo she how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] I Love it how about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning and after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it\nAnd the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\n[noise] I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and said we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\nShe's against timing in secret the city again and then you had an occurrence with some strange bedroom lights\n[noise] well I\nMoved out of our own rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and I turned off the lights and I was leaving in the house was empty and the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me during the lights back\nBut the light switch back down and put it back up put it back down and they went off\nThe lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off and at that time I left the house\nAnd just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\nIt was a point where you got angry about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing [noise] um [noise] I don't\nI don't fault Tam I have struggled to try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shielded themselves from any and all liability from every American citizens\nWell they're they're protected by the federal law aren't they\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the\nThey're protected by a federal law aren't they\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJonathan was was ... subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\nNo Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student or frequently making jokes he was just if you ask because friends they would portray just the most honest\nI'm likeable young man you could you could think of\nNot to go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stand ... they take some stuff uh you know they go to the bathroom as often as they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the hospital I\nI think I think he was vomiting profusely there was a lot of blood or\nHe was out with his friends who were all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that cool\nWell I got the call after medication had been given to him about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOh okay let's go to some culture for your job and let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington questions story Hi Patty\nHi uh I've I've got a little story and I hope it's relevant to this synchronous cities that I think I've got more and then you can shake a stick at\nUm it started with my son who incidentally was taken away from me when he was born we somehow managed to to make a connection\nThat we can look back for each other on that he was born on my birthday three minutes apart from the same time I was born in from their synchronous cities\nJust roll in um um we were both born nine fourteen I was nine fourteen fifty two he was nine fourteen sixty eight every number we have to do it\nThis is not at nine I mean ... of fourteen or a seven where it's divisible by seven\nYeah um so you get certain numbers as Jonathan gets twenty two you get certain numbers popping up all the time too\nYeah exactly well uh you know the first thing was we noticed my initials P R R P um his mom name was Donna I'm my dad's name is Don but he hasn't\nTopped of parents are exactly the same age as my parents to the air and the month July Nineteen twenty nine and November Nineteen thirty one and I mean that kind of blew me off my socks\nPending let me ask you like him why did they take him away from you as a child\nI was he was born on may sixteenth birthday huh OK okay I it was it was better for him and me I understand that happened\nThat way and I mean it was it was excruciating let him go but we did find each other twenty six years later and that's another one in synchronous these out of twenty six years we crossed in the mail looking for each\nOther and as it is is he still with us\nAbsolutely okay he lived with\nMe for seven years and they moved back to his home state of Utah and um we were both born on an air force bases hey it didn't this hatred yesterday's and they're beyond coincidence\nSo empty when ours he was

Morgan adding one million ounces to their stockpile of a hundred and thirty three million ounces\nAnd last time we talk to you told us about China's plans to build a huge solar farms which could spike sober demand we all should talk about California being the first state to require new homes they have short are there other states\nMaybe you're in the process but the latest trend is community solar what's with that\nIt probably won't have ... it's probably too cold have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter Liberia it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light gays from earth is that the border between the hype rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure 'cause we don't know what is beyond the planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what the border of\nWhat was it that made you an astronomer realize that something ten times the mass of earth could be there in the first place\nThe clue that there is another planet out in the solar system\nReally came from looking at the very most distant objects that are in orbit around the sun well beyond Pluto they travel extreme distances and all these ones that are this far away all sweep often one particular direction and there's no reason they should there should be randomly around the sky\nThe fact that they're all off in this one direction can only be explained by the presence of a planet that perturbation their orbits and keeping them piled up in that direction\nAnd that what the new headlines in October of twenty Eighteen are about is one of the smaller objects that are being swept off by whatever the massive look called planet nine that you discovered in twenty six team\nThat's exactly right although I don't use the word discovered yet I Would say we proposed the planets and when we see it it will have been discovered\nWhat do you use any two people who ask questions about rogue planet and the ... of the ... area and in all of that because it does come up a lot\nWhat exactly are rogue planet how can a planet be wandering in the universe between sellers distancing galaxy\nThere certainly are these wandering planets rogue planet and they come about from\nThe same sort of reason that we think that planet nine is out there they certainly formed around a star just like our planet stood and then probably a couple of planets got too close to each other and one of them got tossed out usually the smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger one\nAnd in our case we think that that happened to planet nine but planet nine didn't get past quite far enough so now it's just hanging around on the outer edge but if if it had gotten a little bit closer to say Jupiter could have been completely ejected from our solar system\nIn which case it would just be wandering through space and so it is absolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's no question about it\nWhen people ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy theory that there is a giant planet that is going to destroy the earth\nThe bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy theory that there is a giant planet that's going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and\nThings like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracies stuff that actually makes no sense\nExplains for a general world audience why some the masses like a planet cannot sneak up on earth in the inner planets with out every astronomer on knowing\nIf something like ... I don't know what's the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally over to headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system\nUsually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize\nIf it were really coming it would be so bright that you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go look and see it coming you wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping it secret\nAnd you would have been visible to every backyard astronomer with the whole scope for the past decade and it would have been visible to every professional astronomer for the past fifty years if all of these people are in on the conspiracy\nI don't know anywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nIs something ten times the mass of our earth where even out how to do out in the ... what would be the obvious observation all changes perturbation in our solar system\nIn the inner part of our soldiers in an apartment in the planets that we know of planet nine has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets and you can figure out why it's ten we actually think more like seven o seven times the mass of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun and the earth is\nJupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is so Jupiter has a tremendous effect on the planets in the solar system and nobody sits around in his worried the Jupiter is certainly going to come destroy us\nPlanet nine is really far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter's so its effect it's really minimal one effect that it does have is that over four billion years it is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planet but\nEven that is just a very very minor effect\nIf you're going to Hawaii in November and maybe you'll be successful this time would it be possible to talk with you in December about what you might find or you have to wait to do papers for\nJust the way the process works is we'll go there in November will collect the data it'll take us several weeks to months to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so\nIf we have found what we're looking for we will know it within a month or two of collecting those data and then at that point will announce its existence as soon as we can confirm it we will have found it will go back to the telescope and double checked that it's really there\nAnd then will announce its existence right away so we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] January twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nIt's possible I'm always very optimistic Constantine fatigue and my partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it will take us another ten years I think it will take us one year\nSo maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\nSo there you have a Oregon right from that man is discovered this uh in terms of those ... of those half a dozen bodies that are all kind of gather together out where the guy prevail in the ... cloud in that area\nAnd I think one of the most important part of doing the research project with these scientists is that I have no confusion about the fact that if there was something massive\nThat we're trying to move in to our solar system what it's called the inner solar system\nFrom a mercury aside and mercury out to wear a now Neptune and Iran is our biggest Pluto or been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hype about that there's nothing they could be out\nComing this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity that that's the thing about gravity and math and I it it would have impact on every single thing and so\nThat's when we I would've loved those Zacharias itching to have been alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if he would have been able to convince him about that new bureau\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can start my own work that I had a discussion of the face eye to eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do it said that for conversations that end of it 'cause it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting\nThat ... even if\nHe doesn't agree in some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that that could be massive plan it but when you read like say about the ...

climate change Linda\nYeah you know with Thirty years ago and Nineteen eighty eight when the world with really kind of waking up seriously for the first time to global climate change\nAnd real potential dire consequences in the future if we didn't get on top of the expanding methane and carbon dioxide blanket around the earth\nAnd at the United nation many countries especially those worry about being Ireland and we see level rise could flood and\nDisplaced population they came together to form the inter governmental panel on climate change often known as the eye PCC and the objective was to provide data about earth changes on an ongoing basis\nTo help project some of these impacts on world politics and the economy\nBy twenty Fifteen only three years ago and the Paris Agreement on climate change\nMany small island nation were so worried about disappearing under ... rising sea levels that the I. T. C. C. committed they're doing a twenty Eighteen report written by night anyone scientists from forty countries\nThe question was hit humans to restrict global warming two degrees Celsius or one point five degrees Celsius below pre industrial levels\nThe October twenty Eighteen I ... the answer is stricter at one point five degrees Celsius equipment to point seven degrees Fahrenheit\nShould be the new target to achieve and hold in place by twenty thirty that's the only a decade from now\nBecause if we don't if I planet continues to warm up above that limit at one point five degrees Celsius\nScientists warn that will be a catastrophe of math die off they will accelerate and the coral reefs and if they die that kills off other marine species dependent upon the coral weather will become more violent and when flooding rains and devastating wildfires\nWeather extremes will cause famine and fighting over land food in freshwater\nAnd he level rise will force more and more island

in Washington which seems to pretend that this climate change threat does not exist\nBut this was widely knowledge in the defense community meaning the Pentagon as recently as three years ago in twenty Fifteen ... he is professor drew Shen down\nHe ate a professor of earth sciences in the earth and sciences division at Duke University and he joins us now from Durham North Carolina\nCould you please give me the top side places in the United states where water is coming in and flooding is already making people move\nI Would say those are Florida Alaska and around the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia and Louisiana so those would probably be the top of the United states\nAnd where it would be the five top nation in the world that are now Ireland and other places that are most impacted by sea level rise\nAround the world unfortunately all too many very low lying countries and that's a large part of why we have this new report those\nCountries want to the United nations to investigate lower warming target thinking that\nTwo degrees was probably not sufficient to protect them those are most of the islands in the south Pacific also ... and the Indian Ocean many Caribbean countries\nAnd then there are very low like countries like Bangladesh where the bulk of the population lives very close to sea level Nigeria has huge populated she read your she level but you know sodas most of the world and the United states also has enormous populations right at the coast\nAnd where in Alaska\nIn Alaska you have an interesting problem where it's it's one of the nation rising sea levels and melts the ice and the ice ...\nYou have an interesting problem where it's it's a combination of rising sea levels and melting ice and the ice protected shorelines from the waves from the ocean and without the ice\nWaiters can reach the shore and more easily and the waves are higher because of rising sea levels and so a lot of coastal communities along the west coast and the very straight area many of them are already\nHaving to be evacuated and moved to higher ground so it's not so much the north slope of the south and west coasts\nAnd who is paying for that\nI Believe that the combination of federal and state governments\nAlready moving people in Alaska from flooding to higher ground yeah\nAnd he is that happening in Louisiana Florida North Carolina as well\nThere has not been so much evacuation of the coast there's been more what\nUsed to be rare flooding events that are now becoming quite common so I think that there is likely to after the evacuation in the next couple decades of at least some places\nThere's an island in the ... peak for example between Maryland and Virginia more than half of it has already gone\nAnd we've seen the water come up through the drains skin to Charleston South Carolina and Virginia where nuisance flooding that went very rare as it comes so commonplace that government had to put a marker so that motorists can see how deep the flooding is it's so routine and Florida it's been some of the worst\nFlooding of street in the southeast part of the state\nHas become fairly routine as he level rise has continued and we've seen an acceleration because both the Greenland\nAnd Antarctica ice sheets are melting more rapidly than was expected just a decade to cope and dump more water into the ocean unfortunately what we've been seeing over the past several decades since we started to generate these projections from computer models\nAnd then watch the models has often been too conservative and things are happening faster than the models project\nCan you give an example of what has been dramatic compared to the computer model\nOne thing was the boss of sea ice in the Arctic it went like two or three times faster than the models project to\nYes the Arctic had melted two to three times faster than the computer's projected already by twenty Eighteen is that a harbinger of the fact that it's likely the warming and melting ice will keep increasing faster like what happened in the Arctic\nWell we've been observing from satellite but melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating\nSo that is definitely a worry\nIs extremely challenging problem to figure out exactly how this massive she might become destabilized based on say melting from the top with water slipping down through cracks in the ice sheet and lubricating the dead below\nYou know when we worry because the warming has been so fast in the Arctic that the acceleration will continue\nAnd we're speaking in October of twenty Eighteen what would you project we will be seeing more dramatic weather events between twenty Eighteen and twenty thirty\nLess rainfall in the west increasing water scarcity greater probability is drought greater likelihood of high fire conditions and receive flooding in the east as you get more extreme heavy rainfall events and the more heat waves everywhere around the country\nAll they talk about as Russia

that mean that what do they stupid they don't know history every single time you do this these people were overplayed apart every single time it causes a slowdown in the economy\nSo it it doesn't balance out you go too far take a step or two too far in one direction or another and it screws things up the death even though we may have a great economy is very delicate balance is very very delicate it there's so many moving parts and the trade situation is another uh is another part of it\nThat is a is that it's dangerous and so these people want to win the election next month and you look at the economic indicators they are good for the next two years so and that that will be if the if it goes down and two years from all never get reelected\nAnd I would think that would be on his mind to a point at any rate uh it's uh this is\nIt goes down and two years from all never get reelected\nAnd I would think that would be on his mind to a point\nAt any rate uh it's uh this is not a great situation for if the economy slows down\nIt just it doesn't bode well let me go back to that same business up and down unemployment is three or at least ... reported unemployment is three something percent so it's always twice the number of people out of work hours twice with the government says it is 'cause most people after they go through or whatever benefits they can get their unemployed\nThey just don't they just disappear or what else is the Trump stir doing outlining a new plan that aims to lower drug prices falling\nA new way for Medicare to negotiate and pay for certain drugs based on what other countries\nAre paying why hasn't this been done before would be the question why didn't the previous administration and all the hoopla about Obamacare why wouldn't that have been part of the thing that would benefit Americans or why Americans who pay and American or who uh get this stuff\nUm Trump said quote we're taking aim at the global free loading the forces American consumers to subsidize lower prices in foreign countries you know that we pay more here this is not from speaking this is me we pay more for drugs in this country than any other country and most of them are made here\nBy American companies\nRight into the American companies is growing the Americans and everybody else around the world pays less in some cases\n... oh All right this is where you where you win on both sides of the aisle because you're right the medicine is as it tells the drugs and everything it's just too expensive to thirty\nPercent they want to cut the price of by thirty percent of the next five years\nPresident also proposing changes to physician drug reimbursements for doctors would be paid a flat rate that having a monetary incentive to provide higher cost right I think it's outrageous that again any money at all ... from the drug companies that were kind of a deal is that\nSo anyway lowering prescription drug prices are the are that's an announcement made just in time for the midterm elections you can be sure there was political motivation to that but it's okay\nSo I mentioned Obamacare or that Trump's lawyers are trying to relax guidelines for states to opt out\nOf Obamacare new changes which are have been published this week states apply for a new expanded state relief and empowerment waivers Jennifer states could use the waiver to determine who gets financial assistance to pay premiums and to change the type of coverage\nThat a is a prioritized in the markets are I don't necessarily I don't understand a lot of this stuff frankly I don't understand why this is only a certain amount of time to change your provider under Medicare rules\nAnd uh I just I think that the whole thing whether it's Obamacare or other onerous rules or the whole policy is it's all meant to benefit the insurance companies and the drug companies and benefit\nYou why can't you change whatever you want to whether the artificial October and November or the times you can change your coverage why I Want to change my company's next June why can't I make any sense does it ... thank\nYou know it doesn't it's stupid it's a terrible system like you you could have said that anything that I was saying in a [laughter] a terrible system that respond to you now have you know sometimes I one more Trump stir focus at the opioid epidemic\nRemember
