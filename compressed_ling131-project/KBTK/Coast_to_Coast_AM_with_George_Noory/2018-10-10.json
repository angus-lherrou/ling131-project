around no um food now animals that I was by myself and\nI guess um I I've linked to know people that are tell a path that now you had that people are are usually good with meditation I haven't done a Letterman had meditation my life but I had been on my own a\nTremendous amount of time I'm at a deep thinker I'm spiritual and I think I'm an empathetic [laughter] so I wanted to know if the qualities allow people to be more\n... path again in addition for about twenty two years I've seen\nDouble and triple digit I'm On the clock on the email address is lay place and what not and that has become bigger and society at the time I didn't know what was going on and people didn't understand what I was trying to tell them but um\nI I kind of thinking that this might be a telecast experience as well\nSaying something like ... to on the clock\nI'm thinking of record that message it you know something important in your life seeing signs so I kinda think that it's all intertwined and then just one more thing I'm\nPulling out awhile ago someone had told me I'm In the spirit and the solar actually different I I Believe and maybe in five or some religions it's the body and mind here at all\nAnd so I kinda think that what you're saying is differentiating between me and it's like the spirit\nOr the other person is it's outside and the spirit inside [laughter] or either or but um I I kind of think of it on your level what you're saying as well\nI Would think more than ... maybe one in the say what do you think\nYeah thank you for your question on ... um I tend to agree with you George and there's an analogy I Love also from Dr Fernando Castro which summarizes the way I think about things which is to imagine reality as being like a stream of water where water represents consciousness\nAnd each of us is like a world pool within that stream so we're having a localized individual experience within the broader stream but we are fundamentally still made out of water so what happens when the physical body dies that's like a world full of dissipating and the water does that leave the stream it just transitions into a different state\nAnd so the water to me is consciousness and consciousness is having this variety of experiences whether a localized in a world full or otherwise in the stream\nDo you think the consciousness is a normal process of living or is supernatural\nThe way I view consciousness is that it's like max clump he said I regard consciousness as fundamental I regard matter as to rebut if from consciousness meaning that\nConsciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things points to that but I Do everything that we experience as being a basically a modulation that is happening within consciousness\nHow is this new knowledge for you more changed your life\nIt's changed it massively [laughter] so I alluded to this earlier that the material is perspective that I subscribe to a leads to a very bleak outlook on life once your brain's off it's over I mean I understood the implications of that and I think that's what our education system is teaching um now I think that\nConsciousness does not die when the body dies because it's the consciousness isn't dependent on the body so I see much more uh ... meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think I Wish this had been talk to me a long time ago but going back to the near death experiences\nWhat people often report is known as a life review where they experience their whole life in a flash and again this is one of their brain is either offer highly impaired and they're judging themselves for how they acted during their life\nBut this is the kicker that really I think about this every day is that some people report experiencing the life review through the eyes of those they affected so let's say Bob harm to change in his life and Bob is having a life review he might experienced the pain through James eyes\nAnd he comes back to his life forever changed carrying much more about uh how we treat people rather than material good so it when we talked about meeting in life the life review as a potential lens if we take that as a literal phenomenon about you know the purpose here is really to treat one another well\nDo you think in our life that we were given this gift to be able to do these incredible things to consciousness free cognition fill up to the ... and things like\nThat well yeah I I think that these are natural abilities that we tend to have and the telepathy study I mentioned earlier where people are thirty two percent rather than twenty five percent there's a subtle ability even people in people who aren't trained\nI think there are abilities that are just simply not harness in modern society because these ideas are considered a novelist and totally paranormal and this is one of the reasons I wanted to write the book itself so compelled to do it is that\nAn understanding human potential and these abilities that we have could revolutionize I think the world but also our science in our medicine if we understood how to incorporate them into what we do\nFirst time caller John in Flint, Michigan welcome to the show John go ahead\nYou doing sir great I'm an ex military and I will tell you I don't believe in ghost UFOs and everything

it sounds odd but uh you spoke broken English I Believe he was ... Israeli descent from what I can get up who like dealt with over there mhm\nMy question is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in the remote viewing the costs\nUh I guess association with nationality\nIs there any research or anything where\nThere's a culture or a nationality that is more than ... ... you are\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there are ... there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\n\nI Would say that consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being researched widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there are certain brain configuration that make people more able for duty thanks\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something where the mind around\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has ... outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the world for an allergy it's like somebody is able to act another target the stream even though there are localized in their individual world it's like they open up their ... and they accept water that's outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us Yes sir\nI ... so you do or you you believe in remote viewing but it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nBarn unfortunately it with me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I uh [noise] a lot of things that I that was I including those sightings and everything else I've been able to do something else\nThank you rich we have indisputable through for the power of carnivores from nature\nThis double blind study is being peer reviewed in an international journals and there was also the study Seventy five percent of the cats no longer showed any signs of their immune condition\nThis is big news folks the forthcoming study will include cats and dogs to governments shortly we'd like to think that the Michael lapping DV him for his amazing assistance in putting this altogether\nWe are also looking forward to the study with people in the United states\nNow that's carnivores Carr C.

can we conclude that consciousness is a part of the universe always was\nIn that it survives outside of the physical brain the physical body but it's there it's out there in the ether I mean can we categorically all agree on that\nTo me the evidence points in that direction more strongly than any other direction when you put together a phenomenon that we discussed night\nA psychic phenomena like ... the cycle can use this pre cognition near death experiences children with half like memories when you put all these together combined with certain phenomena of quantum physics\nIt's they get that consciousness is playing the fundamental role in the universe beyond space and time\nWe've got George in Corpus Christi Texas now hey George welcome to the bird ...\nGeorge ah may God Bless you and your show in the bus and\nThinking it was wonderful really wonderful\nAnd my uh my question is do you ever got out of the callers are if reincarnation as a result of consciousness living outside the body and each of us and the so AKA consciousness\nMoves on the effect another human being good or evil out just free will play a part in or effect consciousness and I'll take my reply on the right\nTo free will have anything to do with a mark\nThis is a very tricky question I think the question of free will ultimately boils down to who is the agent that we're speaking of that has the free well um are we talking about the body having free will are we talking about the consciousness it's self\nAnd if we think of consciousness as being like the stream of water than all there is conscious so at the level of the fundamental consciousness it would appear that there is a infinite priests\nBut at the level of perhaps ... an individual that is\nConsidering itself to be separated from that consciousness or at least appearing that way than perhaps the free world does not exist at the same level that that makes sense\nYeah it does ... ... on a very difficult subject\nIt's very difficult and I think there are some of the concept that we're talking about night I think are beyond what what are linear human mind can't conceptualize sort of like insanity we all know insanity exist but we can we really understand what it means I think there are certain concepts that our brains just limit of trauma understanding falling\nYou'd think somebody like Jesus understood the ability of consciousness and da da da da da da da and the ...\nI I think there were probably people throughout history um who really understood the nature of reality and I don't know the details of how Jesus might've interplay with consciousness but from the bits and pieces I I've heard it's possible that he was one of these individuals\nWho really understood how things work and it seems when one understands reality perhaps we can do things that seem totally paranormal but again they're not paranormal under this alternative framework\nWe have a guest his name's Joe ... a gallon burger and he's a he's a professor and he's conducted experiments in Las Vegas one of his books is called liquid luck he has concluded beyond a shadow of the doubt\nThat the ability of the mind and attitude will determine whether you win or lose in his studies in Las Vegas where he's tested and in and he said it's uncanny suing somebody goes in the Las Vegas upbeat positive\nUh there's a high likelihood they're going to win but if they go in we're going to lose this isn't going to happen they're going to lose and and he said the results are on candy\nI think that's all tied together like consciousness it's all part of the same don't you\nI'm not familiar with those exact studies but I'm very open to the idea for the reason that you just stay out of consciousness is the basis of reality where everything is just the stream of consciousness then the reality we're in is almost malleable\nAnd sometimes it's very subtle where you have a random number generator that's behaving slightly non randomly in other cases we have reports like he talked about of metal being that using the mind\nSo who's to say that outcomes which is just a a part of the physical reality could also be affected by the way our consciousness is acting\nEast of the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James waiting for a cello James\n... Ah yes real quickly before oh make my statement\nI like the uh respect of this disagree with a that aids is a view about the effects of a drug distortion the on the mind or you know it's an indicator that consciousness is a product of the mind ...\nI'm a you know as you the\nPerson to speak to him into a tape recorder as an example\nUm you know if that example would be a consciousness\nAnd uh the play back of this tape recorded a you know if the typing wrinkles clinical those something will end up playing it just started a voice or you know distortions that would be an example of the drugs mine\nYou know it's not the consciousness but that's the effect of the apparatus there's I'm\nBringing about a distortion\nOf what consciousness put in it so it's not coming out in this to clarity that's you know the wholesome of consciousness that went to is [noise] uh but anyway uh uh I think the prime example of a\nA spirit living outside of the body is death to self when you have a Gulf hunting so you have a example of active consciousness uh this ... this thing outside of the body that I'm able to live with paid have knowledge of events that you know maybe it shouldn't\nUh otherwise a telescope nieces and everything else I think that's the prime example of consciousness uh outside of the body right there\nWhen you think of them are\nWell there are studies using on mediums people who can communicate with the deceased is related to what James was just describing and they're actually controlled studies that have been done at the wind ... Research Center and these studies are use five levels of blinding where the media and the person who allegedly can communicate with the deceased\nIs speaking on the phone to the researcher and all that person knows is the first name of the dead person and they're able to bring in non chance information and there have been to peer reviewed journal studies on this they just think that the mediums are able to obtain information we need more research on it but that's an example of\nSomeone who appears to be deceased and a living person getting information about someone who is deceased\nWhere do you think of some mediums do you think some of them are very effective\nAt erasing an important point I think there is a tendency um I think in the mainstream to say that there are frauds out there that are claimed to be mediums and maybe there are some fraud I think there are some people that\nHave real abilities and the wind ...

he always works really hard at what he does and you know he believes and\nHelping people so that to me makes a huge difference and it's not just you know all about me all about money it's all about how you're going to serve and help other\nWhen you run an investigation do you go over to quit mid to the number of people\nYes yeah there is a team on over the years that team has changed and has grown and we have a you know few mediums at work with us um we have people that work specialize on the electronics they work with the ... meters\nOn you know we have those that use the quarter is and I think it's just a good team of people that have worked together for so long\nAnd just have a routine down\nHave you ever been on an investigation Maureen were you what we do a lot of this thing you know no\nMore than once really [laughter]\nYeah there's there's been a couple um there's there's been a few and when those moments happen there even though they're rare they're still unnerved me you know I mean one let's say well I'm not afraid of anything that you know he'll say but to me\nYou know you have to just keep aware and uh I don't intend to feel the effects of an investigation let's say over a period of time as no joy if it's taking energy for me if it's feeling you know I'm literally like I have a pain in my chest or I'm feeling all this uh\nYou know after effect let's say um I still have to work a day job so it could interfere and that's one thing I always have to kind of be aware of\nWhat would you say has been the most fascinating to shoot them on\nTo date\nOh jeez fascinating um to me we investigated the Portsmouth White House\nUm one time and there was a the last White House keepers wife Connie small I Believe what's her name and to me it was fascinating because this was the sweetest woman that had come through I felt for energy and it was nice for a change you know so I wasn't\nI wasn't in fear for feeling um painter having any ill effects\nAnd it just was a pleasant feeling and what was even nicer it was\nAfter we were done and I was investigating how she came through she was so excited she I channeled turf felt like she just was so excited to be alive again so she could talk to the people around her but to me what really it was fascinating was you know we investigate and a lot of times it's you know ...\nCentury afraid that you're dealing with so you don't necessarily see the person face to face that you can overcome you know communicated with\n'em and so we had done a talk after this investigation um and once we did that time you know here's this woman ... small her picture as life size in front of me and I just I didn't expect it but I literally just broke down because it was again the first time I got to really see a woman I just felt a connection to her that I just couldn't\nExplain no that's kinda that's got to be emotional sometimes when you see things like that and I bet when you were in the ... you know you look at the gravestone did you actually think you know here's a person who died and\nYou know means or right here in New Hampshire grossly operations attached to that that's got to be emotional for people did you ever have you ever just broken down\n\nA you know I've broken down on while I Try not to break down but when I've done readings for people um you know and I've actually\nYou know you talk about the loved ones you talk about I mean these are real people you're talking about you know their pains and SARS and it doesn't help them really to break down but you can't help it sometimes because if you're a compassionate and you have a hard it's hard not to\nUm as much as you probably try to try to stay focused\nKnow you get involved in these things\nYou do definitely do you can put yourself in their place and and realize that you know our own you know mortality right so it's ... ... you come face to face with dealing with death on many occasions\nMoney it can be hot baking\nWhat would you say is the strangest to shoot come across strangers\nStrangers case okay well when Ron would take me out to investigate many times and just about all the time he would never tell me where we were going on because it's the keep me honest right so\nI'm not Googling my information and they were for\n'em so one day he gave me a call and say hey marine you know I have this case it's ten in the morning you know can you come with me it's really only take us in our\nYou know ha ha ha so yeah exactly I'm sure are on\nYou know he's very creative right so I said\nOh okay you know I guess I can go for a couple of hours so we'd go to this home it's just you know little ranch style house and we we get there and there's this you know men two guys they're one of they just look really rough and tumble is you know and this one guy you know like run I think his name was moose and the\nBig big guy covered in tattoos and we just tried it you know just\nOverwhelming right to sit there and so it was just looking at me and we get in this house and he said I think I have a little girl in here spirit and you look around and the mayor is a shattered glass table from busted and it just looked like someone went through the house with a bat\nUm it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know they've my phone's been ringing with all heroes on it and my wallet went missing and you know he's telling me all these things and he kept saying I think it's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see what we can pick up\nSo after a few minutes I'm thinking oh my God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know a spirit of a man very angry I'm very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this is a man no it's not and he was getting adamant that you know it wasn't and I need to talk to\nYou and brings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right um\nHe leaves want up at the top of the driveway with the guy news any dragged me down on the on the driveway and he looks and he said I Want you come back here tonight by yourself and I said well you know I really don't feel it's a little girl and you got to be careful you know you don't want to welcome is\nSomething that you don't know is there and and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering\nFind out if you're already a victim

the New England ghost project with a degree in environmental science now he was\nA skeptic however a near death experience changed all that for him no longer blinded by his skepticism uses scientific

dot com and also his co written books with Maureen the ones I've told told you about more ghost chronicles and ghost a day welcome Ron good to talk with you\nIt morning looking forward to this so tell me about this near death experience\nYeah everybody wants to hear about that I think that's the funniest thing because ah it ... I had cut my ah fingers off on a table saw and ouch\nYeah well you know anyways uh I went to the hospital and they looked at it and they really couldn't do anything at that time\nSo they can to wrap them up and nice and and kept me an emergency room to they can bring a specialist and six and a half hours later they put them all back together and ah\nYou know that was fine but during the night um I got that came up to see me and she realized something was wrong even though I I I thought I felt fine and she called for a CAT scan actually had to bring the the woman in hospitals nobody at that time and they realized they had a blueberry embolism\nAnd from then on things began to have a well this is all going on I had what I Believe was a near death experience and it's not like the\nThe usual and gee here and and that's it was I was just basically in a different place it was extremely bright white I guess it's the best way to describe it and ah they were uh\nPeople their figures anyways I couldn't really see any features or anything but they also white and the [noise]\nThe weird thing about it is also there was what I thought was it sounds really ... enjoy music it had that\nMhm same type thing and ah also felt a and there's a line in the ... like a prayer that I always quote that is it felt like home with a very comfortable it was very warm\nAnd then the whole thing just be disappeared like the closing of an Irish and it was the law that break with us and it was just the duck or\nAh ICU that it was and there was no music was just my hot you know in the morning\nIt was nobody around and certainly wasn't a warm so I when I got a hospital I didn't know if it was a true experience or was it just the drugs they gave me so that's how I got I got into the paranormal\nWhen did you conclude that ah it wasn't just the drawings that there was something really unusual going on here for you\nYou know it's something you you just have to um what's the word I'm looking for ...\n... they're really either believe it or not and uh\nSo I Know that I had this experience can I tell you it is absolutely a ... that the experience you know can absolutely tell you it wasn't no so it's one of those mystery that that pushes me to the other things that I Do\nDo they re attached the fingers were they able to do yeah\nYeah well oddly enough and uh I'm going to cut off I cut\nThe the middle one all on my left in the middle and totally off the the um next to it I had several places that was a kind of dangling the top of the fun I head\nCut off completely uh they actually put a ... when they put together a mental thing and so if I ever given by the finger I always tell them it's not me [laughter] 'cause it's possess ask about\nIt that was a joke [laughter] ha ha ha it's three thirty in the morning it's good but she'll she'll the hand works normally yes it's amazing guide yup\nIt's a ... what the time it's it's a little difficult with the cold but ah yeah it's really\nNot tell us about the New England goes project that you started what the what is that\nA ... was for um probably about Twenty years ago when I get a hospital\nA media one was often a course in TV production at the time because my hand was on the couch and it was all kinds of blunt than us and things so\nIt looked interesting it was a thorough cause but I'm not up to complete it you had to do it on a a\nShow on something and I spend all have this near death experience I don't know if it was the drugs they gave me a lot and also I own a manufacturing company in manufacturing company it was supposed to be haunted by people that weren't there and uh you know that hurts all kinds of [noise]\nAnd it was I in number so I said you know what I got to do it all goes as a lock\nAnd uh that's how it all started I went on my first ... TV show slash investigation and ah I realized that were a lot of things even though I have a good science background that I couldn't explain and I was curious and were curious I got the more I did it and eventually I began to doing it full time\nAnd you love and I do because they still not sure of all the things that happen what's real and what's not\nSo you got a degree in environmental science\nYeah you're on the moon program as well\nWho are interested in the ... you were a skeptic but now you're a believer you've made this full circle how far are you on the other side that you believe is\nYou know I Believe there's something out here I Believe in an afterlife do I believe that everything icy\nAnd and it's you know always skeptical bite my science spring I guess you want to call it a or my grounding brain always you know makes me out what's going on and I've had a lot of unique experiences but or is it enough there that I Know that the experiences happened but\nAre they really paranormal or rather than you know something else mentioned nation or something I just can't explain\nWhat keeps trying to you why do you keep doing this\nOh\nThere's a lot of reasons the the primaries is to try to understand it more I Try to understand all aspects of the power level just like going in as a you know\nWell to give you an idea a when I first started doing this I thought that all mediums shower things like a gypsy zip to the beach doing fourteen telling and uh when I met Bahrain I was pretty much the same category but I figured it couldn't hurt\nTo at least a try to understand what they are and who they are and what they do\nAnd uh so that's kinda my whoa aspects of what I Do even if I don't believe in anything I'm always open minded enough to at least try to understand if I'm going to criticize it I got to know as much as I can about it to do that so that's kinda\nHow a a more open minded but still it got that heavy skepticism\nWhat do you think of her abilities as as a medium\nHe had a marinas is very unique and you know there are a lot of mediums out there and\nBut uh woodworking with her as she comes up with some amazing stuff in in a trance channel courses stills skills the crap out of most people who see it so uh yeah I you know I definitely she believes she has some type of ability\nYou run across a lot of people like her in what you do\nBut I guess you know you spent ...\nMedium lots of mediums lots of them yeah I mean and\nWe you know I also do a lot of studies for instance the physical medium ship is it's something that's
