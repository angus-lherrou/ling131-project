before\nHalloween that is our focus for both tonight and tomorrow night when I'll be hosting coast to coast again coming up tomorrow night looking forward to a season with the which\nIt's a in our first hour we'll talk about uh about Salem, Massachusetts again because we had a great show but\nAbout witchcraft in Salem a couple of months ago but in this case uh we'll be talking about in regard to Halloween and some of the festivities that will be taking place and uh and then also the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nAbout the scariest story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true\nAnd also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James who some of you better know as a sportswriter he writes ah he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the ... he was not in he's not in LA tonight\n... originally we had him scheduled a Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out he wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to finish in after all which is great because in the tradition of like\nYou know Freddie and Jason and Michael and all of the Halloween stuff um it's a creepy story and you're going to want to hear it coming up tomorrow night on coast to coast but it won't be any better than tonight will do open lines later on we'll say some of the subjects will get to\nTime ago and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... one of the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their actions and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the key to the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut you do you how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to load\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and and you indicated about of the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's\nReally about what's going on right here in right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world uh I tell for example the story of Iran must are being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nGot a finger in this whole neural net a business that says the really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine that's because we're already doing it with mice and in in the very near future um you know it it's pretty certain that we are going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net think of it I think\nOf it as a fisherman that so you injected into the brain cavity of a mouse\nAnd when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain and then kind of a integrate itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this girl and that has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it\nAnd the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which I'm we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so\nOne of the things that have on mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that's that's even better\nBut one of the one of the things that you know on mosque foreseen is the day when we ... we have to use the one of these and our own that\nWe can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't\nNeed a keyboard or anything like that so I think that is the beginning\nOf the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts\nAre memories are in code them digitally of it's not at all farfetched anymore once you have that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon and so you talk about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like\nWhoa [laughter] way way out there right and so it could easily easily a whole\nYou know it's not just the ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots or because\nYou can hold on a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistic\nWe can talk about that tonight he will I I think that's the way to go not cryogenic\nCryogenic is a kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it it will be but I think the other technologies are much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know and so and I'm not going to try and partially what you said you must have been a a\nI think it's fair to say this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward is when we use terms like thinking about doing or you know beginning\nOf the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when I see the future\nBecause what we can do now is the frontier but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically that's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because\nYou know if we if we take our science fiction movies seriously then we're often reminded that starts off as a really good idea\nTo go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\nYou think you think yeah absolutely oh no absolutely\nAnd and you're right there this book deals with\nWe're right at the cost in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes city and for some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies Rhett are are kind of one foot in the present and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right you know if it enables us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about pie in the sky want you know the sweet bind by one day now these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about\nHey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality in any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have a ... that we are creating these are incredible robots artificial intelligence and we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing is\nThe near future but it is it's it's enabling right now it's it's crazy\nWell and so I'm reminded of the ... the ... song um which I I inevitably come back to an subject like this um history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla and ... and the the the\nI think this is where I'm sort of curious about your approaching this because this book is published by a publishing company which is known for being the the east and and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book that even as you get into there's a larger discussion of\nNot just doing things because we can but because we should do and the officer really important in there too so you know just because we're on the threshold of doing something on we do that and ... who how are we going to make a decision\nOn the implications of when we decide yep this is we're going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I I have to give them credit it was their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history because of the lessons it teaches us about\nWhat we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise]\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you can uh reporting science all your life and I've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it\nAnd then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about this that I Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I describe\nOur perfect based in their ... it's just like you know the old\nDragnet series you know the facts ma'am right Andrew ... that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand foot notes if you can imagine\nOh no I've read through to you you're very very thorough yeah\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final\nChapter and I thought you know I Can't just serve this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so here here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um\nI see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence that really spectacular many of them are really in\nA lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this\nBut then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous what I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim\nOr great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA\nWith the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics math and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be an\nExport into wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and [laughter] and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life\nAnd she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I thought like the Bible is not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it it's so I have become a man of\nFaith faith I'm a Christian and I take my ... my face very very seriously and so when I say we\nAt eight hundred six eight three forty five forty six eight hundred six eight three forty five forty six eight hundred sixty three forty five forty six more stimulating\nOn air and online a big talker radio dot com Ninety seven point one the big talker pastor Kim Masters destined to win Sunday mornings at a Ninety seven\nPoints learning a former science reporter for a vote on the news on\nVarious shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is uh is this is great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of\nWhat we should didn't want to do which might be better informed by discussions of\nMorality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life on this planet is like ... whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that makes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate what's the end used for that um other than our own human vanity that we've become immortal\n[noise] yeah I agree with you in and uh I think on another concern or in addition to that is that\nA lot of the technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive\nUm you know never mind trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let let's talk about some of the technology that is being used to let say a I'm a help treat macular degeneration I'm going to just pick that as an example\nThere that's a good way in California right as a company in California\nThat is um marketing a retinal implants are people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff cause you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policy so a lot of this technology that that ... aims at improving our how Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving immortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people at least\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often talk about and science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know\nThat we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now it's for people who have been kind of disenfranchised um are marginalized by this technology will just get fed up at some point and say you know there's enough is enough I mean we're we're taking it and we're taking\nIt as a behind and and and and and we're not going to we're not gonna take it anymore and so ... and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ring or I Know you talk like that to the people in Salem no use that kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know [laughter]\nYeah well I figured it's a late night show so\nI'm trying to lay down on that one okay asleep\nBut you know never my regular yeah I got to worry about my wife you know tied that white you said watch out but uh\n[laughter] but um but I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these what they're calling bug out houses\nRent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world on the chance that you know when the stuff hits the fan there I go again but one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape or this is a serious thing I Hope some\nI quote former Google engineers and a Google executive uh and and others who say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay been hanged goes ... ... ... ... ... ... ... because yes the idea of having a bug out house right\nYeah that's like I mean every every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has a has that philosophies\nRight is it ... to ... yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that belief that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point I\nI'm worth thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know of what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance\nRight they're done they they they they they ... that was there a moment and the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nIs and the and the notion to that for example when you talk about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral or leads any way we could\nYou know a ... quantify society hit the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them and then if that becomes the ... the class that's perpetuated I Would say again\nSome of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them and then if that becomes the ... the clash that's perpetuated\nI Would say again they had their chance to do it has to there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else is going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from issue well time machine right\nMhm yes yes yes yeah no it it it's interesting or by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum once this is just a funny aside when\nIn fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and I had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere in the ... at the after party and Jeff bloom was there and\nA bunch of other guys and I went up to ... I said Jeff you know you're always like playing a scientist or not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I said sure\nI I'm just curious I said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up or what he just not just a job and you know he has all this appointed and his answer I thought he was gonna say oh yeah you know I majored in\nPhysics at college right now you know [laughter] but no job for him but yeah it ... I I I Love you bringing that up in the dinosaurs had their chance\nIt's really an indication of how the earth how the world works how the universe works\nAre designed to work is designed to work exactly yeah and\nYou know or you know you're somebody's religious beliefs aside for a moment let's just talk like strictly science\nSure um ... what what were you learn is that uh these species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's a meteor or whether it's a\nA temperature change or or it's a a rampant disease that and then I mean you know like the woolly mammoth saber tooth\nCats and so forth and so on and the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book you can't help but wonder\nWhy are we doing here and then I think of what Arthur C Clark one set and it stuck with me he said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\n[laughter] I don't know why\nYou know and you wonder are we like\nOutsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just being too clever by a half\nWith a staff thinking that you know we're going to improve life the are going to improve the human condition and in fact\nJust the opposite happens we do ourselves in I mean that's a real possibility and and and you think of Jeff Goldblum said they had their chance maybe some some creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance\nNow he blew it well now\nAnd now here's an inch now let me ... is a little differently if there was a ... humans killed off species they didn't die out no actually they were killed off\nOpposed to say evolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow their evolutionary cycle that was\nTruncated right by you know the fact that they you know some giant bird and New Zealand lead these really big exit you know human could eat off for three days and so um you know there's going so I mean I I realize you could make a Darwinian argument for that but I think there are some\nSpecies like some like some bare earth some tiger whenever that if we cloned that Darren brought him back in ... introduced it to the wild not enough time has passed\nThat he couldn't read absorbed that back into the the natural flow of our evolutionary cycles\nWere you sip recruiter learns what you're looking for identifies people with the right experience and invites them to apply\nTo your job these invitations have revolutionized how you find your next tier in fact eighty percent of employers to post a job ... get a quality candidate through the site in just one\nDay and separate or doesn't stop there they've been spotlight the strongest applications you received\nSo you'll never missed a great match the right candidates are out there the zipper critter is how you find them zip recruiter the smartest way to hire just go to zip recruiter dot com slash Dave in my listeners can post jobs on the zip recruiter for free that's ripe\nFree that's the zip recruiter dot com ...\nStudy seven point one of the big soccer is KBC K Katrina village Flagstaff press getting Ninety seven point one the big talk to her more stimulating talk\n\nWhat you're breaking the walk off love jak hell and Fox News the longest game in the world series history I think just a few minutes ago and dramatic fashion [noise]\nJoe Buck with a call on Fox ... months he's Homer coming seven hours twenty minutes after the game started making the Dodgers three to two winners Red Sox still leave the world series two games to one game for later tonight in LA the FBI says the fourteen devices meld all leading Democrats this week we're potentially working bombs\nThan suspected of sending them metal in custody\nA latent fingerprint from a package into California congresswoman Maxine Waters plus other DNA evidence help police identify things are say active fifty six year old Florida resident accused of sending more than a dozen dangerous packages to former President Obama Hillary Clinton and other high profile Democrats\nNow we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nFBI Director Christopher Wray says the packages each contains six inches of PVC pipe ...

some getting back you know back in may\nA coast to coast published and a picture of a police force that washed up on the beach of Georgia will reach I Believe it was and the scientists claimed that it was ... decompose body of basking shark now check out a Baskin sharp a totally different you know a messy\nDoesn't have ... doesn't have a dorsal fin it has a very small mouth um [noise]\nUh so you know we're being led astray there now I I don't remember for a number of things that I don't want to pick up a lot of your time I'd regarding the car about the mortality\nOf revelation nine [laughter] oh John the regulator was referring into the future two thousand years to the zombie chip and if you go to science daily dot com it's none of on a chip platform makes neural prosthesis more effective\nAnd go to Tom ... book mail you that welcome to the trans human resistance\nSo there's a number of things going out to her and I want to leave you with this you know the Alexis though the gal that answers the phone you know and you can ask for any kind of question you want you to have the answer right\nThere [noise] well I'm a\nPerson asked her well how do you think Jesus was on her response was a fictional person but then ask coop Mohamed was and there was a famous religious leader hey garbage in garbage out buddy\nYou know a very interesting things I hadn't heard that about a Alaskan Alexis but and that's how they programmed or to to say that there's of course wrong and and not accurate or not just wrong but historically there was obviously and I think even people\nWho are atheists who study the subject come to the conclusion by and large that he was a historical figure a as was\nMuhammad but that that's crazy and I hope they fixed that I that sounds like something that they would do in Silicon valley though doesn't it\nUh let me go to um\nMarry who's in New Jersey and coast to coast am married\nAround how are you tonight I'm going back to your guest I'm getting ... people\nYou know Mary around how are you tonight I'm going back to your guest um\n... people get the cutting edge I possibly that's\nWell that's a great question the ghost in the machine\nThat can run by the end of ... that's ...\nYeah that's an interesting idea I I Would think possession you know generally we talk about possession of the soul so if it if it's just a a machine you know complicated hammer um it would have no soul than it could occupy but then again you talked to other people who say that in adamant objects\nYou know become the uh uh the resting place or the attach meant\nPlace for you know a spirit just from that will are unwilling to leave an area and so they become attached to a thing so maybe not in sold as we would say like there's an instrument possession but who knows\nYou know that's what led coast to coast you all are always bringing up [laughter] never thought to Paula is in Omaha on coast to coast go ahead Paula\nYeah I'm a\nI remember when you're on the drama and what was my drama\nUm [noise] yeah that's\nRight so that was the right now my tonight is yeah when I began\nAnyway anyway um there are people out there that are in this world that really loud\nAnd I really really really like and I think you have any rain when our al ...\nCame out two weeks I Walk around [noise] and I I ... I mean on Saturday when I get ...\nOur email yeah sounds day in time can you keep ... ...\n... people that are so beautiful and so wonderful world literature and it just kills\nMe in a way I think you're one\nWell you're very sweet and I agree with you and I think that morning period after art I think it was just it just even though\nMany people were anticipating this complication was going to get worse\nI think he is you know if you'll pardon the expression I think we all you know lost their breath over then we just just just cut us off guard so yeah and I'm Sorry and I I Know that I think I think you have you with us\nHighway ... and this and say oh quick\nWater right past [noise] you know cool\nToy and I grew up and I you know\nI grew up around radio stations ... nurse yeah [laughter] ...\nNever did that start track that oh I have a nap\nAnd get paired when I get this kid\nThey said oh my God this\nWell it's nice to chat with you I tell me real quickly um so what kind of see what station did your father worked for\nA while he don't Cape deal Iran\nAnd pat ... and they were where oh wow I Know I think\nHe's much simply should I Would like to I was like to hear it take you God Bless you have a great night I I've always worked I'm not that technically advance I mean I can handle the little one and probably two oh one of any class about\nEngineering and something like that but I Love the engineers they really know the stuff\nThat's really cool they could just builds up to not enough and I'm All right so that brings me to oh Keith from Virginia is back\nSo she had called um when we were talking with our guest last hour and it seemed much more appropriate to have him on here for open lines so I'm Glad you called back so you you had a friend who it was you were telling the story about how it is the surgeon had essentially experience to kind is\nAlmost like a scientific revolution but it came into almost sort of divinely delivered where he suddenly knew exactly what to do in this complicated surgery do I get that right\nOh that's correct because I understand that and um that individual by the way and and uh thanks for having to get back on and sorry for not being a little bit quicker smoother with everything but um somebody very topics he discussed and and they are related to some of the things I wanted to say\nToo but sure this gentleman Dr wrestling now and uh also had a a he\nRelates to experience that of a failure or twice in surgery in which his patients died\nAnd they were children and they later many years later a visited him from the spirit world and delivered a message for him to give to\nTheir parents and title anyway this individual by the way is the same time I'm now from that in a at the age of Ninety three\nAfter having been a possible for the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints having left is world renowned medical career a became credit of the church in January of this year at the age of Ninety three\nAnd a an amazing man even a damn downhill skier at that age\nAnd um [noise] anyhow um what I wanted to get to was a I mentioned before a couple of things regarding astronomy and some other things in which\nThings revealed by the prophet jazz gave a little bit of Oregon hiding from time to time I hear things on the coast to coast am that there can be perhaps a connecting and for ... informed at length about paranormal and things from traditional Judeo Christian\nTeaching a that we find them and also in the Bible and and and that is a lot of the things that Joseph ... revealed or haven't revealed to him I should say by a Jesus Christ and many other this or that he had\nProfits and he brought about a lot of\nNew scripture hatred scripture as well as new scripture [noise]\nYeah and and we're going to get about thirty more seconds here so go ahead I said\nBasically to wrap it up the turtle man is one concept that he spoke about and he taught about and\nI wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned that recently by trim and maps and there's a very good Youtube video Joseph Smith and the recovery of eternal man because a lot of those principles seem to than Boston by you know the\nGoes [noise] well I'm I'm a guy's\nOh so so many not means somebody playing a little game like when you look at me\nLike I'm Out here every now and then you know and I'm going to turn around and see that\nThey want it all depends you correctly and and the and the jar container so they're all facing out towards a horse\nWhen it comes to get there it would just have their own fan right there\nYet but the thing of the the moving of the ... I mean it really is it's an amazing video in it for people that don't believe in in goes I think you'll enjoy it um but the scissors in depends who the ... in this little cup holder district moving around\nAnd this is it's not I mean you could almost make an argument like maybe the jar\nWas on a slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh but I I don't get the thing with the the pencils in the in the desert so yeah benevolent pulls you guys so I'll go with that until it got\nAny other theory to a a back it up Michelle is in Wyoming on coast to coast Michelle\nOur high fencing and I'm Sorry I'm a truck driver and I like all\nThe first things first the first things first if I can put you on hold and come back in a minute but that's easier\nI Know I can talk right now for a second look at all I'm a first time caller longtime listener and nice to have you when I was\nWondering why it's like I was raised Catholic and then like I chose to kind of walk away from that and explore other options and other things out there because\nYou know I just I don't know that that's the way I have inside an inherent gaffe maker I'm Carson when he first got on he was talking about that you know that scientific side of him and and\nThe thing that lady\nCome on and read the Bible and now it's sort of changed his mind on it and it's a Christian so what I was wondering and I don't have a very strong religious stuff exactly but I'm\nA little bit like I ... I Wonder how often\nWhen I'm driving down the road and how they can trust the authenticity of the Bible because you know I've often heard that a lot of the major story from it like the story of the ... and the story of a you know like I said\nYou're a hero type figure the grind of American and stuff those steroids can be found in like ... that the call ... ... ... talk for like ... and ... you know whatever creates the Bible so\nTalking about the you're talking about guilt ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels\nIn the in the guild diminish narratives should the news story [noise]\nUm and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of man God or ... that was birthed by a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is just another version of that\nSo the question to me always is not this to me and this is where I think a lot of it in my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up because I'm not going I'm not\nTrusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust the Bible because of how many true ... it has in it\n[noise] okay there's a there's a difference to me and there are true that we know to be\nA worse steering by right there there you you can count you can count on these troops that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good to you you still have to be good to them because it only makes us is Jewish worse\nYou know and so there are ... and and a lot of these stories to tell the truth the actual facts of these stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be on survivor\nThey'll let you know story that can be found in other places and then we can still try to find like the other information on the ...\nWell no here I Would say though is that even some of those other stories there are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who win Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago or ... other people started in ... like I'm\nEmphasizing something from their tradition saying she were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote\nThe things that they said had pre existed that story whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof about that there isn't in the Egyptians there's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but it in the end does it matter I mean it it do you can you do live your life better\nDoes it improve your life that's\nAnd that but but ... in the end does it matter I mean it it do you can you do you live your life better\nDoes it improve your life that's the question and I think getting hung up on worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science there's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be looking at not I don't think I'm ... and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them\nEvery day how companies they're going to listen to my best answer for you I Hope it gives you something to chew over while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of gas and\nIt's a long time out here to things now [laughter]\nAnd it will be ... be a you know you're a bad man the gym and you get where you're going well and thank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad your was your first time and I got to be there with you\nUm I go to a adjusted who's in Texas on coast to coast Justin\nHey buddy hey hey it's nice to be on man\nListen that river river actually called in or you can only take it to the left everybody's on the the religious aspect but or do whatever you want to get to some more scientific stuff yeah sure I'm not sure if a lot of people\nCarpet on mosque interview or he had with Joe Rogan and\nWhen he smoked ...\nYeah they're they're I think there are a little out there but I think somebody is uh that make logically advanced in the mind and has the means to do a lot pretty impactful when he says things about like a a guy in a magnetic augmentation and stuff\nAnd uh I really thought it was a neat metaphor they use than how human beings are pretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around you know we have the ability to do these massive computations and access to any kind of data that we had that we want\nAnd all that and he said that you know in the very\nNear future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free\nYou know and uh you know what would that do maybe to the educational system would we go to school for me just take philosophy classes to learn how to think properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those I think we need more than you know I think I think I think I think philosophy would be we treat ... ... yeah I think we treat philosophy is some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built in ...\nIt's just a fine arts credit that people just take\nJust absolutely right because it gives it and if it's not that it's dance you know or something so at night and dance at least in philosophy you don't have to go [laughter]\nBut you know to your point on on ... I'm a big believer in uh in his technological ... solutions on big big unseen ability um\nUh the Joe Rogan interview is troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed\nYou know his mental state from over working and not sleeping enough and et cetera I I think that review much more of the humanness which we don't we tend to think of most of the lung must be some big giant slot machine\nYes some big empty whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be a slightly unstable human being these days I own\nGeniuses are you know I and then everybody that that's a very intellectual always have some kind of inner struggle\nRight and so I'm a I I'm an investor actually in a very small am in a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after the Joe Rogan interview and uh and has recovered mostly as well but when\nA day or something like that one effect stocks\nWell I don't know that though because I see my argument would be that ... we I invested in ... mosque\nMhm right I didn't I invested in him I decided at some point probably after the ... minutes interview\nIn his dentures but as a person\nYeah I thought that guy smart he gets it um and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better in the making a lot of money and so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview I'm watching the wheels come off right when\nShe was a wheeled circling me and just like watching a Tesla with the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome so\nI'm I I think anytime the head of a company like that become so synonymous with the product I think they have to be much more careful about how they live their lives in public that's my feeling on that but but I don't want to take away from him 'cause I Know I agree to use its own genius\nI think he is suppose and stuff a little more on it in ... on public but I mean I think the thought process that everything is pretty consistent whether he was an easy read it or not he claims that that's a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "27"}
