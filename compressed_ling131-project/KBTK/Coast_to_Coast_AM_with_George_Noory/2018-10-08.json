it can create what similar to to ball whitening\nAnd so you have so much of that which is creepy around western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these balls of white are just\nMerely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or they might also have some sense of intelligence and

Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring\nA most of Japan or easily into the range of their of of the American bombers so what the Japanese did was they spread stories to the civilians that if the Americans invaded they would torture kill and you know God Knows\nWhat else civilians are enslave them scare the living daylights right\nAbsolutely terrified to when the Americans did invade the ah civilians were would run off of cliffs and commit suicide and then you know that's a documented piece of history just a terrifying uh a story but now it\nAre stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book is that a group of tourists were had a peace museum near those cliffs and\nAh they were walking in a field near that that museum and they heard the sound of what they considered they said it was almost like a herd of of footsteps coming their way and they couldn't see anything\nAnd then they felt a wind pass them and then later heard what they described as cries and screams so\nThat was pretty moving for me\nUm another story from the Pacific he would Jima is is equally um a heartbreaking and\nHe would Jima ... there are literally thousands of Japanese soldiers that were probably buried alive because they were ... they were a in a tunnel system a very intricate tunnel system under the island and um the the entrances caved in or or\nOr the soldiers were actually burned alive or in the tunnels so there's a story that I write about that one a Japanese civilian worker claims that every time he gets a call that he has to return to the mainland and he\nHe gets a knock on the door and he claims that these spirits of these soldiers on wood Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to the mainland and Japan so those are some pretty intense stories that a crop up and it's ... they're certainly not rare uh in in this volume elite\nWhat's interesting to map is that they seem to be so prevalent all over the place something's going on\nYeah that's true and not only are they everywhere all the different one of the amazing aspects of of the world war two supernatural is that the goose don't even necessarily have to be people because there's actually goes planes that appear especially over England\nAlmost like the flying dutchman ship yeah absolutely exactly people see these planes and they're really not there yet this is um and and I'll tell you a little story from my own family do they hear them too\nWell some do and some do but there's one area or in the United kingdom I'm a it's a northern section of of the u._k. called derby sheer\nAnd it's known as the Bermuda Triangle of um the u._k. it it sounds pretty pastoral sounding so I don't know why there's such activity but there have been a lot of plane crashes there about fifty planes I think if have crashed in that area\nAnd it has quite a reputation but over the years there have been what they called ghost plane flaps so for example in Nineteen eighty five\nI'm a bunch of people a claim to seeing this huge military aircraft flying overhead one couple was I'm\nDriving down the highway\nAnd they sold this very low flying bomber cruising over the highway and they said that it didn't have any sound whatsoever which was remarkable because it was so big and I you know I think they described it as a a for profit a ... engine and it looked like a World War two bomber\nSo of course skeptics believe that it was probably you know ... either a current military plane or possibly\nA um maybe a a bomb or going to an air show or something\nLike that was what they want they thought you know\nWrite but to counter that a lot of these people that solve this first of all\nThere didn't seem to be a pattern a flight with with this there didn't seem to be a straight line as you might see with a a a a a regular conventional non spooky aircraft disappeared in different areas throughout that region\nAnd a couple of the people that spotted this one in particular worked uh for a an airfield during World War two was ... I Believe I'm a somewhat flight mechanic for the for the ...\nOr or a half so definitely would have known the difference between let's say a modern I guess like a Hercules aircraft and something like a B. twenty four or ...\nAnd and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it be twenty four bomber so a pretty peculiar and and there have been other what they call goes plane flaps a throughout history and I think there was even one\nAs I was writing this book so two thousand Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe called the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\nThe one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to the you know see if it did crash or at least to hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust poof like that yeah yeah like they want to do a different time war or something right\nIn the reason I looked into the these are\nA ghost plane stories is when I was young my parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they\nWere starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy a ... make it sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Erie\nThat watch it with my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well England was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any\nAny stories similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they

and roll ghosts of country music more hunted rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest onto the world war two soldiers spirits ghost planes and strange synchronous cities\nPearl Harbor is a hostage or not\nIt's extremely hearted according to a lot of the people that go there and uh\nMany of the people tourists people who were interested in history go there uh we'll talk about the feelings they have when they're torn Pearl Harbor especially the the USS Arizona memorial which is essentially a to a mass grave\n'em and it'll tell you what a a moving experiences and again we we think about that idea that somehow the power of that event has etched itself into the time and space around Pearl Harbor and the ghost stories that are\nHave been told about that a famous area are are are pretty extensive\nThere's one story of a of a sailor who apparently left his watch on the USS Arizona\n[noise] ah just briefly and then er during that time where he left the ship\nIt was attacked and sunk and now there's this story of this for Lauren looking sailor standing at the uh standing at the edge of the memorial kind of looking out into the bay where the Arizona ... an hour or so\nThat goes story's been told a quite a bit um [noise] excuse me ...\nThere's also a story of a of all of one lady who took a picture just of the memorial and of course uh the waves in the memorial and then when she looked at it there seem to be faces in them into the picture\nIs very uh in that went on online throughout and not only is the area Pearl Harbor the harbor itself haunted with therapy and goes stories at places like the show feel barracks and hit them airbase areas that were a part of the the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor\nAnd one place in particular and heck I'm\nA there was the headquarters building that uh supposedly served as a morgue after the attack and had some two hundred three hundred bodies in it\nAnd the places so haunted they said that they moved to the sea cue desk which is usually inside the building they now say they post the guards\nBuilding because of all the complaints that the soldiers had of this ghostly activity the sound of people running up and down steps to such a degree that are the steps the staircase itself would shake so it's a it's a pretty haunted place\nThe desert Fox rumble of the Nazi hands or think leader man some incredible things happened to him to he died in Nineteen forty four mhm but what\nDoes he still haunts\nWell that's probably the most interesting a story that I found a a when I when I started to research this book because I I did initially look to see if I could find the\nThe ghosts of a lot of famous general's pat and Eisenhower as well as some of the the axis powers or and or when Romney has always been a kind of a subject of fascination for me so I started to you know try to find if there were any ghost stories about him\nUh I I thought he might be found in North Africa which is where he gained much of his fame as the desert Fox maybe on the shores of Normandy he would be among those many goes that appear in Normandy he was really behind a\nA architecture the development of the fortifications there are in the constructions of the defenses along with what was considered the their Atlantic Wall or maybe he would be in Germany but I actually found ghost stories about ... in the United states believe it or not\nSo one of the places as mount Hebron cemetery and Winchester, Virginia people claim to see this a figure a long trench coat a cap on\nA looking over the graves and and there are some people who say that he is actually at the the graves or he's seen at the graves of some of patents a general patents ancestors and then there's a A N in West Virginia where they\nClaimed that Romney will haunt so what's the story behind that there is a story that\nAre between the wars ... along with a few other\nGerman generals traveled on a secret trip to America to visit some of the ... the battlefields of the civil war particularly they were looking at the way that Stonewall Jackson maneuver through the Shenandoah Valley so this is why this\nThat uh Irwin ... haunts these areas is is around today they think that uh he has left his spirit here because he once once visited the site now is there any historical basis for this\nI haven't been able to find any in most historians will tell you that it never have happened that the German generals never came here\nAre people who believed the story say it was a a secret mission and therefore there would be no historic record that was kind of the interesting one for me\nAnd what about other World War two infamous people do they still show up pawns\nWell there's some really interesting stories uh for me there's there's one that Churchill still haunts a subway in a\nIn a in London that once served as kind of a temporary bomb shelter\nAnd and and people have seen his spirit there I found the story that Churchill actually witness to the ghost of Abraham Lincoln in World War two to be fascinating ah he said that he and I hate to lay this imagery on your listeners but\nA according to Churchill he had to step down to the bathroom completely naked\nIn what's now called the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House and he had traveled to the White House on several occasions to a visit with a ... FDR Franklin Delano Roosevelt as well as other uh officials from the American side\nUh he steps out of the the bathroom and there's Abraham Lincoln leaning against the mantle and I think Churchill says something like when Lincoln turns to face him Churchill says something like ah I see you've caught me at a disadvantage Mr President and then a Lincoln fades away so\nThat was kind of Lincoln probably faded away quickly\nYes I I would've I would've got out there as fast as I could he's Lincoln has gone through enough he didn't need to witness\nNot I'm not a new Winston Churchill ...\nSo there's some other stories about Eisenhower he haunts ah what's called the bullet which is a a train that's on display at the national railroad museum I think that's in in Green Bay Wisconsin or we talked a little bit about the ghosts of Gettysburg and apparently he andme Amy maybe behind some of the haunting Z\nIn the farmhouse that they used to own their so yeah there's a lot of um a famous ghost stories from uh some of the the\nBigger leaders of uh the most famous leaders of World War two entities\nContinue these hunting\n[noise] yeah they do as a matter of fact uh you know the the bullet a I Believe that has the story that some of the stories that I found out about that\nUh were from the Nineteen nineties the two thousands one story is that I'm a custodian who was a vacuuming the carpet in the bullet ... uh was halfway finished and decided to take a break laugh to lock the door\nOf the the train and uh went to lunch or or have a snack and then when he came back\nThe someone had completed\nThe of vacuuming and he could tell because the lines of the vacuum cleaner were super straight up and down\nAnd according to some of the people who knew Eisenhower he was very meticulous and that's how he insisted on having his the bullet cleaned so that story probably are not too long ago and you know as we talked about the ghost plane flap they're happening probably even as we speak\nIt back in World War two there were actually reports of UFOs they called them to fighters they were small little disc type objects flying all over the place the pilots reported seen did you come across anything like that\nIs that our government that have been hacked all they talk about Russia what about twenty three million Americans the office of Personnel Management white out the

I thought wearing costumes of the civil war and their faces and the expressions were just they were extremely song that they were just awfully awfully worried from the expressions and\nThe smell of something that I had to get away from so I went back in and our guide caught me and said we're have you been and I said\nI just went in and nine I came out and they said we've been looking for you for the last half hour\nWhile while there we are we going to have enough time to watch the filming those costumes are excellent please explain to me how they were able to get that damage that's now hideous melt and they all looked at each other and they see there isn't anyone out there\nAre there are a lot of smells associated with some of these teams man there is a ...\nOf a sense with um with ah some of these haunting sand or\nFor instance the Irwin rumble um go story is really focused on uh the smell of a pipe that he allegedly used to smoke in this this haunted in so there there are stories like that there are stories about people getting to a I think in the\nCase of the heck I'm a airbase there's the scent of a rotting corpses that overwhelms people um the interesting thing for the when the caller reminded me that uh [noise] my history professor told me that one of the most sought after um [noise]\nAh articles or after Gettysburg for the civilians was a kind of um I I think it was I guess you would describe it almost as many drops that they used to put on their nostrils because the the scent was so\nBad and then you know that story certainly reminded me of that\nA couple more months we will be the seventies seventh anniversary of Pearl Harbor I guess there can't be many soldiers or seeming still left\nFrom the Nineteen forty one I mean that that was Seventy seven years ago right and if they were twenty maybe Ninety seven there might be a few but I don't think there are many are there\nNo I don't think so and it's um it's sad because again that that's why I think the important thing is to make sure that these\nThese stories are preserved and the memory goes on and if this book helps that at all or maybe inspires people to look into um [noise] the the

man the him which was popularized by\nAre different ... the originator of the term near death experience and let us bring in Joshua ... worn right now hello there Mr Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight\nIs Halloween the event oh I Love it or we're going to dig into\nThis extremely creepy thing is I come at the mirrors I also have an update for you about time warps in UFOs or later all we're going to give away some free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with\nThe way I'm bump because I've got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of be will be with you OK\nWell you know what when people say that to me it means\nI'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of me will be with you OK\nWell ... you know what when people say that to me it means something so thank you\nGuys aren't the cycle meant the it's a small enclosed area set up with a cheer dim lighting the mirrors angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd the number of other people in person in the psych them anti um technique um and it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager\nBecause I started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the uh local newspaper and I found again and again\nWhen I was going to a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and said this is the most haunting room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I find a room that had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomenon\nUm there are a number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infinite tunnel\nRight like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light is electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of light which operates has some sort of a portal\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but\nWhen you look at a near\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know about consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself and so it's almost like you're creating an infinite tunnel of consciousness there\nAnd it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of these spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to describe why by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek highly polished stone\nBut there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective substance and you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience you have an experience Georgian and then I Want everybody to understand this I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like state known them\nWhen you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional\nSeemingly Corp portrayal figure that will appear right in front of you head to toe and this being can come up to you and not only speak to you but touch you\nAnd so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to does it go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho ... they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother than he would take you through a period of time that could be days\nWhere he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find that reminds you of her and he pictures and he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there your mind is charged with that intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through now when this becomes\nVery scary as when you have people who experiment\nOr you know people talked about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble or the ... thing you know you have people who go in there and they just say I don't care I just want to see something and\nWhen you go in there with that attitude that's a ... you you will well you know you get what you ask for right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a psycho Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact uh over the years I've done many experiments where you know we'll set up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair\nAnd so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall\nOf a dimly lit room with a chair in front of\nIt and I'm not that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kind of stuff\nYeah I think we ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays L. E. D. laugh in the background\nAnd maybe some white noise I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with a and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through cycle met him experience and I would say that a\nLot of people ...\nIt is a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody and a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say\nA hundred percent but I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had the full on anthrax\nI did in fact I broke this story on coast to coast am shooting them ... before I even did it [laughter] and I know that that that\nSounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology on going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said where of course that plays turned out to be ... I'm from Las Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia and Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between\nLas Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert and it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in the state\nWere incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred and so uh I have of course continued now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um\nI mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way it was very cool that you played a a a group from\nAshville North Carolina regroup part [laughter] you know ...\nMy home town for for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my history museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting to play a an Ashville group [noise] but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery\nIn context okay\nUm and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just incidents or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that is sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to view it\nAnd of course I never believed coincidences joins\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe and that would mean you'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does of George new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media\nBut it was not it was not\nNo I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop\nUh and this was a program that was of course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was who was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind\nUh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow up\n[noise] now later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and solve the very night that I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force\nSo here I Am next area fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announced that there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around that same time George nap whom we all know we all love who is of course a journalist here in\nThe state of Nevada and they're doing one yes he is the best uh he released this incredible mind\nBoggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine if any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by\nThis advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings he goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involved\nPro space related findings he goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons\nCommunications and propose and\nStandard management in safeguarding for classified information are not sufficient he goes on to say even more and this is the one that really gets me associated exotic now that that will that word exotic what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies\nLikely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries an unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here\nSo he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified live independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise] he's saying George we\nHave discovered that exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's why we we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is it didn't come from them\nNew so if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic we're could've possibly come from um I also wanted to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to Des where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project and some of these topics this thirty eight of them are one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking wormholes in space time gravity wave communication worked drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientist and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there's one that's redacted so anyway\nGetting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and a ... with which July twenty fifth All right so that said\nNow we move up to August\nAugust twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville George ...\nThe mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry\nWhich is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb and they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beach to nail us air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore guests when they were doing their experiments June\nOf two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space force so that said\nI Am of the impression here that there is some kind of amazing technology\nThat is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry that is being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt when I'm telling you you can download this information for free if you go to Joshua ... Warren dot com\nAnd scroll down the home page there's a place where you can it says something like you know Senator Harry Reid's PBS or whatever and you can you can download that now you tell me

peoples were already living there as we now\nHave dozens of cities and counties have chosen to instead celebrate Columbus Day as indigenous people's day it seems just started in Berkeley in the early

can complain about the past you have\nYou can procrastinate you could talk about it you can do many things in fact or you can just plain do it the faster you do it however the faster you'll get it done you see when it comes to a central time management there is no fancy advice just playing practical wisdom just do it\nDo what you have to do do what's most important first just get it done because of the end of the day just as there is no such thing as half\nYou're either dead or alive there's also no such thing as a task half done if you have something to do with these are done or it's not done and you need it done so do it\nFor inspiration along the way to get done all the things you need to do listen to tackling light my pod cast with the legendary motivator an NFL great ...\nForce winds and maybe a category one storm a this is the this is the time of year that happens\nSo to be prepared is one thing but for the news media every single time one of these happens\nTo make it sound like the world is coming to an end is pretty damn irresponsible what is responsible is that people are warned\nAs to what to do and how to do it one wonders whether there are people who do pay attention yeah but the people who don't those who say oh I'm going to wait it out and then they expect to be\nRecovered expect to be said and those people are just to leave him\nThere and that's why I'm ordering people try and make it sound like the end of the world every single time because somehow after all the time people still don't aren't cared for it maybe that's what I don't understand people who live in these areas and they still every year act surprised that you know they\nAre gay wow this is the thirteenth named tropical\nStorm of the season and the season lasts probably maybe a chance or over the next two or three weeks that there would be another one that were developed by the time we get to the end of October pretty much go put ski let's go backwards shall we ladies\nOr the Senate passed one point seven billion dollar disaster aid package\nFor the states that were ... by the last Hurricane Florence last year not remember than what it did a Carolina this storm that ... is going to dumped earns more water\nOn those states that got tons of water in Hurricane Florence so that's where the real danger is\nUh and so it but it sort of tied together with this um\nThe ah we talked about this little bit but I don't think we I think we gave it short shrift this bill was passed late friday or was overwhelmingly by the way past by the Senate for two reasons one disaster\nAid helping people to keeping the Federal Aviation administration running and included in that is the passenger bill of rights\nGiving the department of justice and homeland security the authority to frack drones they may be a credible threat\nAlso how the airlines run their business how the airlines act\nWhen it comes to things like over booking practical things that have affected probably all of us who fly the bills specifically says airlines cannot force passengers off the plane\nThey must compensate passengers who are kicked off and over ... plane so I'm trying to figure this out the bill says airlines can't force you off\nAnd then it says you must be compensated if you're kicked off [laughter]\nSo are we really clarification on that one that I mean if you're booted from your flight before you get on it\nOh once you out there on your plane they can't pay you off I get out there that makes sense like you\nBecause I don't think that's a law in New York City once you're in a taxi cab by law they're not allowed to kick you out why would you get\nIn and then you quote that's why you always get in and close the door before you tell the guy where you want to go to guy is a lot of them can refuse to do and I don't want to go to Brooklyn or no I don't want to go there and then they like eight honor Yorker yeah yeah that I mean look at that\nHow many people that I you know I never knew that\nIt happening every day to tourists they open the door and they go can I go to JFK and the guy speeds off and they don't want to if they don't want to go to certain places but if you get in and you close the door to the law they have to go where you tell them to\nHuh All right thank you I was in your area and I thought everybody knew that but I can now I don't know that ... that's ... remember that now next time I think a gap in New York dumping nightmarish it in in order them around and then posted or yeah All right today\nIs the most wasted inefficient use of time day in the\nSyrian sixty five days and we have every year\nUm I usually boycott even talking about Columbus Day because he was such a no good bastard it was a waste of time this was a ... day is a waste of time and so and the fact that we don't have people in school on this day to teach what really Columbus was about it even more offensive\nNot if they're in school today I feel like I say yeah not around here\nThey are no they're not and that's good is\nThat something new I didn't think they 'cause when I was\nI never had a people honoring any worse day where they shouldn't use and no good useless piece of you know what so\nWhat do I really think is it a banquet holiday today it's like that caller them to the banks and post office gangs are those of us\nWill get an email today all in
