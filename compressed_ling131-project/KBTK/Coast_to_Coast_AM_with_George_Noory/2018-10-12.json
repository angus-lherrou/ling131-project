S. S. U. International Space station what are they doing up there\nI think we're watching for alien mostly I mean maybe it'll British TV show what would the UFO er that base and trigger detectors said they called it I I think it kind of our version is that I mean I don't I don't know what else are you when they're not doing a whole heck of a lot of science and it\nYou got money to buy things when they're down I mean imagine if you could buy the best companies of the world like Amazon or apple or whatever or Coca Cola for eighty percent off or Ninety\nOff because they're going they're going to have another dog\nYeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollars in next time it\nGoes to four thousand instead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down ... percent and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on a trip when what did the indicators I mean the market the last two days is really taking it on the Jim what's the cause for that is it just panic or ... what's happening\nWhat will will to things in and actually they both relate back to the good old Donald\nHum last week you saw 'em treasury bond you you know the yields on on the risk free ten thirty or\nBonds shoot up I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this what happened we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks up above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to four point three percent in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and higher or lower it so\nYou know that that was the first thing to happen but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean this this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be cheating and a lot of ways\nBy China's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh\nIf China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a worldwide a downturn in crash and so so it was rising interest rates\nAnd um and and and more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about\nFor the last month at twenty six forty\nI'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know a few years ago it crashed\nForty five percent of three months and then I had this kind of limp rally for years and has been waiting to go back and said look at breaks twenty six forty that that's a sign that China is starting to go down again and it and it did that and the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign\nThat there's something wrong and and again that was the biggest concern a lot of people thinking oh it's just more interest rates note the interest rates was the first whack these last three days had a lot more to do with China and Trump\nIs really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways and Trump has been good seeing the comedy with tax cuts and all this sort of stimulus and stuff\nAnd that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes grows to go up temporarily and what does the Federal Reserve is going to do this\nAnd stuff and that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes\nGross to go up temporarily and what is the Federal Reserve going to do they're going to raise interest rates that what they do if the economy overheating they raise interest rates if it's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous and and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I've created this great thing and the trumps wrecking it no\nThis was predictable he's not you know he's got some you know gut feelings we gotta do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences of things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pulled back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose what have you read in a couple more days of downturns tomorrow we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people start saying there's something wrong here\n[noise] [noise] yes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this at the beginning of the year markets peaked in in late January real kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough\nWe have a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent different markets but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped right about here you know where we are now and then it kinda like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude\nWhat happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay this things over and they start selling and shorting to market it happened very quickly you'll see you know I've seen this the last seven\nStock bubbles throughout history everything from the Nikkei and the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash in every other one in the last century including the tech rack and recent bubbles\nThat first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two and a half\nMonths with people get whacked\nAnd that's the sign that that's the only way you know the the bubble has finally birth the problem is by the time that comes people already in trouble and they're panicking and they get whacked hard so we did the danger sign is if we keep going down and and and literally the markets do look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just a bounce after\nYou know fourteen hundred points it may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far but it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers Seventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand on the Dow\nIf the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders\nAre going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds to keep going up that\nThis is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not\nFifty fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy eighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash will happen in the first two to three months typically and bats what may bottles so dangerous um uh\nYou know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross trial once you know when somebody asked what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit early because that level and to this is above all this isn't a normal bull market\nThat correct so nice staircase manner and goes down bubbles go up dramatically and they crash and in half the time and they crashed twice or is dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this\nThis is a once in a lifetime of vent and it it the science to me are building we'd been telling people man this looks like a top here in the garden and top here we only get\nThe good part is we can gauge as if we only get a normal ten Fifteen\nPercent or so correction by the end of the year then we're probably good for one more route one more Trump rally end of next year before this thing blows but the right now though the odds are shifting towards a it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will this be as bad as that time period\n[noise] what will this is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George ... decades in advance on demographics the baby boom peaking\nAnd and and and causing a down turn out to the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries well what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and then their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nThe low interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy\nFor emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kinda like went sideways and didn't the laboratory debt emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy\nTrillion more on top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred and ... trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world\nAnd and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble\nChina is slowing and and like I said they have the\nBiggest debt bubble of anybody in any time in history and then when China blows a weird we're going to be worse so so\nMy view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and the stock crash because they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just filled the pub backup with money that was draining\nThis time more debt everything's\nMore stretched the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and redo so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a fifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty per\nSe she was absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing down here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come back here with us his website is his name ... D. E. N. T. dot com couple of his books include the Democrat demographic cliff syllable lifetime and ...\nSunday mornings any Ninety seven boys one of the\nMeals you Sherry so if we quality companies that have solid earnings got money in the bank their stocks could still get when everybody else gets hit and they go down but it doesn't mean that company is going to go out of business right\n[noise] right again well any time you get a major downturn a recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure and that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and governments the recessions is bad thing\nThey're good things um\nBut and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a super bubble I mean the tech bubble took five years the bill but the dot com crash came in the last\nYear and a half a six to seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies will not end well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if it apart Amazon there oh my God I was you know like a\nYou know a hundred and fifty dollars and now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies and you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued in a bubble like this but they're also\nGo down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down Ninety three percent that ended up being that was it ended up being the greatest company and the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing so\nThat's the secret and and the other thing is even if the earnings of companies if companies are so good that\nThey keep their earnings flat instead of declining evaluations on stocks how many times earnings white people will pay thirty times earnings for the typical stock right now or forty and and sixty or eighty for the best tax on\nThose collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down fifty percent even if its earnings don't decline and then of course most companies' earnings do decline so that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator looking at some of the dangers what is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know it it's called the smart money\nYou know unless it's not a secret\nWell I Know I Know believe\nMe Wall Street won't if there's any way so you don't have to worry but\nBut what what happened that they're the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups stuff and and and then when things go down there that wants to jump in and buy when when when they see the old investors have over Bachmann stocks or about they're the ones that short for us I mean they're in the know\nAnd and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks they eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff well they you can measure\nThis action what if there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is that dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes I mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions in the futures market there ahead of everything\nAnd so the market's gonna open down it opens down right at the open court opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves there may well that's one that dumb money and most people would stop just something to protect themselves that's one of those reactions may that's the money\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit and shorter do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour into the clothes so they measure this indicator measures but the smart money is doing versus a dumb money and the smart money\nHas not bought this rally in fact they'd been shorting it\nThey've been betting against this rally ever since that bottom in February this year after that crap now they bought in to the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to\nJanuary top early this year but once that crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is declines and smart money buying and that has been a strong warning signal\nTo me in in recent months into our subscribers\nAre you in Puerto Rico on them\nI Am in Puerto Rico and I went through a hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo where it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here\nAnd Michael both of them similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours in Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable\nUh to watch everything I mean windows blowing up all around me you know you walk out the next morning and all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stuff it it's just unbelievable it's it's like you know God got angry or something you know and that threw a temper tantrum\nDon't you moved there well\nI moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and co labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has ... in ...\nTo islands that are like St Thomas and St Croix or St John and\nAnd you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there and and I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family for many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working on this place\nSpending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade than it was when I first started coming\nIn I said to my why don't we move here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality on a corner of the price of South Beach Miami where we're used to live\nAnd and we're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport which I get to twenty minutes in advance they only check your id they just wait to see how you're going to ...\nBelow al I'm not sure I liked that part\nIt's fun to play it it's a thirty minute\nAnd it's an advanced they don't even check your id they just wait to see how you're

hour and once I got down here I realize I I could qualify for some tax advantages here which are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living in the crypto guys are coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses that can qualify there's real strong tax advantages so I'm living much cheaper\nAnd a great climate I can still fly to New York in four hours director Miami in two hours and almost anywhere in the east coast is now it's difficult if I'm coming out your way but I have to go out to California which I just did for a long time that that the long haul now but I tell ya I\nI like it down here they've been in a recession there's no civil unrest a recession for twelve years we're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent ear and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\nAnd then I'm just going to see what happens in the next uh so many years\nThe big banks down there\n[noise] yeah yeah yeah ... and ... and ... down here and I actually love the banks are by bank of popular in Santander or Spanish Banks because this is by origin more of a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but they there are George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service so people either\nJust because they think we're in Zimbabwe or they charge some huge X and there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special pasta sauce and things like that I otherwise\nMan this is a good deal and you know I'm Down here for other reasons but I tell you people ought to be Americans ought to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower um\nMy name in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that that they aren't allowed to vote in our elections\nWill will most important they are allowed to freely move for immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good then they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities and\nThen when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico to put their kids to colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then\nSometimes a lot of times they'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving\nTo the United states why sixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they end up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants from Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people and that's why\nThey have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides and the U.S is better to help create good jobs down here the tax advantages rather than just out now subsidized Puerto Rico because\nThe U.S has always always ... best people and again it it's they're more professional educated people are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\nSo I Want you to you is your best impressions what you think will happen economic lead this country seems to be mired right now in conflict\nTo those sending messages saying hey she has a right to do this before she

saying flat out we're facing truth civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats\nAnd a starting with that Puerto Rican example\nA and I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives that chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas have been struck dumb because of liberal\nDemocratic policies uh we're having them going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote you know heard instinct Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times\nIn a ... mirror real quickly\nYou're right about the Democratic thing there's no way that that Puerto Rico's going to become a state now with the Republicans in charge\n'em and and and they want to become a state now they didn't before because they didn't get the hell helping Maria [noise] they were you see if you go to Orlando I used to be in Tampa right near their Orlando is getting is are the ones getting these high call I'm telling you in Puerto Rico here there's a shortage of doctors Dennis professionals\nEverything because those are the people most moving so it may not be happening Rochester but you go to Orlando or Texas you're\nGoing to see a different story and most of the Puerto Ricans in the fifties and sixties moved up into the northeast but the\nThey're mainly moving into Florida first and then places like Texas so\nIt is it is a mixed bag but I agree with you a hundred percent there is this red blue war and it is serious and there is going to be a lot of tensions and civil unrest and if there's this much now imagine what it would be like if we had Fifteen Percent unemployment in the U. S. like there is in Puerto Rico now and that is one difference\nThese Puerto Ricans are not um don't have that sort of tension in that polarity that's the one thing I can tell you because I'm sitting here and I haven't even seen a bar fight\nNear the less than a crime where where I Am\nHere in fact the Hispanics in most African American you wrote in a democratic\nBig deal ... what what was his point\nWell he well he's saying that that you know the the rich people don't like that these are people who are going to vote blue and we got this blue red wars or when they see Puerto Ricans he's saying come to Rochester well we don't like him and he said they're not as high skilled well I'm telling you in Orlando they're not saying that they're they are basically\nA reinvigorated Orlando there's four ... four hundred and fifty thousand Puerto Ricans now in just Orlando in a million\nIn Florida and those million which which she is right about or tilting the boat all all the key Senate race and stuff and guess who they're appealing to those Puerto Ricans the Republican and the Democrats Rick Scott and Bill Nelson running for Senate they're both courting the Puerto Ricans 'cause they're five percent of the vote and that's enough to swing an election\nAnd they do is the one I'm a crowd it isn't that what our democracy ...\nYes it is it is\nLet's go to Greg in New Jersey taken away Gregory\nRight yes my question George and good morning I'm just like to say I live in a congressional district in northern New Jersey we get thirty percent of our federal tax dollars back but blue states subsidized the red states and ... and the state that receives the most was Kentucky where the idiot McConnell was I'm a distrust\nBack the blue states subsidized they're red states and ... and the state to receive the most was Kentucky where the idiot McConnell with the stresses me nuts and it's been like this for fifty years we subsidize the south in the southwest the northeast us an SOS the mid west\nAnd I was ... for your guest I've been reading the Financial Times for many years and ... what you're saying this was a column every week scaring the heck out of all of us with with what you're saying\nOoh we'll be closer to home I'm about four years from retirement if it were thirty five years almost forty years or entity which was nationwide ... through New York\nOr pension was over funded in the late nineties it took a horrendous hit with the ... the tech stocks and then in two thousand they almost killed obliterate his yeah we have a meeting with thousands of it's about to retire right all high tech guys and gals the whole thing\nWe have a meeting in about three weeks or entity and I don't trust any of that but you know Wall Street I think there should be your ... your team set up there if you will again and I'm frankly rose bushes should come down from heaven and come back\nBut the thing is what do we ask our financial people who are running our pension fund with their fancy suits what are they doing to anticipate this problem and I'll take your answer off the air [noise]\nYeah you know real quick there there's two problems not only the stock market starts collapsing everybody's been driven end of the stock market because quantitative easing monetary policy's\nPush down long term rates that you can get on safer investments like treasury bonds and corporate bonds and things like that which pension plan should be more and but\nBut you can't get your seven to eight percent returns they used to get with a conservative combination of stocks and bonds so everybody's gone more stocks stock start collapsing\nThen they're in trouble the truth is as much as it's counter intuitive a pension plan today the best thing you can do what we're telling people right now this this break up and ... is going to make bonds\nA corporate bonds and treasury bonds long term more attractive if that thirty year treasury bond goes up to four point three percent we're telling our subscribers this is likely to happen in the next several months for the next year at the most you're going to want to lock those and not only to get a four point\nThree percent return is way better than almost any stock dividend but those bonds will appreciate when stocks collapse and the economy slows down and interest rates go down bonds like falling interest rate so right now is not the time to buy these bonds but there's going to be a huge opportunity for investors\nAnd pension funds to lock in quality bonds it's only the quality bonds that did well in the great depression AAA corporate\nTen in thirty year treasury bond lock in those things for appreciation and for higher yields and don't be in stock the worst place to be for pension plan is to do with everybody that run into stocks and collapse and you also write about blue states subsidizing read\nThat's why I think this time around it's going to be the blue states that succeed against red policies that they don't agree with but most of all they're like okay see what happens to your red economy when New York and California when the northeast and the west coast succeed from the union it it would it would be a problem\nLet's go to Thomas and the whole EU California he Tom go ahead\nHey George thank you for taking my call sir Harry your research is really appreciated um [noise] I mean you know\nYou brought up earlier that a corollary to depressions and major recessions this war and\nYou could argue that\nWorld today in San Antonio\nThird world war that's a proxy war you know in places like Syria Yemen the south China Sea cetera and one global corporations cannot compromise their differences in the global boardrooms\nThere was a shooting war just like World War one world war two Korea\nVietnam and on and on so\nDon't you think I mean a limited nuclear exchange could turn the United states and to a third world country in a day or two you know with a lecture magnetic poles it's cetera what is the probability of a shooting war\nYou know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan\nI'm there but but what we're saying and zero hour we we trade global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge into World War one people don't realize globalization global trade collapse sixty percent\nBetween World War one and World War two with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising tariffs just like we're seeing now everything's happening like happening\nThis works ... it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole everybody loses or at least most countries lose [noise] and and that's what's happening now this trade war with China\nWhether ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea that could definitely be stopped there there's no question\nThere's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because\nNobody is big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have is there's\nThere is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one somebody hit us they would be dead long before we would so I think that's kind of a good thing we're in in the early Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundreds no there were major countervailing powers has how you could have World War two but we're going to definitely have\nA political huge political sees this trade war we said in zero hour before this became obvious this is going to last two or three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and\nThere there could be some physical war but they're certainly\nGoing to be huge a political and trade wars and things\nStates mental things mean everything stage I think it would apply\nHi I'm Tom Cox owner lines ... dot com or as a family owned and operated business I started over eight years ago when my wife and I moved

I mean everything is different this is not like you know the eighty two thousand eight to nine cracked and it's not like the seventies correction stock corrections back then were fifty percent that's more typical this is more like these great resets\n... de leveraging of a bubble debt and financial assets which of course stock is are the leading ones when that happens Seventy percent is kind of the minimum you look for in up to eighty and in in the Nineteen twenty nine crashed\nEighty nine percent for the ... eighty nine percent so\nI'm looking for levels like that I think my range is Seventy five percent minimum up to eighty five percent that's when you start looking to buy and again we have the same thing on the flip side for bonds right now if that thirty year treasury bond which is a been a three point four percent recently\nIf that gets up to over four percent between four and four point three percent that's when I started by even though that's the best thing in the downturn it's too early to buy that right now if you're going to park you might just be unsafe short term\nBonds and CDs and T bills and stuff to preserve your money\nNext step is moving the long term quality bonds and then\nAnd and and the sectors I mean commodities while in emerging markets overseas will probably bottom first\nAnd then developed countries stocks and then real estate so there'll be a succession of buying opportunities so I mean and stuff like that you're in a good market like like like like marijuana pot industry especially the medicinal side which is a slam dunk winter long term wait for the car you make it\nTo buy into that a little earlier than something like you know home builders\nNext on that one is in Paducah, Kentucky first time caller for civil Whelan\nOr then something like you know home builders\nNext on that one has to do good Kentucky first time caller for civil Whelan\nHey George a lot of the show McCall\nCorrect me if I'm wrong here but red states are Republican yup\nOkay ... Democrats were Democrats or make a dent did you not signing earner did I miss understand you've made you said the south was read during the civil war\nYes they they would have been they would have been more even though you know they called Lincoln a Republican back then the Republican Party was not the same I Know my father help build the Republican Party in the south and help get Nixon elected through southern voters\nAnd that's a whole different party had to convince a lot of democratic politicians and senators that they were really Republican they were Democrats traditionally all the way back to the civil war so ... the Republican democratic label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean read\nIs Republican blue is Democrat in the present time frame and then the Republicans in charge now if you do see a major downturn I Am just have to tell you from history it is going to favor\nThe Democratic party just like it did in the thirties where you had Republicans who were coming into that when things crash they go to the people that are going to hand out money to the people there that you know the ... they go to the Democrats\nIn a downturn in a book in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation that favors the Republicans we are\nOur long term research shows we are going to switch from Republican era here to democratic one for a number of decades and that's just something you know the blue people are gonna like that the red people won't but all I Do is report the facts I'm I'm not\nPart is and and my work Republicans are always going to be here Democrats if it's a play of opposites that's just as important as men and women and booms and busts and inflation and deflation and every other play of opposite\nAnd it goes back and forth the same thing the west has dominated the world uh since since uh the industrial revolution well guess who's going to dominate in the coming decades and even century it's going to be the east and that's another trend we can clearly show through cycles so so what we do\nIs just show people here's the trends this sector that sector inflation deflation\nThis country that country blue ... I mean we can do all this stuff the long term it's surprisingly predictable\nAnd that's where Congress get it wrong communist think the short term predictable I'm guessing\nWhen I tell you I think

business as well it's a really basic but she just he's getting it but there are a lot of people who just don't get what they deserve maybe ask drew in life but\nYeah this is a way of sort of caught fire\nAll right so that takes care of that big deal from yesterday here's some info on Adam Levine a there's a new NBC talent contest\nAnd thanks for being songwriters and going to get the spotlight there there's a series called song land eleven episodes of song land giving undisclosed undiscovered songwriters chance to create a big hit but take to make a hit record\nAnd each episode of the show\nFive contestants work with music cruises and a recording artist to\nTunes that they have already written\nOne winter per episode will have his or her song released as the artist next single is actually kind of interesting idea\nIt's kinda fun to see the behind the scenes of have songs yeah I'm definitely in for sure back over time before first episode of who's Ryan Tatar of one Republican\nSongwriter Esther dean at a country singer songwriter named Shane McNally\nCharlie ... is a recording artist I don't know anything about him to you [noise]\nUh yeah he he's a current you know very popular recording artists I guess they choose one artist seeing each of the three star or five songs I guess which kind of makes sense that even the playing field\n... Dave Stewart from the arithmetic teaming up with Adam Levine as executive producer of the TV show would be contestants apply that to an upcoming website NBC is going to set up so good luck to those of you who can get on that it's twenty eight at the out\nMaybe you're taking much for\nEnvironment shape lives this emotional management I'm Dr Christian country the environment plays a role in how we developed don't think so try sitting in a dirty prison cell in solitary confinement for a week I think it will have an effect on you\nHow about going to a posh vacation spot for the same amount of time\nAlthough we are a combination of genetics and environment there certainly no doubt that the environment plays a huge role in how we experience the world so be mindful of the environment around you you might as well the music you listen to the visual stimuli the bombard your eyesight most frequently\nAnd the people you listen to an all around the most because the environment you live in just playing a role in shaping how you experience and live your life for more awareness about the world around you listen to tackling like my new podcast with NFL legend Ray Lewis and\nYou can read invoices without it\nYou can print status reports spreadsheets do that a record through and twelve minutes without you\nThe the the the\nThe managing director of public entities for example to do in my state in the department of motor vehicles as just tone deaf\nTo what's going on in the farm and keep hassling farmers with stupid stuff instead of supporting the family farm government doesn't seem to get it as so let's do our part to make sure that you express some kind of love to some farmer that you know\nAnd and acknowledge not only what I don't know for knowledge is the important thing go buy some stuff on the farm great time for pumpkins wow\nWe have ah the ice cream bus at one of my nearby friend farmers are Hansen's is around the corner instance from around the corner from my farm and they have a big pumpkin festival and South Asians and thousands and thousands of pumpkins voted the best\nA pumpkin presentation of the state of Massachusetts interesting enough I gave him some big bales of hay the rap bills you know the big round five by five things and he painted um orange the refuge program [laughter]\nAnd it's fine I think he probably could go or just for the heck of it for a moment because I Would you choose to see if you can find instance farm\nUm if you just Google it or maybe ... ... it's ... oh and H. A. N. S. O. N. uh answering farm dot com I think it is anyway\nFarmers' markets are important you can shop there I Know they have some of the best farmers markets in California where I Am part of the year and it's a it's a business of but maybe even better plan now this is what my daughter did with my grandson\nTo play in a small garden and watched the seeds grow so he will understand where food comes from so many youngsters to they don't know where the milk comes from where the fruit comes from where the vegetables that they don't like to eat come from so\nPlayground guarded there's something that's my brother and his fiance have a really beautiful organic garden that they've been working on for a couple of years now yeah and it's so satisfying I see how happy they are when they get\nYou know big leaves of kale and and when they get a little baby eggplant that grows and I think there if I had you know actual like soil room I Would probably want to try it out too because it just I see how much satisfaction and funding have with it and when you get to eat something that you've grown yourself it's it's a really cool feeling\nYeah it is I'm just looking at are Hansen's a\nForeigner extras on that website\nYeah I don't see any of that which is not smart on their part [laughter]\nUm anyway uh the uh the well is that there are pictures just what the activities are that are going on but there is a in terms of\nWhere you can go for lots of weekend activities during the month of October a lot of these family farms have big celebrations and\nA half so they have a hard farm that kind of stuff but it's a ... the agra tourism business has become begin to change the shape of some farms not necessarily for the better as far as I'm concerned just kind of let yourself\nIn on what goes on it used to be that so many people who are connected in one way or another the farm that's not the case today because only to present actually less than two percent of the population grows the food for the other Ninety eight percent many people are not as strange necessarily but they just aren't around farmers farmers markets making a big resurgence\nOf that school if you want to know what is going on\nOn the farm you can every week we have a different story than retailing I have some thoughts and the news of what's going on in the farm so the podcast again can be found in American family farmers show dot com each week this week we had a lady who wrote a book about a cow\nAnd I was happy Carroll wasn't so happy when she was listening to me call the cows\nCome from us that's\nThe book is called Columbus was okay with that my ears just wearing a little bit of pain\nOkay they were bleeding\nAllowed comments please All right so that's a that's why I wanted to spend emitted with the all of you talking about uh the situation\nOn donations the kinds of things that are uh that you ought to probably pay attention to in terms of what's going on ah the um\nThe there are so many things happening this weekend to call attention to what the what the results of the of the um\nI'm I just had lost ... story sorry about that as you can do and it's funny how we can now we're so I'm moving from one screen to the I got three screens in front of me I'm moving bang bang boom\nI've gotten actually pretty good at it [laughter] when it's like somebody pulls the plug sometimes stuff just stop so I don't want to do this anymore\nSo if you want to donate to hurricane relief efforts may I suggest there may be Korea you can pull up or a couple of you'd like to suggest as well as far as making donations are concerned\nAh the folks that UNICEF interestingly enough\nHave been supportive of uh some of these events and that's not a bad place in the United nations the children's emergency fund is what it is and it seems to get more recognition this time of year because a lot of people collect money for UNICEF on Halloween instead of collecting candy like money or maybe both\nAre so they're involved in this uh there are um a couple of other things\nAre children and families at risk is another good organization save the children\nIs a a good organization as I've said before I'm only going to say at once here they don't want to keep beating the drum the red cross is not a good place to give your money to they have way too much money they don't manage it well and a lot of it doesn't get to where you want it to go so if you really want to help\nThese people are victims the survivors have you seen some of the pictures of the towns especially the coastal towns this was the biggest storm\nOf the century if not you know it was very powerful hundred and fifty five mile an hour winds at one point during the day on Wednesday or it is really a disaster down there three hundred and Seventy five thousand people are out of their homes a and a lot of people just I mean you look at the pictures\nWe've seen so much of this though does it seem that way this year it was just me she lives in towns underwater and just things ripped out on the ground and it just seems more I'm more either that or are more conscious of it what do you think Victoria well\nI think that where I I don't know that it's more because we had\nWell no you know what I think because Hurricane Harvey\n... it had a lot of flooding and damage and things like that in ... in ah in Houston so we all thought that I think with the east coast when you see Florence how how how much rain there was just everywhere and then all the floodwaters and the storm surge and then to have a hurricane Michael can then right after\nWe the same thing like you know more of it I think it just it it's just a really unfortunately times\nPhenomenon and it's it's probably going to take a really long time for all of that damage to be assessed and for it to be on the road to recovery\nYeah well\nI don't know what the solution is some people say we got to change the way we live on the planet fossil fuels all that\nStuff that may be part of it but there is this just the way the cycle goes in and you can throw your hands up in the air and say oh well\nCan we do something about it well there are more people who live in these areas that's the focus on the devastation is probably more a back in the era or back and we were talking about farming being twelve thousand years old or more or you can be sure that during that era on any coastal area there were no houses\nOn because they knew to stay away from it plus they couldn't Bernie food they couldn't survive along the coast unless they were they knew how to fish and that was well into you know they\nNearly of folks on the planet are there are some people say human life goes back thirty thousand years some people said it was like three hundred thousand years however the first person to walk on the planet didn't know there were a fish in the ocean\nAnd there may have been because of my philosophy okay everybody get ready to roll your eyeballs back now that people who are here came from other planets be interesting but it'd be interesting to know what are the food sources are\nThinking about uh Matt Damon being on Mars and how he grew is food [laughter] remember that from the movie\nThe ... yeah yeah so how did people originally figure out how to grow food it's really weird that first scene cumbersome you ever wonder stuff like that or am I the only one of these crazy enough to wonder stuff like that perhaps it is I don't know what is that you might be I could be\nA moderately unique in my point of view and I guess that's what makes for a an interesting DJ be show a here's something that I Want to promote because I think it's very good for you most of the things that we talk about here that I talk about any way the things that are promoted\nFor your natural homeopathic stuff or things like my pillows\nUse the ... D JV this week to save up to fifty percent in some cases fifty five percent on some of the things that they are a promoter have introduced that new premium plus pillow for example I bet you can buy this week any pillow in the catalog by\nOne of any pillow you had the second one free\nAnd so enjoy the sleeping enjoy the travel ... whatever it is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Kachina Village", "day": "12"}
