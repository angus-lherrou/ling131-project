of these kids don't have that something to fall back on now all they had you know well it must be a cult thought because I saw it on a movie or um I saw him walk through the wall or their blood

energy on somebody it's not as big of a ritual as people think it is\nI mean if you think about it you don't care for your neighbor and every day ... what are you fighting about you're fighting about the property line\nSo every day when you see him come out of his house and go on his garage to leave or cut its grass you're sitting there in your kitchen watching him going oh you jerk I Hope you

Will say a prayer for you\nExactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen Everytime she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't debts yet\nNow can that person one realize this is happening to them in to fight it off\n[noise] they can eventually but remember calmer you know be careful who you credit for a while under the bus ... you never know what\nGoes around comes true that's true right but I mean the the recipient of the curve ... for example oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI didn't get this done with enough intent or if you actually go to some one first cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody they pretty much know it easily\nTo three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one two or all three of them and and no particular order is health money or relationships\nAnd you know of all of a sudden you're twenty two years

anybody can remove negative energy off of somebody you can't do it to yourself\nBut you can definitely have a friend do it and once that is released and gone you're fine the same thing with health if

want to talk about the dream stayed what can be conjured up that way but when someone puts a crush on an individual mhm does the individual\nWhat happens to them do they feel something do they see I think someone put a curse on me\nWell when things start going bad and you don't feel good or your relationships go down there too but you lose your job and you can find a job\nUm then they start thinking that's when you hear on the born loser I must have a cloud over my head\nOr if I didn't have bad luck I wouldn't have any luck and people don't realize that especially if everything was going fine in their life or normal in their life\nAnd everything gets going down the tubes and eventually they figure it out or they go to somebody or somebody that they know go gene ... luck for the last year what the heck's wrong\nWhen they start thinking about it and like I said you know what nobody has to live like that you don't have to be a martyr\nSomething about it have it removed it's\nNot hard to do you can do it\nAnd as long as you know ... actually a person doesn't even believe they have a curse on him and I tell them that they do sit down in front of me I'll take this off of you they don't even have to believe that all they had to do is give me their permission\nMy grand daughter got a promotion where she was working and uh apparently she got a promotion over somebody who thought they were entitled to that job and she did it fair and square and you know decent and everything she's great girl\nAnd ... strange things started happening to her I mean things that would always go well\nThings were really kinda screwed up and she called me up one day and said papa ... I think somebody put a curse on me and and I said ... let's let's think about this for a moment ... who would want to do this to you I mean you're in good fun person you're nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over and I went oh ha and then they said\nOh the couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes ... and sure enough it ended up being the person who apologized and took the curse off apparently and everything's fine\nBut stop sending negative energy to her a war off right exactly so\nMy question is when someone does get hit by a curves mhm how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who put the curse on them [noise]\nThat's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is [noise]\nUm did you take somebody away from their spouse in other words that you have an affair with a married person believe you me a woman you know ... ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to find somebody in the nose a woman gets angry at somebody\n... women are meaner than men she's gonna curse that person and because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens\nAnd but the bottom line is this who cares who did it get get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself do you have to call ... ... how do you get at all\nNo you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and they can't they don't have to believe it they just have to go through the ritual and in ... when do speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nIs every buddy susceptible to a curse what about someone who's got so much energy and positivity can they put up this force field to kind of block it and shield it\nNo unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the curses\nThe necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off the\nEnd there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that maybe has to be do something at every full moon or generational curses they just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were first\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed\nMost people as long as they you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have a curse removed off of them again it does not affect them as a matter of fact think about the ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's a game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York and\nSo all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time there best hitter gets up the whole stadium is going over to lose you jerk don't hit the ball get an out and then they clap as he does\nIt make it an energy thrown on that person's\nOh yeah absolutely and that's why the home team is an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their plane to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's going to be added on every other stadium that is not his home stadium\nSo and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players\nWill ... oh yeah ...\nGood a slum or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time and the other thing too it's especially ball players\nLook the dead fans that goes that hang out in stadiums you know you couldn't walk up and stand next to LeBron James at a basketball game\nYou would never get on court the guards and everybody would keep you away her but gee if your ghost who's going to stop you know\nExactly what about the dream state visiting the dad and brother things\nOnce a person
