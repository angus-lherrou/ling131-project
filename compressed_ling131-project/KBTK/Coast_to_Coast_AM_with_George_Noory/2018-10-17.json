special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nOr a movie of course horrible horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just going to\nMake a couple of questions or\nOne would be the first one would be that seems like it was very a scape is more than maybe someone stay back in the sexes so I'm just speculating if you had a job and he came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really life that my second question would be about\nThe mysterious endings which I think a lot of that could be almost a not necessarily ethic book could've unfolded into actual movies additional scenes\nUh where uh someone could take a twilight zone episode and kind of unfold and into an actual movie you know like a planet of the apes\nYeah I I I agree with you on that and and to get to the first question you know the yeah the escapist aspect that as well so I mean that's I think that is part of all science fiction and fantasy of course is that that\nA scape his tone to it or you know it's funny that you mention that because that has actually something that rod Serling are often pointed to about ... gallery ah in the early seventies during the end of the Vietnam\nEra he felt that night gallery was giving people in the ... from the nightly news and seeing you know the stuff on you know stuff on the news about war and everything else that they go into the gallery and escape\nOr through that so he never really said that about the twilight zone but I think is similar to a point can be made about the twilight zone as well\nAnd it is surprising that that that someone hasn't taken you know a twilight zone episode and expanded it into a feature film although there's been there have been plenty of films that are certainly it's twilight zone in ... you know influenced that could very well we'll just as just as well be toilets on movies that are called the twilight zone\nWas it Jack London on one of the twilight zones\nHe's starting for twilight zone yeah actually they actually started a woman feel movie I'm In praise of tip that's right yeah yeah and he was terrific guy jak club and probably gave my favorite performances on the twilight zone in in three of the episodes that he was\nHe was he a trumpet player in one of them\nExactly yes there's one called the passes for trumpeted rod wrote that one and I'll tell you a quick story about that episode you know he the director um\nJak club me was so good in that episode is just so good that the director actually wrote were called rod and said listen I don't want to take the camera off of this guy I just want to keep filming\n[laughter] but yeah there any way we\nCan make this into a two part episode he wanted to expand into an allergist because jak cotton was so good and rod said you know there's some you just can't you don't have the budget we can't can't do more than half an hour but that's that's saying something when director says listen I'm just gonna let this guy going I'm just gonna film whatever does\nLessen classic classic Jason in Portland, Oregon is with us now Jason going to ensure\nWell where are you folks wherever that present day there say why like those radios theater and they take some of the old episode from the radio and they also incorporate date things and have a current topics like a just a couple of weeks ago I heard when they had to do with\nA nano robots eating up um\nSpill in the problem is that the present and I just thought it said and I think with the ... they\nCool did you know about that next\nI I was not aware of the current uh uh uh current radio series no there actually was the twilight zone a series of radio dramas of the original episodes that was produced some not too long ago but no I wasn't aware of of of the current one no\nDidn't write ever writes for radio in his early days\nOh sure yeah that's that's where he really got his start was in radio his first sales were to or where to a series called Grand Central station that air and I think on CBS um CBS network\nAnd he wrote you know for radio or in college and so yeah that was that was the beginning before he broke in and actually the funny thing is he actually went\nBack to radio and created a radio series in Nineteen fifty four so basically four years after she had broken into television he actually went back to work in Cincinnati and created this radio series called it happens to you\nAnd it was a series of Thirteen um original radio scripts\nWhere did he end up living Los Angeles\nA yes or while he once he lived in Los and Pacific palisades for most of his a professional career and then he always went back to\nA if a guy in upstate New York every summer and then he was teaching it if it gets so we kind of gradually spent more time uh and it's like the later in life\nWhen he got sick was a long illness or did you go suddenly\nUm [noise] well it was it was pretty sudden he you know he had\n... years old was any or something like that was fifty\nYeah he was fifty and he had a couple of heart attacks and he went in for a bypass procedure which was fairly you know cardiac bypassed procedure which\nWas and it was in New York at the\nTime uh and you know it's interesting you know how new it was because if you read some of the news stories at the time about the surgery they'll explains you exactly what the surgery is you know they're going to take a ... you know artery from this hearing pleas here it's like nowadays you wouldn't have to say any of that you know what a cardiac bypassed us but that back then it was so\nNew that that explains the surgery and he had the surgery and the doctors thought he was successful and um by the time they were\nShowing 'em up he had another heart attack on the table\nAnd that was pretty much and Steve's with us first time caller in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Hi Steve\nHide your uh I got a little trivia but a ride a uh I live in central New York from Seventy Seventy five and I worked on a military base close Senate garment that bowl we close okay and I would say a big\nA big arts and all that had nuclear weapons are quite a few actually been on the nerd\nA anyway rods home woods about two or three miles from that great\nAnd uh a little town called ... up the road by Mao and a half or two miles with a little courage thought where are you ... where I used to have a ... book and that's where rod you send out yeah\nWhen he he had a a swimming pool built on a property there a couple of miles away right next to the uh bay or early ... and uh I used to talk to the or\nA puppet master kind of like a one room a purge both and I could I I heard rod Serling was around her dad comes and once in a while and I always wish I had met him but I never did\nBut I I think that's where he or a center it's taped to Los Angeles to or the or contrived\nEncouraged a TV program and uh\nYou know he's very here already you know as as I say you lived there right on Lake ... a an ... and that's not not far uh so yeah it could very well be and he would and he would dictate in Ithaca and some of the Senate tapes out to Los Angeles to be to be transcribed\nInteresting Steve what else you know about him what's that what else do you know about it that's cool well\nWhen his career started to think a little bit ah he went back to that area and he taught at a I Believe with Cornell University down there and uh he uh he buried not far from it it's a word conduit than uh\nCemetery called uh inter lake and write on a lake you must love that area and it's white or when they got married they had their honeymoon there ah\nOn the lake or a her ... her relatives parents probably on their property and he bought it eventually and they live there and they always went back there on\nA summer who you are right and relax and die but a funny thing is you do a little radio a promotion or are\nPeople who you know in the area like extreme or whatever might be a store I mean that was kinda cute you hear of locally or\nJust to help him out you know let's just to help 'em out\nYeah absolutely ... and everything ... really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in a sense of your eye he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would have been married things for you know for free for people or people at the college or or local businesses I I mean as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually do and and you know going through his\nCorrespond to see what rod Serling kept everything he ever ever sent ... every letter he ever wrote he kept and they still exist and you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally a personal letters written the sign and

well\nTell us about the rod surely memorial foundation\nI'd love to yeah at some of I'm a member of the board of directors of the foundation and the Binghamton New York based charity or that looks out for a rod Serling as a legacy and and promotes his legacy a in Binghamton or as well as around the world really and working on\nYou know we've done a couple of are we call them Serling fast the last couple of years I'm wary of essentially had a rod Serling convention or people have come and spoken and throwing his daughter and Jodie Serling they've both been you know been there and you know spoke about their dad and\nAnd we've watched rare films and you know had our discussions and radio perform scripts radio scripts performed um so I've had you know done a lot of a lot of things like that for the community\nAnd it's just about keeping rod in the public eye as much as possible and we're trying to at this point we're trying to really get a statue built for 'em and bring him in his home town he loved his hometown a and I come to come across through several twilight zone episodes and so we're trying to get a statue vote for him they were trying to get a rod Serling museum in Binghamton\nSo these are all things that were that were working towards\nGosh I Would love to have had them on the show necklace\nUh I Would love to spend five minutes with him I was five years old when he died so\nIn a class a chance would have been something else what a great interview what about oh yeah oh yeah he always was\nTo the phones we go let's go to Linda ... in Medford, Oregon hello Linda Marie\nMy name is ... and I'm going to kill me\nThat was a classic what am I a favorite episode also the man and the radio or you're talking about me [laughter]\nNo man had found the ... found that radio in ... in the attic uh-huh it played music and shows that only he could hear the plastics and also George I wanted to I wouldn't get paid for 'em how you thought of this show\nI've got a I've ... I've got to give credit to our executive producer Lisa lion and Tom Dan highs are our producers for putting that together\nYes and also make I Want to know um what was the first episode you ... you know that's a it's a funny question because I think most people can tell you for certain what twilight zone episode was the first one is what I cannot tell you for certain what the first one I have a so as\nI could probably narrow it to a couple um hitchhikers is one that I I think it was definitely one of the ... one of the first ones I ever saw but for the ... right yeah going\nMy way and these have been chasing a you know chasing a driver not chasing him and it's just showing up on the road constantly are on the on a road trip on that's a that's a creepy one a rod wrote that one and that was definitely one of the first ones but for whatever reason I I cannot pinpoint it for sure if that's the first one I ever saw\nYou remember the plane that couldn't land in then you we you'd look down and you could see the brontosaurus the dinosaurs and it just it kept going back into time I guess\nYeah it's called the odyssey of flight thirty three and it's about a plane that breaks the breaks the sound barrier and somehow finds itself back in prehistoric times [noise] and uh you know ... you know Ross brother Robert Robert certainly also a very successful writer actually wrote the the president's plane is missing which was a best seller at the time [noise]\nUh and was made into a TV movie um but he was an expert in aviation and he actually a consulting rod consulted with him about that particular episode and other episodes they didn't ever ever and ever had anything to do with aviation he went to his brother ah for advice on those so he actually gonna technical consulting credit on on that particular episode\nNext up we're going to Bradford in the angels camp California Hi Brett heard\nEd Nicholas I'm I'm pretty sure that this was a rod sterling a\nTail it involved what they call the ... guy that was in a capsule um it started with a guy at a bar looking kind of despondent or whatever and and uh\nProbably crying you know trying to give up drinking and somebody came up and gave him a a match but said call this number\nAnd uh so he was curious he called it they said well come over to I think it was going to a place where they gave him this capsule and they said but the the one the one caviar is\nYou cannot drink to get money not drink because he's a message\nThat will um it will\nMake you very very uncomfortable I'll give you a really bad stomach reacting and so what it was was a it was some little organism and it bad on alcohol\nWas dormant unless you drank alcohol in which case it would wake up and then if it would just you know\nCraved the alcohol and make you really really sick 'cause it was growing\nThat's that sounds somewhat familiar it's it's definitely not a Serling I could tell you that for sure but it does sound that that part about it ... it feeding on the alcohol and growing that does sound somewhat familiar to me but it's definitely not necessarily\nThat they were so many classic shows no they all these different messages remember the one where the camera took pictures of the future yeah and you name it at the racetrack bored and you get the winning horse and all that\nYeah yeah most unusual camera it was called and that's one of the you know your\nPrevious caller was talking about a haunted artifacts I mean that camera was an artifact of twilight zone you know they they have plenty of those the you know the telephone that only ... movie was talking about they talked to his grandmother on you know there's always those crops that are where the you know where the Gulf and sort of you know so to speak of the particular episode\nMarion Rock Hill South Carolina hey there\nHello their yard was always a player I ask where he is a God of our ... our love and the ... and so forth but not right and I got to a ... one of my favorite store or Judge Walker that\nHow 'bout that Raj serving as work in those nasty cigarette\n[laughter] it's unfortunate you know he really was addicted he tried to quit several times he just he never never could quite do it\nAll that used to say either here really sick or ... or ... ... a lot of them are just ... you\nKnow you're probably right way too much he would he'd come out on the set smoking Whitney\nOh sure sure it's hard to find a picture of rod Serling where he doesn't have a cigarette in his hand it's just it was it was it was attached to him it was given a constant\nIn those days it was the thing to do I remember dean Martin lighting up on stage of Sammy Davis junior all those people would come out with cigarettes I mean it was it was the thing

something pretty doggone spooky\nI guess you got to be careful with what you do\nWell you know I don't think careful I think that the positive things about antiques as they bring about good spirits a lot of happiness but there are times when you got to pay a little bit careful I knew the warns pretty well and they are used to say don't play around with we gee boards and stuff\nAnd I ... I Believe that\nYeah yeah I don't mess around with really chilly and takes because you know you don't want to open up doors you can't close right [laughter]\nThat's true that is absolutely would you

like\nCaptured animals and skin them and made things out of them [noise] um that was pretty scary when you're the first one to come across these things over the years and that that tends to make all

everything the park because before the but it's a bunch of BS yes I agree with you but\nNow I'm going to tell you what I really think be mindful of the yes button games\nBe mindful of it when others are playing with you and be mindful of it when you are playing with others or even yourself remember people fear actions not your intentions so making all the excuses in the world can't take away from the fact that what people observing you they actually see\nYes I think it's a good idea to not judge people by\nPeople like judge a very deserving of my judgment\nNo way be mindful of the yes about game because if you play it you're merely stating your hypocrisy for all the here for more awareness listen to tackling life my new podcast with NFL legend Ray Lewis\nI don't know but I Know that it's a problem in my mind it equals problem uh and so anyway these are people who have this um ...\nIt's not one of those things where I think you know the headlines that oh disease coverage I'm asking is now but it's something to be aware of something to think about something in your life as you\nKeep yourself healthy think about your health\nI think about your immune system think about how you need to keep it strong by eating the right things and perhaps supplementing to keep that system that is in your body that protects you from getting ill it's weakest in young children and an older people and that's where all of this in this case young children who\nAre three or four years old may not have their immune system enhanced or they become targets for this stuff and then you start to think about some of the other than if you're\nTalking about a Stephen Hawking last half hour some of the great minds that have been able to figure out ways to protect us as human beings from various horrible scourge is\nAnd then you think about disease and and what lives on the planet it back to ... and is there a God he's being these these bacteria these viruses that\nPeople theorize nothing August was one at one time in his career forty years or so ago I remember reading something that he said about humans killing themselves off in the next few centuries and the bacteria and viruses taking ...\nPlanet that's where we live on the planet brew I Can't imagine well yeah I mean look at all of the things that have happened on this planet and the and the billions of years that it's existed what's lived here what's been able to survive here and then when it doesn't survive word comes along next\nIt's really pretty fascinating [laughter] when you get right down to it but there's a lot of ... around including this sort of thing so not\nTo be scared but just keep your eye on it and make sure your immune system in the people in the family and people you love make sure that they have are just the best possible food and the best way of keeping their immune system as strong as possible a simple easy\nAnd pretty awesome when you get right down to it [noise] speaking of awesome today if you're a golfer you'll be celebrating or why they do this\nOctober cause Gulf time is a guess depending on where you are waning\nOff associated with getting a freebie today is national ... day a freebie a pass\nIf you haven't gotten a good golf shot Nashville Molly didn't they apply to any undertaking in which you would care to do over you'd like to do it I'd I'd like to do that again right we've all had those experiences\nWe could do that over again David Mulligan\nConfirmed his reputation or back in Nineteen eighty five fellow who was a journalist named on Macintosh interviewed Mr mode again for a column around the sport circuit was the column David confirmed stories about his additional shots that he took when he was playing golf\nYou go all the way back to the forties the Gulf association claims the term first achieved widespread use however\nMulligan in the thirties uh as far as history in theory is concerned golf historians gave credit to John buddy Mulligan a locker room attending an ethics felt country club in New Jersey for the word\nThat's want it to my dad's played that club that's the heavy yeah\nEthics fails I theory number two going back to the Nineteen twenties David Bernard Mulligan a Canadian golfer one time manager of the Waldorf Astoria in New York would often ask for a second shot off the T he says he coined or some say he coined the term up again but if you go all the way back to Seventeen Ninety three\nWho thought golf went back that far another version of the truth about the ... states that it comes from Thomas ... you know minor Anglo Irish aristocrat and very passionate golfer\nOr people like that are known to cheat I guess [laughter]\n[noise]\nAnyway so if you're a model again person happy Mulligan day you know none of his play golf I think all of this is my father\nMy dad is super into it as he and my mom is into watching it on TV even though the o lay lo or does she says\nA lot of take a nap that's a great where I can now go into it though that I don't get it as a golf channel for God's sakes I imagine they watch the golf channel yes\nAll right speaking of the channel the golf channel rehab television wise but see last night and I'm just trying to think\nWell I think it's worth noting and I are you are you going to watch you can say you watched it and see I asked\nI Know I did not and get back in time I watch other FBI but\nI Do not watch the Connors how was anybody watching\nI did watch it and you know it's interesting I thought that they did a really good job\nOf dealing with such an awkward thing and there are multiple moments during the episode where the family is grieving the loss of Roseanne and ... they they look like very real tears it looks like it was a very emotional very it was for the cast to shoot\n'em parts of it were still really funny I I for me I I was never a fan of the Roseanne show the first time around I don't know it's funny I never thought of me neither but I but the few times that I did see the show I always loved encounter John Goodman character and I always like those aren't lean\nAnd and and I always like the sister Jackie played by Laurie Metcalf and those three are really the stars of the Connors and so I think that I'm definitely gonna keep watching I I saw ...\nGood and it's I think you get\nPeople still tune in I think it has a real chance yeah okay I'd I'd rather than north reduction but good yeah I Know I didn't think I Would be saying that but the other thing that's worth noting Nathan Filene's new show the rookie it's filled trending on Twitter
