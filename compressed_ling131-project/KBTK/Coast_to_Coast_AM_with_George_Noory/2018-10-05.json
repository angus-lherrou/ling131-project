I think it was maybe I don't know if it ... your hand or just hand but they had this very convincing hand crawl embody ham crawling by itself\nAnd I and and um I I I it\nMe so much by ... you know if the rubber hand fake filled with great jelly and manipulating with wires and ... and I'm sure that\nThey usually get wrong but but it put into this perspective a white\nThey're fun they're playing their show this is this is a game you know something can make a make or just torture me this is ... ... fine and I was a common a hawk\nI think from that point forward\nOr I couldn't get enough you know I was a high ... if it were ... and not just for all of you know why I feel is is that under ... I think are under the bigger umbrella of fantasy though uh\nI think the horror or is it an offshoot of fantasy and so it's fine I I like all of that I like uh I like John or movies I like ah you know monsters and\nAnd the robots and engines and pirates and all\nMy dad used to bring me God rest his soul to all these movies when I was a kid I I I remember him taking me to see the Syrians when I was seven years old is too long ago yeah and then of course the scary one for me I was nine years old the house on the haunted deal with the original one with Vincent Price\nRight I mean ... house on how well one of the blind woman and the seller\nMan I thought\nHe would really to all these movies I don't know if he brought me because my mom didn't want to go for [laughter] well when you just wanted me around but\nI mean all these all these movies he would bring me too yeah and then the the TV shows he would love to see\nScience fiction theater in in ... in those kinds of shows right you know you'd have them on all the time I I think he's one of the reasons why my mother is one of the reasons why I got into broadcasting and I'm you know indoor UFOs and the paranormal\n... my dad got me into these movies and all these science fiction shows he loved those things\nWill assure you know and all of those and I think it all ties together you know because I think that curiosity you know I'm just the fact like just like a like a show like Star Trek my you know kind of brought us the cell phones and and uh you know all sorts of things\nYou know I think that the curiosity for this a cult in the supernatural you know I think it is probably the genesis or the speed of a lot of um your your guests on your show who who started watching these uh\nMovies in and decided to go hey let's dig deeper what you know are there goes let's find out\nI think so too what do you think of the Texas Chainsaw massacre Nineteen Seventy four mirage\n[noise] you know the the Texas Chainsaw massacre gifts has had the heaviest wrap everyone was trying to do the Texas Chainsaw massacre there is hardly a drop of blood in that whole movie\nYou think there is you think there is I think\nThe area is why you know and you could go back and you watch it\nAnd you know it's all still murky sixteen millimeter and the chainsaw and the the how weird their house was with all the\nThe mode mobiles made out of bones and you know the the psychological aspect is really what clicked with that movie and I think that everyone that what came after it those are really I think they're really sloppy slap dash\nYou know a bunch of teenagers waiting to get slaughtered kind of movies but really as the original Texas Chainsaw as they were they were they were heartbroken when they got an R rating they were trying to get a PG E because there was no one was going to go see it\nThe Nineteen sixty Alfred Hitchcock movie psycho Lou shower scene you would think yeah you were looking at ... moons every second not won a stabbing did you see in that shower saying\nNo no no point does the knife a entered Janet Leigh body at any point uh you\nYou are you there you know what's happening but you don't see\nThat the sounds I think out a lot of that and there were a bunch of other ... there were a bunch of ... Mellon that they had laid out and they were stabbing different types of melons\nAnd Hitchcock is standing there spoke in his chair and watching the sound guy you know making all these weird hollow strange down stabbing all these different fruits and vegetables [laughter] ... that was gonna say a word in Athens walking out the door he just says Christopher\n[laughter] Blair Witch project started with pennies but that was a scary one to\nBlair Witch project is really interesting because you know a a you know they were uh unfortunately I had a friend who was ushered when a when that movie came out and he was cleaning up vomit every single night job he couldn't handle it cause and it wasn't because it was scary\nIt was because people hadn't had a become accustomed to the found footage first\nPerson you know just a just a handy cam or a camcorder filming a whole movie um you know so uh you know that was kind of the first of the sort of found footage type film\nAnd an independent film that went really big and you know and it's like okay well you can say what you want about that movie but\nYou know that in that movie was a that was the director had final cut and they made the movie they way the way they wanted to make it and they created this whole legend that much more I mean I live in Pennsylvania not far from a where the Blair Witch supposed to happen and people still\nDrive in they're looking to uncover this thing that never happened so they read a really great job of not only are making a a a found footage film but but creating a a a a story that people want it to believe in and uh you know you talk nowadays I think I'd be hard to do\nBecause of the Internet it gives you can't keep a secret for twenty second but in Nineteen Ninety nine a fool with everybody everyone thought the Blair Witch was the thing\nWhat did you think of Freddie Krueger nightmare on elm street\nYou know it's interesting I didn't like it when I saw it originally uh you know it just it was kind of just greedy and\nCame out in Nineteen eighty four right\nAny for but you know I I've gone back and there's a lot of humor in it and and it's very marriage that said you know he's not just stabbing people going into their dreams\nUh which I think they pretty liberally ripped off from the movie dream skate which I became the year before which is an excellent movie that people should seek out where someone is trying to assassinate the president inside of his dream right uh but uh yeah ... it's actually very clever movie and and uh\nWas any any of them were never they\nGo five six seven equals yet they're getting pretty bad\nThere was a movie out two thousand fourteen I never saw I just got a weird movie it shows up as one of the horror films have you ever heard of the ... do [noise]\n[noise] yes I have you know and I did not like the bother to pretty much did it's an Australian film I Believe uh it's about I'm\nA mother and a her child [noise] and uh they are basically kind of dealing with the grief a of a loss of of a spouse or or and father um and I think it's manifested in this\nIn this creature that kind of comes alive from a children's storybook which kind of looks like London after midnight you know he's got like a top hat and kind of ... kind of hair and he's a cartoon out of a children's book uh I didn't really I mean it it didn't\nI never really believe the topic do but that wasn't the part of that is why I didn't like that it seemed like a two hours don't walk commercial where it was just running this [laughter]\nThis this allegory for their depression and their grief and that you you don't ever really escape your review just have to feed it\n[noise] what is it about horror and creepy films that people generally like to be scared\nUm you know I think if you you serve you won I think there's two there's two aspects to roller coaster you know there's two kinds of roller coasters you want to ... you get on it right you get on a roller coaster and you have so much fun but you want to get\nKinda roller coaster is when you get off your kissing the ground [laughter] in after a while to get on the roller

safe and then you feel like you've overcome something and I think that it's just that that Russia I think it's just that thrill\nAnd and again I think it's ... for a moment there it makes you forget all the really thing real things in real life that really do terrified and I think that that that's worth the price of admission by so\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn

I think it's a horror movie has too much money at it\nIt seems protected you know you look at the second Terminator movie you know if if it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one 'cause there's just too much money and it feels like a franchise\nSo um you know a horror film\nYou know you almost need to cap the budget because if you put too much money and do it it's ... like a surprise and and if you eat and eat the train coming down the track\nNo one is going to knowing shouting blue is going to scare you you know so you it has to kind of be a slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think that's why a lot of low budget horror films like\nNeither the living dead ...\nGrand a are incredibly scary [noise] and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell have made a living doing lower budget horror films\nAbsolutely yeah he's like the Olivier\n[laughter] really is\n[laughter] and uh you know and and I you know I got to interview him and he was charming guy and uh you know he uh he loves ah you know he pretended he doesn't like it but he he he likes it he likes the attention he likes the than\nHe likes to check\nThe likes of paycheck absolutely you know and ah I'm evil dead is a is a great a film for an actor I mean he pretty much just carrying that whole movie on his back he's putting himself through\nA you know all of these ... it's almost like a chaplain where it's just it's huge just following women through all of these tap blows that they've created for him so it's you know ... not too many actors can can carry a whole movie on their back\nWhat do you think of the Stephen King movies from his books that all seemed to have that feeling for in\nA cemetery in things like\nThat yeah yeah I mean I I like Stephen king's films a lot more than the books I mean but I mean I'm a film guy you know people always say oh well the book was better it's like they're not exchange commodities you know I mean like Dan is different than a sculpture\nYou know ... book is different than a movie or just you know when you're in the mood for a movie you you you're not in the mood to read a book and vice versa and uh\nYou know what works in a book doesn't work in a movie and I I I think that a lot of my favorites Stephen King stuff is all the short stories I think his novels or to a padded too long winded you know\nWhat I understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met the man but you know he doesn't know where the story ends when he starts he just he just keeps righty he he's the just as surprised as we are because\nHe just keeps writing a and drinking and writing and ... finished you know and and then uh you know five hundred pages later it's done so\nThere's NO PLAN going in ... which I think allows for him to the ... you know again ... there there was no formula so I think that I think that that's why\nHis books are so surprising but I think if the same time [noise] you know a good director can kind of oil back down to its asked them you know he hated the film the shining and the film is shining I think stands as one of the best pieces of art you know the twentieth century so\nI don't know what about TV shows that are dealing with ... like the walking dead and things like that\nUh yeah it's interesting because you know I mean ... that's the way I feel like oh everything's right or the living yes and you know now it's kind of come down to the main street I'm Down to the front line you know you go into a Walmart is either [laughter] you know\nOr the rubber ears that you're hanging around your neck or the you know the whatever getting by the signs and you know it it's all um\nIt's a very commercial\nUm you know I think that uh you know to sell 'em and I think it's kind of cowboys and Indians to work that I'm In modern zombie movies you know I Know ... years the animals that you can shoot and not go out\nAnd we don't have you know we're we're in the world of revert politically correct world\nThere there there aren't many a screen\nVillains that you can kind of indiscriminately um shoot down mowed down with a gun and it has no uh we you know a repercussion\nRepercussions we're going to come back and take some final phone calls and I'm all about what Mr local ... give out a couple of your Web sites\n[noise] uh yes cinnamon Saudi or dot com and aware five Seventy four dot com\nAnd we've got that linked up for all of the U.S coast to coast am dot coms so stay with us those have you on hold will do the best we can to get up to all of you when we come right back on the coast to coast and the next hour we begin to talk with Dr Merrill Lynch blitz about the other side life after death\nYou know her latest book is called death makes life possible how 'bout that so we'll be back in a moment to funnel calls with Mr ... on the coast to coast and you\nSign up no for coastal zone or free email newsletter did it today at coast to coast am dot com\nDot com and download ... absolutely and I do go to U.\nT.

that I don't know that I feel that way but Barbara Streisand although I don't agree with anything that she says politically I just find or it may more\nI may agree with or actually politically and some stuff it just bothers me and and maybe the nuance of what I'm saying didn't come across Victoria\nI don't like it when people have that stride and I'm the smartest guy in the room and you need to believe me otherwise you're a moron I don't I don't that doesn't I don't find that attractive er appealing of dust I shut that off or turn it out or go away\nOr from the conversation that's basically a wire put those are specially joy they are\nAbout whom uh when I first met her I had a great admiration for her that she was\nFunny and such but she's just turned into this angry angry angry woman\nAnd there's nothing that you see or hear from her does anything other than than the horror show the right as a horror show\nRaise any more of our show than the left depending on where you're coming from but it's that kind of stuff that we've created it seems are allowed to be created this uh this whole sense of\nI'm smarter than you are I'm right you're wrong you don't believe me then you know screw you that kinda stuff never fixes anything and that's a lot of what when and I go back to the law of attraction that is one of the reasons that things are messed up as they are because we keep holding on to this um right you're wrong\nIt isn't the case that you are right and I'm wrong all the time sometimes I'm right sometimes I'm wrong sometimes you're right sometimes you're wrong and I'm not even to be about that it ought to be about OK what\nCan we agree upon where do you see that in any of these conversation\nI think I don't have to find their point on it when I think you're trying to say is when people have\nWhen people say claims instead of introducing a conversation about important stuff I think that you personally see that as a turn off there are a lot of people who like to consume media yeah I Know people who know exactly what they're saying they want to stay in their stride and that's why they have people follow them\nBut I think you are more like not to say you're more like a woman but I think\nFemales can stay on the air a lot of people I heard all females no matter if they agree with the person or not that have a hard time dealing with listening to people who are very strident on the radio and so I think we want to you're inclined to want to have a conversation that more than someone who just says well that's that's how it is a matter of ... and that that\nWell that would make sense to me\nIt was and I just I tried to cover that try to get out of that okay [laughter]\nThank you so ...\nThat we used to have that sometimes it is today\nWe celebrate world teachers' day worldwide event launched by the United nations\nThe organization for education science and culture called UNESCO goes back to Nineteen Ninety four\nChances are that you

years ago education quality goals set sustainable government goals adopted by the un achieving quality education becomes a their number four go I think that there's an interesting how you define quality here\nI'm not sure that we all think in our country anyway there were getting a quality education I think in some I've been asked to join\nA local school board and I went to the school yesterday ... school I Believe varies sound or they broke his nose ... and very necessary part of public school education and so I went through the school with the superintendent\nAnd looked around and uh it's really cool that there is so much going on here their school days longer they're more focused they get their basically going through two systems instead of one they have one week of classes from seven in the morning until four in the afternoon three something\nAnd then they have one week or being in the shop learning how to\nDo whatever it is a there's a cosmetology ... said again to cause myth cosmetology is that the that yeah that area yeah uh that I was fascinated to [laughter] see how these women and men mostly women are learning how to uh do what you do in a in a
