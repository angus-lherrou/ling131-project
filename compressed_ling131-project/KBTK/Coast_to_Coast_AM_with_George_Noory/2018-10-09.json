effect of technology in the workplace and on society as well he writes books that explore the wonders of the world of tomorrow and delights audiences all over the planet with his vivid presentations on the future of work in life\nAnd here he is on the coast to coast looking for love your cover on this book by the way by run\nWell thank you very much and thank you for having me\nSo a lot of people are concerned that the world of robots is going to take over the planet take take our jobs and do everything else\nIs that something for us to be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people's jobs\nBut um other tests to my website you take to try to figure out if it's your job is at risk and it it records all the answers and very very few jobs actually could have robots\nTake over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or any of the thousands of other things people do and and and that\nAre so no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think we build these tools\nIncrease our own productivity and we were all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence or exactly what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[noise] well that's a great question you know what is it is is more complex than you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means but what what they what people mean by the time or two very different things that may have nothing\nIn common so they either me or what'd you see in the movies so commander data upstart truckers see three arena or a that would be an a machine that can do everything a person can do it's created it can teach itself new things and we don't\nWe don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and\nThat's called a general intelligence or\nIt is a computer program that could do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic and now we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it and make projections about the future and that doesn't sound all that interesting\nBut that's in essence of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are foster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things that really look\nSmart um by just using the simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just curl us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we used to all have some amount of privacy\nOr just based on the fact that there are so many others can't follow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation unfortunately with artificial intelligence the kinds of tools were developing to do very good thing it was like ... cancer or something like that\nCan be used to to to to follow people voice to the to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded\nAnd it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans that reading list so every camera even if it doesn't have audio can read lips as well as a human um\nYour you know you have a a device that tracks where you are and they get all of these things ended up themselves aren't bad technologies but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile\nIn the world um you know China has implemented a kind of a social score yeah that's right you\nWrite run a red light you lose a point if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and if you if you get a low enough you don't fly on airplanes anymore you don't um\nAnd and you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't have\nAny may not even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are uh have the capability of of of being misused of course hopefully it in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nGovernments that do you have a Republican but this governed by laws the price of liberty is a turtle vigilance and so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and enforced\nThat don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nByron is every tell them telephone conversation smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even the Ninety nine percent of them were probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I just couldn't say the technology is at a point where they could decipher you know what what\nThat many people are saying and then it can uh it doesn't have to understand it and the way the human understand something that decides to look for patterns and combinations of words along with um\n... and and and just kind of Bill Bill obstruct profiles on people I mean all I'm saying is is it is it is it a potential way to use this technology which can be\nTo do so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand or a let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about bombing or something and the computer you know is is set up to pick up code words like bomb ... or whatever\nAnd so it finds this uh on one hand it's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy\nOn the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian ... by run in terms of if it's OK or not\n[noise] well it is it and it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have the suicidal consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know\nThe federalist papers that addressed that topic uh no that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAll right well stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Reverend Reese with us his book is called the fourth age we're talking a lot of high technology folks and what it does his website is his name linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com we'll be back in the moment don't touch you\nNever miss a detail on a show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com\nA well\nI I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about was what we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain is a machine and your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time\nThat will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my probably cost about ... I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking central question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country\nDoesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build a mechanical ... if you don't think human beings\nAre just machines then no than a machine could never do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work the way it does just with chips and the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of ... brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering who really is um\nThe thing is is that when a computer can play chess and when the computer complete go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things\nIs it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really isn't quote anybody home there's nothing there but does any thinking at all it's it's one was in the rose manipulated in memory turned on and off\nOr at the speed of light um it's done with which relative it it's interesting the techniques we use for it official intelligence we'd been writing about for forty years since just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere is a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem and it's about ... it goes like this series is\nThere's this rumor or that's full of these books and there was a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese people outside the route slide questions written in Chinese under the door\nTo this Chinese to this librarian the librarian picks\nThem up looks at the first character on the question goes and finds a book with out on the spine looks up the second character that sentence him to another book to another book to another book to another book until it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these\nSymbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since perfect and so the question is does\nDoes the library and understand Chinese\nAs it does the library and understand Chinese ... to to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense but to a lot of people\nKnow they'll librarian doesn't know if they're talking about Colorado coffee beans and the analogy is an after one because that's all the computer does it runs a set of determining ...\nProcesses in memory it spits out an answer and it doesn't know it's playing chess it doesn't know any what he's talking about it doesn't know anything and so you kinda have to ask is the computer thinking or not it does the computer understand anything or not\nOr by my way of looking it doesn't it doesn't understand anything but other people\nOther people say if it can do everything that that's something that doesn't understand can do then you just have to say it does\nIt is just mind boggling and it's getting even been or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers do this thing where in a very simple short and they double in power\nEvery couple of years but on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's Fifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can I collect data\nThere'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all of those you know you have all this data coming in and these foster computers and so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it if\nYou think about it the Internet the mosaic browser cannot twenty five years ago a literally in Ninety three and all that did was like computers talk to each other and that was hit and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars in well a\nMillion new businesses it up in ... I mean it did everything that the imagine a technology that effectively makes everybody smarter than\nThey were before you go to bed tonight everybody on the planet wakes up with ten more IQ points that is going to be more transformative then the mere Internet which just connected a bunch of machines together this this is machines think\nReason will they show emotion Byron\n\nThat is an open question a it is even an open question whether you want them to\nI don't I'm not sure I Want them to\nSo the first question is do you want them to simulate emotion\nA there is there's a couple of different sides to that you know I have a desktop device that I talked to and I\nInterrupt it and I tell it to stop in a way I wouldn't do a person um you had you had student you had kids in Japan and there was a a robot they let loose in the mall and these little kids would bother would beat it\nAnd the robot learned benefit\nSaw a bunch of short people kids without a tall person around an adult it needed a run off to a tall person because the\nKids would abuse it now when I asked later the kids said they thought it was feeling distress so they even felt like it was internalizing it you wonder about\nAbout a kindergarten teacher you know that the robotic that\nUh the raising children on fake empathy and you you you just start with that do you even want them to have human voices is that\nThe noble the machines somehow or just you know we've had the car away to these things called human rights a to a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do to any human being\nBecause there's something special about a human being and and do we kind of want to make things look like humans that we do abuse and throw into a scrap heap and and and destroy without\nA second thought that it suddenly having nothing effect on people now the question can they\nFeel emotion a that is an open question we we have we have something called consciousness which is that we experience the world we feel wants a computer measures\nTemperature that difference whatever that is that you feel the warmth of something\nComputer right now we don't think or\nCan we can measure temperature and even if you make a program that plays a person screaming at the temperature gets over five hundred degrees nobody believes that computer feels that\nPain nobody believes that ... ... or ... now the interesting thing is we wouldn't know it if I'm\nIf they did really well you wouldn't know if a treat pain and you share half your DNA with the with the tree you should know DNA with a computer and so we wouldn't really even know if they ever if they ever developed a emotions\nAnd even if they claimed that they did that could just be in a way of program running that you know the the the program reasons that it can can achieve whatever objective it launched by making this claim I'm so\nIt it's an open question it it all boils down to do you think of motions in the end are mechanical I mean our our ... again it's a punch you back to the original question are we machines and therefore our experience of emotion is just something mechanical\nWhat happens in these machines Myron go rogue and they started doing things to watch to screw up our lives on purpose\nWell\nI'm\nA little like hell from two thousand once the sun\nI mean look if it ever happened uh we're completely vulnerable of course\nYou know if there were eighty billion devices attached to the Internet you know smart other news just tired of all on and override their safety protocols I mean there are so many ways a malevolent machine would want to um would be able to inflict harm\nThe the interesting and and so you kinda have to say what would that happen and it can happen in one or two scenarios either through\nGrabbing the machine just does that it doesn't have any intent at all um\nOr kinda machine somehow develop goals of its own that are different than ours and her perhaps in conflict with ours and and pursue those goals against those they're um they're open questions I mean right right now though\nOh see sunshine Wednesday the high temperature sixty seven\nNow we're

inaction allow a human being to come to harm to a robot must obey orders given to us by human beings except for such orders would conflict with the first law\nThree a robot must protect its own existence is longest such protection does not conflict with the first or second law so what he's saying is is robots can't injured human beings at any cost\nThat is kind of like in conflict with they all of you know soldiers that are robotic\n[noise] yeah yeah that's true\nTrue you know the the the laws are are\nA literary device so he can tell a story they don't actually get us very far um

ghost photographer I loved the subtitle of course is interested in ... were you talking about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world would make believe [laughter] it's coming true isn't it\n[noise] it it it it definitely is coming true it it it was funny I um when I was sitting with my publisher she was asking me about some of my photographs and I said you know some of the creatures and then that I that I get and these photographs looked like they ... out of movies that I've marketed\nAnd she goes\nOh my gosh you're living like the real world of may leave I sit isn't that crazy during the day I'm and make believe and then at night\nYou comes true it comes [laughter]\nHave you ever gone to the point where you were scared or you felt threatened\nYes I did what happened will times yeah you know and we can start going weird hair in a minute if you want to because some of the things I encountered um are are strange and some are scary and you know I found\nTimes um and and this is where the Claire sent in really that that gift comes in to comes in very handy um where I can feel\nAnd if there is a ... a bad entity and evil entity that is around and I learned something really important for folks that to understand um and that is if you if if they find themselves\nWhere they have a ghost in their house and they feel like they've encountered something and they they feel that fear and their body all they have to do\nIs\nBe in charge because they are in charge because it's the fear that they're looking for and so if you stand there and go get out of my house you are not allowed in here believe\nYou can you say you can use any of the tools that you want that to exert your human dominance like dominance like you you can get rid of a seven like that\nThat's what I found because I started clearing people's homes and I started weirdly because I get my Oklahoma I've ... upbringing I was raised in ... and so I knew the Lord's Prayer had used it for really long time\nUm and does it work for you\n... what's really interesting is that's another way that I could find if there were um you know dark ferrets around that I Would start saying though like I started saying lord for over and over and if any point in time I forget or I spam or there's something there\nYou're like a magnet it's kind of well maybe [laughter] ...\nUsually all our tell you the truth is that while I was gonna say do you think everybody has this capability that you have ... or ... or are you unusual\nYou know I think that we are all born\nWith different gift that we're able to tap into yes\nI have a friend that is the most incredible medium evil ever meet in your life and the specificity of the messages that she gets from the other side are detailed as addresses that you've lived in in your life\nWhen\nBy the number of into the street name so I think everybody has something different you know it perhaps I have you know a few weird capabilities and and the and in the world so yeah I think probably I Do\nYou actually because you're into of course media in a big way ... you Google ghost when you were experiencing this how come\n\nYou know I think any time you encounter something new in your world right in your have you have the kind of your reality you want to see a you want to know you're not the only one\nAnd I think I was looking to see\nHow common are uncommon rights to physically the photograph did you get the answers um\nI started to I started to understand and that's when I started to actually talk about it after that and it was the talking about it that really kind of eased my nerves and then [laughter] and then of course I turn to movies\nAnd there are some really fabulous movies that are based on true accounts and one of them is that movie the witch and\nDid you do you have and see the which I have not seen you haven't seen that there's a scene in which it it was based on the Salem witch trials like before the sandwich shop\nAnd I'm\nDavid ... who is the kind of friend advise the producer and and he did a lot of work at the New York public library pulling you know original pamphlet from back in the day and there's a scene where the father\nOr the and families circled around I'm the son who is um a possess and he says everybody must say the Lord's Prayer\nSo they'll start saying the Lord's Prayer then the two twins are saying it and then they fall on the floor and kind of start shaking\nUm because there was a there was a uh like uh\nEvil entity that was around and I later talk today about he's like oh yeah that's the Lord's Prayer is how it was like a\nDefining rod to find them you know\nAnd and I'm like oh my gosh that's been happening to me\nSo it's weird how things happen without instructions I think that's a really interesting part about all of this\nIs that all this just started happening to me and there was no instruction bucks [noise] you know I was able to identify were ghost were I was able to figure out how to you know get them out of his space I'm I was able to figure out how to you know help other humans\nUm protect themselves and you know big thing I learned a lot about sleep paralysis\nYou know ... ... ...\n... well it was just like the syndrome\nI did for a little bit on this while he was he could be medical it could be could be\nPeople have woken up here relies basically because they can't lose in the room and then you realize that you you you are where you can get out of it but I've also heard of the ... were you basically Pearl one\nYeah what I've heard what I read about and well actually what I I experience I I didn't personally experience it um but I have a very close friend and this is how it all started that he was telling me histories of sleep paralysis and um and there's a an entity called the ... man\nYes you don't mind the whole ...\nI I I'm a a friend and her and Facebook and I read her book I think Rudy is tremendous and expert on the house she\nAbsolutely is and she is where one of the places I went to very quickly when my friend Alex started telling me about what he was experiencing\nUm and what's interesting also is that I'm a nightmare on elm street you know created by Wes Craven\nUm a friday right um he had\nWes Craven um had fleet paralysis and he modeled Freddie Krueger based on that man\nBecause it came to him that's right and nightmares right so what was interesting\nWith Alex is um I I did a lot of research I I read Heidi's books I talked to friends um and one thing that I've also gotten into is I'm a crystals and stones and rocks and I I've taken classes and I'm even now a certified transmissible therapist so I\nDo this stuff in the big when I started\nTo yes I Am I mean I mean if you're going to go go big George don't just take a few pictures that go send me go all the way\nThrough [laughter] you know ...\nRight and and also to serve others because that's really where the turn happened\nI learned about this stone called black terminally and black term lane is a really powerful rock it is not the prettiest rock in their purse booking them but it's really a powerful and it and it actually holds a charge an electric charge\nJust sitting on the counter [noise] um it's been studied by the juries and also by Benjamin Franklin so the stone has been\nA lot of curiosity surrounding it and it's also been used you know by magicians in those just like you know clear their space back in the day so on and so forth Sean and use it and um and I know what to protect us down so I said to my friend Alex

people really uncomfortable because so many people actually believe in aliens that just don't believe they're here\nAnd I was asked the other day it's like well do you actually believe I said how can how can I not how can I not believe you know it it was in my backyard\nI Wonder if these movie characters'\nThese movies you dealt with or coming alive\nWell she does have a different philosophy what if it's possible that those that are actually making the movies are seen them themselves what Walt Disney saw all of those creatures that he put in his movies\nWhat I call them fantastical that's what I use the word and then create you know then created them when he saw them they should\nThey be creating money some I Know what is that what if this is an has nothing to do with me what is that they

says that Americans are polarized\nNow that we've never been this polarized in our history\nHow 'bout that now that is I Know they said if you could it I mean I think we feel that's right and we all feel that\nBut new pulling out Jay yesterday or earlier in the week I think said that that people politically are more separated than at any time in our history and they cite the late sixties early seventies at the time when that\nPolarization it really took hold of our country and we've been moving I guess in this direction\nAh for for years now for a decade and so I was going to ask you that because obviously the ladies and they're just a little bit too young and it's not a comment on age ... yeah no this is not it it just like just to really ask you a serious ... okay\nBelieve and bad with and therefore it that our country started doubting the government and started to become more polarized after the death of John F.

A. L. O. T. R. E. N. Calif Trenton it get it by going to top last dot com\nBut you know there was no yeah but see statistically here's the thing that that kind of bugs me that's not being talked about statistically one in three women is a victim of sexual assault now that's what the numbers are in America and that's reported sexual assault so we ... you could say that it's probably more than that but\nOnly for any one hundred\nMales are falsely accused so if you think about those numbers when when I hear Trump and all these other male blow hards talking about that one senator who posted the champagne glasses congratulating Brett saying oh it's not beers for ... years for Brett champagne will have to do\nMaking fun of the fact that you know Kevin said he liked beer and\nIt's still very much the old boys' network that's happening in Washington and there's still down and talk about but to hear them talk about the poor males who were being accused you know that's the only four out of one hundred\nThat are ever accused falsely but one in three at least women are actually sexually assaulted the number we we have to stop focusing on\nThe poor men who were accused yes it's terrible if someone's falsely accused of course no one's endorsing that but we really need to look at the real problem it's the guys who are actually sexually assaulting women\nAnd that's that's where as a woman I get really frustrated well and I'm getting hired here in men going oh well poor Brett Kavanaugh what he went on to a doctor ward I got it what about all the other women\nSo there is that to be sure\nAnd there is the the the the conversation if that's what it is is it getting us some place or not is it action or talk\nThey were looking for I'm looking for action I'm not looking for talk I'm done with the talk I'm done with listening to all these people and their BS whether it's this jerk with champagne and beer these comments that are showing sensitive that are so and\nThat are you know it's the typical up yours I'm In charge and you're not that doesn't work it and it it will not work\nBut there is the the the ... that has come over our country part of it and and you know this is not about fixing the blame of fixing the problem but there's a mole lays there is an acceptance\nFor a long time lots of these judges like the judge that we talked about and a stand for the case of that kid that to get off got away with raping a that it was just the whole thing so stunk at the stench\nAround that judge in around that kidding around his father and around that whole incident\nWhich is very indicative in my opinion very indicative of the sort of thing that does go on that tries to the people try to bury so the the population that community took action\nThey got rid of the judge that was a very ... yeah exactly right so the conversation has gone on\nA not long enough but in this particular instance this particular case there is nothing more they can come out of it\nIt's it's it's trying to educate the people and uh that that starts at the youngest level that starts at home and so many families are broken today there isn't a good strong positive male and female and it's a representation at home\nOr especially in the minority community and so what these kids grow up around people who may or may not have a good background but they influence them and so\nThere's a whole we can keep digging and digging and digging to find the problem and the solution maybe as one step at a time there has been certainly a lot of positive action that has come out of this in terms of the protests and that sort of thing\nBut in the particular incident that we're talking about I think we've struggled with this\nI Would like it if you are not there but he is and so are we going to spend all of our time and energy trying to get him out of the Supreme Court\nOr am I going to try to figure than him it is ... right yeah and that and that's\nI understand that that you know the women's march is going to arrive at court today and his first day of protest I get that and I'm all for protesting I'm I'm more like you know I I Want to see some results\nAnd the problem is that we can't ... you know when we say believe survivors we have to believe survivors because there's an entire generation of young girls who watch doctor for testify just like the generation before who watched Anita Hill testify nothing happened it didn't change anything\nThat sets such a bad example for women who don't come forward later on because they've seen those examples where do we deal with I I usually on the far right now I I'm not that I think\nThere is I think there is a difference between Anita Hill and the circumstance\nThey or their results are basically the same but I think a lot of things have happened with me too movement and some other things that have been generated a they were slow to come as a result of the hill and there were a lot of people who still you can poke holes in either side if any argument just go to a\nCourt room for a day and listen to the trailer watch some of the court dramas on TV uh you can see how things you can find in friends in in your window and but you gotta have proof in order to make\nChange see that's the problem though so many of these cases are it and people in a room\nI Know people in a room you can't ... if he said she said but the ... the the real problem no it's not just poking holes in whose side of the story it it's it's just the precedent that it sets of having a look at the all those gymnasts when aren't there three hundred\nFemale Jim ... yeah the virus was live yeah yeah almost every one of them had reported his sexual assault to the shower hire their ... you have somebody else and nobody did anything but what happened way\nPeople after that fact that they're all those people get fired and they should have been if they weren't I Want to know if those people\nWill ever connected to Larry Nassar apparently has been fired but look at how many years it took\nYou know how many years it took for that and all those girls who came forward hundreds of them and it and it and it wasn't until the me too movement that really pushed it into the spotlight and people said All right we can't ignore this anymore it's a systemic problem it's green court if in college campuses across the country it's it's such a much bigger problem than Brett Kavanaugh\nFor that is very true but again back to the action and what we can do that is positive to be a focused on changing so we work at it but I'm gonna I'm just off of a cabinet I'm tired of listening to the conversation\nIsn't going to make it a lot of noise going to the Supreme Court to they're protesting\nA isn't going to do a damn good uh I I'm with you and you hear me talk about this all the time on the air I Want to have I Do like protesting protesting has a lot of value but at this point the protest all of the information\nHas been heard everybody's been hurt on this pretty much all sides all angles a\nRight but likely go ahead no doubt that the people that got\nWell I just think that we've ... we've exhausted we're getting exhausted emotionally\nPhysically or I think you know I Know people who have\nBeen so upset about this they physically gotten ill\nUm I wouldn't be surprised you don't feel that well and I wouldn't be surprised if some of it is the emotion that has worked its way in coal catered itself into your psyche and you know it's the mind spirit mind body connection in your mind is on something and it upset you than it affects you physically\nOr I think that it has affected a lot of people physically and emotionally um but as sadly it's a it's not the worst case of this women have gone through this and they've been killed\nAs a result of these some of these altercation so\nUh just as we have a sickness is a mental health side to this that we are not we're not dealing with mental health issues in this country at all when you have a problem with gets done squat\nOr and so we spend all this money on weaponry we're going to be the biggest toughest guys on the block it's you know we are able to blow the world up above Seventy times over so I always been some of the money uh and and uh and place it in a in a position or in some\nUse that has value or to help us become a healthier\nCountry instead of this is very this these things are very difficult on our mental health uh\nWell they are and you know I don't I'm not a parent but if I if I had a daughter heading off to college I Would be pretty scared these days you know there's we we just I don't know if we talked about it on the show but I Know a couple of weeks ago that the devices the head of the education department\nShe just rolled back some some ah some regulations that were there and that were put in place to protect girls on campus and off campus if they are sexually assaulted now she wrote it back and it's no longer if you're off campus the school has no obligation to protect you\nEven an off campus housing that's part of the school it's still if you're sexually assaulted\nThen you you know you can go to the local police and see what that does but there's no you have no recourse with your own school if\nYou're already know that a lot of threats against her life she's now upped her so why would it\nBe turned around to doing for even funny\nIt's another person that you've never been there All right so we've got to move on a it is very valuable and we continue to focus on it but we got to focus on other things like whether or not you've got a
