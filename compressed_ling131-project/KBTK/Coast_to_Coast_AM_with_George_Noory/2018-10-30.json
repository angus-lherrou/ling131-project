profound demographic shifts the head and can there are many shifts aren't there\nAre tons it's overwhelming it just doesn't stop have you been very well so how are you\nI'm good here everything's good and the you know but if we can take key to some of the things you told us a year ago and things are going to tell us tonight we might be able to get through some of this\nYeah we'll get through and I sure hope so I I have ever conflict where do you think of Amazon crushing bricks and mortar stores\nYeah you know you say crushing the Amazon or you know online retail is about ten percent of total retail if not crushing anything\nIt said cheers was cabinet anachronism anyway you know ... the the retailers that are having problems right now are having problems because they're having you know their their their model is not correct not because of Amazon\n... do you think they should've adjusted that they could have prevented some of the things that have happened to them like toys R. us and all the other places\nOh yeah oh for sure yeah toy cigarettes makes me crazy you know I I started um um\nYeah I bet if you follow Toys R us on in the wall Street Journal in you know it's it's sexually gone now and now an Mattel as a hired their fourth\nCEO in four years fourth CEO and four years why because the CEOs that they hire can't come up with the magic sauce to a reverse the the sales decline of of a hot wheels and Barbie dolls\nYou know what the real problem is that what you have what they say and the already read the wall Street Journal article just a few months ago that said that the uh kids now are so enthralled with their phones the iPhones that they're no longer a you know they don't want to have any consideration for\nHot wheels are Barbie dolls the real problem is there are fewer kids about twenty five percent fewer kids under ten now than there were ten years ago you think maybe just maybe that has something to do with their ... their sales decline\nAnd that could be it could have makes me crazy\nYou know I was seriously if you have a twenty five percent decrease in the size of your market I don't care if you're if you're in General Motors or or Amazon or your you know your sales are going\nTo decline it it they're just they weren't on they don't exist\nYou know they don't but how do you look into a crystal ball can make these predictions if you're running a business\n... ... ... what you do is is uh\nLook into a crystal ball can make these predictions if you're running a business\n[noise] yeah what you do is is it the what's the most important question for any business any business you know I I I was um\n[noise] I had an opportunity to speak to the chief marketing officer in the hospitality industry about two years ago and and everyone was there see it at a shark him as their Hilton was there and Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with the hospitality industry\nAnd I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now and and uh you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room there was about twelve people in the room and sitting around and round table and\nAnd they eat their answer was you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how to market on social media\nAnd and the American express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation why a ... you know how they think how they buy and Hilton says it's it's about new products it's about making your room smaller and your lobbies bigger\nYou know what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it's all about demographics isn't it\nYeah is it because if your market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market but you know it it for about Twenty years they could make their product fast enough\nThey literally couldn't meet the demand and all of a sudden sales started trailing off this was Nineteen\nNinety eight and I and I said a\n... so your your sales are ... are are going fat and he said yeah what do we have a demographic issues as to the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis and and I said a\nHoosier customer and he's got an Eighteen to thirty four year old man or woman Eighteen to thirty four and I see what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he said what we can they don't fit in the product anymore\nI say you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes I said the last baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said it was a pause and he said Nineteen\nNinety eight and I said we're in it and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he said what does that mean is it what that means is you know you're you're laughing gas just checked out of your hotel and their their sales went from eight billion get this George eight billion to two and about three years while why because they're not paying attention to demographic\nYou know if you want to count money count money go ahead knock yourself out but\nIf you want to understand where money came from it came from people\nHelp people and you will understand well is it is simple to tend to talk to that demographic you need to go after eventually and find out some of the things they enjoy\nAnd look at those trends you find out that you know if there were kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people find out some them what did they do what do they like where do they go do they go to movies do they not and then the judge yourself to that\n[laughter] Joyce you too smart [laughter] but but you did that doesn't that sound like like logic commonsense is not so common ... said that you know I I Do um\nI'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down and I said that's the boomers everybody you see that the boomers all sat there and I'll say okay if you are born before Nineteen eighty five sit down\nAnd ... and another large group six out of ... and I said that's Jenn ... about three people standing and they said this that's why the Gen Y or the millennials\nAre born ... or eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them I said you want to know about the new market you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here\nAnd it makes me crazy well it's it's ... you were just because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed yeah what's happening with what's happening like companies like McDonald's are they on top of things they used to be marketing geniuses something slipping\nAnd I know you're not you want to tell people I'm see McDonalds same store sales are off you know they're they're all their increases are coming from um their overseas operations [noise]\nI I I I tell folks I said listen it generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children I said and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years\nAs I said you ought to three ends of of a food it's called nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is McDonald's famous for its not nutrition [laughter] no it's it's for French fries regardless\nOf what they tried to say heart people have the impression that it's not nutritional food\n[noise] it's exactly correct and and so that's that's their problem they they like it if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food or in in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell good food you can't tell you you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts to\nWhat's going on with population trends are these shifting down to\n[noise] yeah well you know it's funny you say that uh in Nineteen ...\nWe we have a new generation is called Generation Z and Generation Z started in a two thousand five and they will they will be a but they will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully born yet\nBut in Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven we had a record year in the United states we we we have four million or three hundred and sixteen thousand babies were born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier [noise] ah\nWhat's happened since two thousand seven is is the the population has dropped like a stone we've we've gone from producing\nOver four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies a year and and so this Generation Z will be smaller you\nKnow that's a big trend Ken stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls with you next hour Iran coast to coast they get\nLearn to grow and learn to succeed and learn to thrive at Arizona State university to learn more about an see one line degrees ticks me three five five ... that's S P ac eating three five five one seven\nPastor gymnastics to Sunday mornings at eight Ninety seven boy was the big shocker more stimulating talk their retirement road map show with garments for a weekend to\nCome back in time when they talk about trends the incredible trends that the I guess can not just businesses should be using things like this I Would guess anybody who's doing something marketing niche you name it should be aware of these things should night\nYeah absolutely if that does it it it's mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't think about this because it precipitate almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\nWell it it has to a large degree um\nThe\nYou know and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that [noise] if people are still people when when you have a\nA large number of people that are consumer or a specific product at a small number of people that consume a specific product\nThe large number of people will consume more now I Know that sounds ... but the ... the smartphone has a only aged folks in their ability to consume so\nUh it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint but you have to keep in mind\nThat the thing that drives commerce of the thing that drives you know consumption is the number of people in the market period\nNow that's the that's simple isn't it\n... it almost sounds ridiculous stuff in it I mean I'm ... I mean who is out there saying well okay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then the smokers people consume smaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal\nJust based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause the the uh let me give you an example of it you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers are Twenty years ago in in vast quantities and then the the um [noise]\nUm yeah I'm a young companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of su these to a generation X as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing department said it kept on firing their\nTheir chief marketing officers because they couldn't come up with the secret to selling as many SUVs to this other group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation at\nFive and make it easy for small\nGood point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to me a couple of days ago and she said pop I you know kids are age you know what she calls herself for Cuba but she's a young woman now ah we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and you know it it's funny because I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today or the babies that are born and that's all about you know demographics\nAre born ah outside of wedlock and they're they're born outside of a of a marriage um the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture [noise] uh where Seventy five percent of the kids are bought outside of the the uh\nUh marriage ... it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that though ... whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you affect change\n[noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing\nI think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do in right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh you know you go back ... forty years\nAnd ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies with the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the\nTo a sex drugs and rock and roll what happened to the ... the the boomer hippies live became Republicans [laughter]\nIn all cases\n[laughter] no not at all cases but you know if if you if you look at [noise] that this this is ... let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise]\n[noise] ah [noise] between the ages right now of thirty four and fifty three we have a diminutive puppy a population of of indigenous people that were born here they were there were only\nAbout sixty nine million people born between sixty five an eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million born between forty five or sixty four\nWhat does that mean that means that the that particular population could not\nA support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a choice\nIs make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population are superimposed over where the heavy lift or should be with were there with you know our our strength should be in our population it's actually smaller\nSo the net result is\nA you know ... ... instead of having a you know ... ... and they should have haves and have nots with with the cushion in between of generation X we don't because\nThey were never born we're losing that cushion\nYeah well what we did and as you so you you have people saying that the the United States is is broken because we have the have nots but middle age and and I'm In\nA middle income uh our occupy exactly the same space so if you're middle ages small and then your middle income is small as well but it's a demographic issue it was just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this to be a ... let's use Facebook as an example you know they they've got to do the people on line or they've got huge amounts of advertising dollars because of what they do socially\nBut I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to do is becoming a change there were I think advertisers you begin to say I'm not sure we're getting bang for a dollar a year or you were converting these into sales because the market may not be what we really want to what's happening with that\nA Facebook is kind of strange [noise] entity if you will and I tell folks\nListen if you're if you're not paying for it you are not the customer you're the product um as far as I'm concerned and I and I've got Twenty one years experience in the marketing industry\nThe Internet are um advertising is a bottomless pit you have no idea what your pie none and there's no way to a reference any kind of success except return on investment so you you spend money on the Internet\nAnd and you just cross your fingers and hope that your sales go up your sales go up you you don't know if it's if it's a relative to how much money you spend on the Internet but uh what what's happening with a a ... a enterprise there is is not good it really isn't\nI mean it's huge but the trend here and to me the trend is very negative that it\nIs involved in what's the negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally disingenuous\nI I don't trust 'em a Facebook at all I I really don't I don't think I I think you have to understand George that everything that anybody writes on on Facebook can be analyzed and then the ... and and that analysis put people into categories and those categories\nAre are sellable and and what a sucker Berg does with that information is sell it to anybody who pay for it so there there's there's there's no security and anything that you put on Facebook nothing\nAnd well what about you know some of these wacky job so you know the idiot the shield eleven people in the Jewish synagogues ... the guy who sends out these bombs these pipe bombs they use social media to kind of spelled their hatred um how can we

presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them smoke what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\nI think that was in the punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know I I think what he has done his dignify but at the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows but\nYou know yeah uh you know on one hand you got to defend yourself on the other how much do you hire yourself in it and just move on and say you know folks I already said it I'm done with it and end it like that\nIt exactly George C ... and I respect the the um the criticism I really do of of ... my comment because when I stray outside of demography my\nOn the ... and my ability to forecast what's next based on demography is based on a ... a very macro view a very thirty thousand foot view\nWhen they you know you you asked me a question about the president I'm I made the comment about the president but that was really subjectivity on my part that I mean that's what I feel right no arguing\nYeah kind of ... what's what's going to happen going forward it is right now we have a polarized country in the country is polarized\nJust like it was in the sixties early seventies because we have a huge population of young people and a huge population of old people and in between there is a small population that does not offer\nThe the a position of of either of those too so\nUh well what I like about Dana's remarks though is she's she said how she felt without screaming without putting you down for your views and that's what it's all about that's the way it should be\nExactly yeah so so might make a comment today and it would be thank\nYou for your position if you forgot yelling at me [laughter]\nThat's true in Long Island New York to Joe go ahead\nKen two questions so it it talked about the wall Street Journal having more HIV patients that are ... and one issue than ... people have a ... you know then and how the system that's amazing explosion basically it's a lot of people pick and choose\nA their information or even at a a professional level what what's half the size of the sense that if you look at Japan people used to like\nTwenty years ago the people just work twenty four seven almost and it just hasn't worked out of individual level in Japan for people with that high octane\nA drive to a stay at the office to them at night or whatever [noise] ah so maybe they're lacking creative conscious something my second question will be it\nI have to ah stay at the office to hide or whatever [noise] ah so maybe they're lacking creative conscious something my second question would be about Amazon or\nI Know they get criticized putting out small for prior to that I can understand that but at the same time the stuff you can find on there that you can find locally even\nEven under your for example I got I got this great gloves shoveling my neighbors snow and that's the main thing I Know but I couldn't find them locally I got 'em on Amazon from like Minnesota\nI go for the first question again\n[laughter] and so I've just boiling on Long Island hey I'm from Long Island too but what was the first question\nGo ahead and give us an instance again Joe\nJoe\nYou know now that that sort of example of explosion that video ... you know like half with everything people get on a smartphone I think of as video based\nJust how should people if they're trying to move ahead or in the world just pick and choose how they consume information\nWhat to emphasize because it doesn't necessarily work out to put this grant that for that the something one that's just so so much information like you're like a carnival is sad or on the ... what good does it do the ... it's just too overwhelming\nBut where's your limits are members are quite a lot of information\nThat we get as it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know if if I'm a ... a lot of aid that the Gen Y kids the millennials are actually tuning it out you you can ask them simple questions about you know what's going on in the world and they can answer it\nBut ... how do you sift through this what you have to do is you have to compare several sources that's and that's what I Do when I Do research and when I Do presentations I really\nDon't I come to any kind of conclusions unless I've compared a variety of sources and that's what helps me with information [noise] in in terms of Amazon\nI think Amazon is just you know ... what we did when we open the Internet we opened up the world we we just that was our view to the innards of the world and I think what's what's going down with Amazon is just something that's naturally transpiring and I think it's just going to get nothing but bigger\nYou're going to see commerce is going to change everything about commerce is going to change\nWe've got a company that shift radios they make radios and they make darn good radio see Korean company and I I used to get my radio from them long before I started doing this show\nAnd it was simple you you go on line you order what you want it's delivered to your house in some cases it's free shipping based on the deal that they've got at any given time\nI mean you don't have to park your car you don't have to spend money on gasoline you don't have to find a crowd it's a ... it's amazing\nIt's amazing I mean\nIt's infinitely easier you know when you look at the boomers what how do you do business with a boomer you save them some time you make their life easy and you don't rip them off this was perfect and so Amazon is is it's going to do nothing but a grow\nA you know and that online retail ... will exceed you know the temperature that word is now is probably going to twenty percent thirty percent\nI think so too they hurt bricks and mortar but I mean the the the goods are still being manufactured um the Amazon employees zillion people um some of which complained about their job they're um or conditions and things like that but I mean there are retired people so\nThere's displacement so when the bricks and mortar stores go really the only big thing to get hurt and you know some people are out of work that they can find jobs elsewhere\nIt's the real estate that just sits there what's gonna happen with that stuff\n[noise] that's a good question you know I Know that a a commercial real estate is you know as you know suffering some issues right now some serious issue\nI mean if you were an investor would you buy a mall right about now\nNo no no but but but I certainly would buy residential you would\nI Would buy residential every day of the week yeah it's a seller rent up\nYes [laughter] yeah no in fact I'm you know I I have a house in um but either Springs Florida and I and I have a house in in ... Connecticut and a\nHalf and half of Connecticut's four thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just rattle around in it and what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it we're going to come up with an executive rental for it [noise] and and that's going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people will come into all areas that don't want ... got to be very big\nWell you've got the company like air being beat up the rent townhouse houses and I mean yeah I Know people who own houses and they solicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that\nVery happy very cool yeah and I I Would I Would subscribe to that\nIt ... you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes [noise]\nOne of the things that that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and if that's going to remain in place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force\nThat essentially demanded a you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force that we've ever had\nIs a very young right now and just entering the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them can\nOh yeah cagey C direct dot com K.

talked\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast we're with skin going back as we talk about trends what about India can they do in the same thing as China are they in a different position\nThey aren't there aren't really in an entirely different position and and but they have their own problem there about one point four billion people in fact we're not really even sure how many people are in India but we we ah my best guess is that there's more people in India that there are in China\nBut they have about a two and a half trillion dollar GDP and then what and you know may sound like a lot but when you compare that to the United states with twenty trillion GDP there's really no comparison so it it's it's not India is not an up and comer the biggest problem that India has is wealth distribution\nThey literally have haves\nAnd have nots here and there is no\nOne in between and uh they they don't seem to be able to get a handle on that\nWhen when you have the haves and have nots aren't you creating civil unrest and everything else\nYeah you would think that but they kind of a passive people but I you know I I don't know you you would you would think that there would be kind of an unrest ah because they're poor people are really poor and the rich people really rich\nNext dumped on when it between let's go to Josh in Toronto, Canada hey Josh thanks for calling\nGo ahead good evening gentlemen I'm doing great thank you good I'm a longtime listener love your show George here every night even from are out there\nThank you Josh thanks for hanging in there with us so long\nAnyway I just want to touch on that Amazon thing I don't know if your guest hurt can I don't know if you hurt a Amazon is opening now Amazon Go stores and they're planning to open up a many many more three thousand in total by the end of the twenty Twenty one have you heard about that\nI Can't I have not and the water goes towards a Josh\nAnd so basically you go in and you pick up a I guess the most popular items and you just buy it right there retail wise instead of on line so at a retail store Amazon Go\nWalk you get the items that they have there and the most popular items I guess that that month or that week or whatever and you just pick it up and go get phone charger things of that nature uh\nInteresting then I bet they would use their website to let you know what products are going to happen in the store at any given time\nI'm sure and that that's a great thing for me or of the older generation or don't really feel comfortable with computers they can just walk and it got what they want and go Amazon Go\nInteresting take on Sundays that earlier Amazon Go son Sam's on go I've got to go somewhere mind with Halloween coming up Kim yeah well\nThe thing that the concern that I Would have about that is the same concern that I had with Amazon taking over whole foods and that is a when you have a brick and mortar store retailers details of very very different a kind of business at Amazon has succeeded in so I don't know let's let's see what they do with this\nThat could be intriguing\nYeah could be I can get up whenever ... sometimes ... ... people that are successful get caught up in your own success and think they can do\nEverything everything that it's right\nHere and so the the whole whole foods thing is sort of successful but I don't know I really don't know if they're going to make it with that\nLet's go to ... go ahead sir\nGeorge I'm a longtime listener too and you are the best ... teams to truck driver master free thank you your age I'm the one you know I'm a Gemini in Nineteen fifty I think\nYou're saying the same thing June June for for me huh June for for me to learn about you\nYeah yeah I'm a thirty first okay for a boy you're older than me any way you of your mind and the great man and\nYou're very family and you know it was going to exercise the your guest about um you know the abortion issue we're losing a lever because of abortions but at the top of our heard\nA kind of a liberal and it was kinda hurtful where they talked about nationalism being with white Christians\nAnd then at the bottom of the hour I heard about the global elite planning and then when I thought about that and I remember going back to most of the abortions back then whoa whoa white people when you have\nIs Seventy eight eighty million people now I don't know what the abortion number is 'cause I just knew that I had a lot of friends with my customers driving the truck I used to hear about a whip lady's gonna adopt baby so that he wanted to have an abortion\nAnd the truck I used to hear about\nA whip lady's gonna adopt baby so that he wanted to have an abortion blah blah blah and and it was just the big problem back in the late eighties but them to shut the story of because ... and\nI'm just wondering um you know the the control with the elite with the abortion and uh and how much we lost the um\nThe work ethic because of abortion\nSo her and the little the chicken or how many people I don't know what the county has but what do you think that readers can\nAbout a million a year for a million ... million\nAbout a million a year and and that it's it's a disproportionate a at a at ethnically so [noise] ah we we have aborted about forty million people\nUh you know in in the last forty years we just out in ... and it's that um it it's a it's a terrible thing I don't think we would have forty million more people if if abortion was illegal\nOr simply because I think people use abortion his birth control I I don't think they use it as a I mean it's it's it's almost like a [noise] you know a a pill\nAnd ... yeah well people the people that are going to have\nFour kids are going to have four kids and and if it if you know you have an unwanted pregnancy at a particular time and ah they seem to have their abortions\nMary in Portland hey Mary taken away\nOr anger night by Utah oh my yeah that was\n... can thing of Pam pan and the end of it now have a cat and all that where in fact going\nWell is there are three under served um like categories in relative to health care right now one of them is health care the others elder care in the last one is death care\nDeath care is totally under sort of we don't have enough funeral homes they don't have enough cemeteries we don't have enough ... to handle what's going to happen when the boomers start to die\nElder care is totally under served healthcare people's need healthcare but there there's there's a trigger year and it's it's Seventy five and the baby boomers right now at fifty four to Seventy three so two years from now you're going to see a spike\nIn health care or the need for health care services like we've never seen before in the history of our nation\nCan I remember when you were on with me a year ago we talked about the like marketing Harley Davidson they missed the boat too didn't they\nYeah Harley Davidson right now the the ... if you if you if your listeners have a Harley don't try to sell it because you're not going to get anything for a it is because the baby boomers have literally moved on the baby boomers are are fifty four Seventy three years old and a lot of them can't hold hardly up at a light anymore\nEither that'd be bikes\nThat generation right behind him is too small to sustain it it it it just is the people that were born in\nThe Nineteen eighty four is a small or indigenous generation of about this uh sixty nine million\nPeas the markets motorcycles going down\nYeah it is that's interesting overall

that's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing like\nA right to see 'em there's always this seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it I I\nI Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so in ... and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a\nA small plane or buy a ferry or vote or there was no bridge to that island so there's

mean to you know you're you're you're in academia um yeah we were just science in it\n[noise] well I I've been doing\nA lot of reading in a in you know I'm not a scientist but I did I've done a lot of reading and quantum physics and\nAnd I talk a lot to uh I I have communication with folks that have passed on and and that happened randomly before but now I figured out a way to make it more regular but\nSo I've asked the awful lot of questions and I've done a lot of reading and I've met people like dean rating who are just you know wonderful and very easy to talk to and explained difficult things and from what I understand what I Believe is that the the paranormal the paranormal world is actually the quantum world so by studying quantum mechanics\nAnd how that works I think I have a good idea of how the paranormal world works and I've come up with a model\nA ... ... how I I fit in what what I understand to be\nGoing on and tell them it's almost with that model might be\nWell the idea is that uh that I okay I'll I'll I'll look at it this way so I ... in the morning I take these I I call them a a meditative walks so so when I'm walking my one way of looking\nMe and said I'm I'm a a a a a particle being I Am a bean physical being but if you see that I'm I'm\nOne way of looking at me and said I'm I'm a a a a a particle being I Am a bean physical being\nBut if you see that I'm I'm moving and if you look at like in in in fast motion or whatever I Would be like a blur so I'm really I'm a I'm a wave more than I Am a a a a particle being and I and my my location\nIs is not just in one place so I kind of see that in the in the quantum world that's that's what it is everything is in wave form and we don't see the world that way because you know that some in the subatomic world but if you take it up to the macroscopic world than you think about that ah that\nI I'm not in any one location and it and that and and that's kinda how how I see it and and I think that that helps me understand how\nThis works and the the other thing is these near death experiences that I've had a like for instance I think we have many forks and what I call forks and the road of time I talk about that in the book\nWhere we experience a maybe a near death experience or a close call and I've had a couple of those and in one dimension I think is where it comes into you know a different dimensions\nI think that we we might die in that particular thing that that incident and another's we we live on is if that didn't happen\nUh and and sometimes we have knowledge of what the incident might have been or maybe sometimes we don't and uh and then we can have many of these forks in the road of time throughout our our our lives and keep going from one life to the next ... but at the same time that we're doing that there's this\nSpiritual part of us so there's actually two partners the physical form and then there's the spiritual form or that that is eternal and that's where I come up with the uh the title of the book which is timeless that that we don't really\nEver die\nAnd intellectual is you have documented thirty four ... cases that happened to you have there been more you just didn't put them all in the book\nYeah ah [laughter] there there's a lot more and I have I've already written the second book he'll come out next year I call it timeless deja vu and uh I have twenty eight more experiences and I I I I kind of wanted to test the waters with the first book\nOkay I have I saved some of the more well I'll just say a little bit more bizarre stuff for the second book based on the reaction of the first\nOne well sounds like we're going to have your back about the same time next year huh\nAnd I and I yeah I plan to release it about you know the late summer early fall and and then I I also have a third book plan too so I I there's a lot of the incidents the they keep happening\nI I was going to ask you how does your boot because and we'll save a lot of it for the next book but you had mentioned the experiences where you know you may have died in one life but not in another do you think that\nSometimes we might have memory of other existence is in other pure allele universes and that's why we have deja vu\nI I I Believe so in fact uh I I remember as a as a kid and this is interesting because I think\nChildren are very open to the spirit world or the paranormal world but third ... that's kind of over the years it's kind of a through our education system or sometimes maybe by their parents are different\nOrganizations it's kind of a you know drained out of them but I remember as a kid thinking I Wonder if I've already died and I'm somebody else now I think I Am\nAnd it's and and I don't necessarily remember a previous life experience from that but I I remember thinking that a lot I mean a lot and uh so I I I think that's interesting that that children have those those are\nYou know those kinds of feelings but I'll give you an incident that happened just recently with me and my son we were driving here in Southern California on a sub surface streets and I I look down just momentarily I don't know what it was something that dropped onto the floor monument or whatever and I looked up and when I looked up and I thought it was just a split second here I was\nHurdling through a red light oh it was terrible\nAnd and how will the sun\nOr he's he's Eighteen okay he's sitting in the in the passenger seat and freaky no yeah he\nHe is and we're going through the intersection and on either side of is is a car you know two cars coming right at us so\nWhat was going to happen that I can see was that we're going to get T bone from both sides and just you know ... a pinch between the two uh and uh at that moment everything slowed down ... everything's slowed down and it was if I had all the time in the world to figure out how I was going to\nManeuver your way around a\nYeah and the next thing I Know I I I maneuver through and next thing I Know we're on the other side there was honking going on and the cars when everybody was safe and a time got back to normal speed again\nAnd I I think that I think what what happens is that we had we had glimpse the quantum world at that point and then the quantum world and in the paranormal world as my spirit friends have told me there there is no past there is no future it's all just an eternal now\nAnd and\nThat that's what I felt like and I and then I thought this is probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time because then another dimension which we might have had this horrible accident\nKnows it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour\nOh at each other like that or\nYou know that there could have been people killed and it's at least seriously injured and uh and we were unscathed and so were the other two cars thank God but um so it so I I I ...\nThat is what I'm Talking about and I've had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh experience where I\nI uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm\nUp at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception passing the north end to with the island there is a a to bridge spans that go from the mainland to\nWhip the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass island and we always used to stop there when when we went camping and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that\nThat that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak on for the\nYeah the ... ... and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff\nAnd then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air it was like everything stopped and once again I felt this\nThis light in this warmth and the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling somebody's watching Uber's there's a

situations have you've stumbled into that\nYes unfortunately the boy\nThat is that is also out there in the paranormal world and the spirit world than ...\nThings as far as I understand have never been human never will be human but they are very real and very scary out a couple of them I'm One of 'em was a ah when I was about Eighteen years old I was in a very low place in my life very uh down\nI was a not very successful I dropped out of school a out of the University of Washington I was living at my brother's garage sleeping on the concrete floor in a mattress and a\n... just the night before this incident happened I I had cut across\nYou know I I was Eighteen but I was still acting like I was a little kid I'd still cut across yards and jump fences and stuff 'cause just to you know 'cause I it it just an old habit yeah anyway I went through the yard of of an old lady\nWho all of us in the in the neighborhood thought she was a witch and uh she lived alone and there was a story I don't know if it was true that her husband had died and she left him there for a month and told the neighbors complain that you know there was something some kind of odd smell and then uh any wait 'til she her legend grew by leaps and bounds\nSo I was ... I was cutting through her yard and I saw a candle light in the window and I just momentarily look in there she was and she was very scary looking person she had you know this gray hair that was kind of shooting off and all direction\nYeah you had this she had the old ... syndrome right\nYes she had the ... camp as it turned out cancerous or on her nose and\nShe had me I felt like a deer in headlights I was just frozen and I was just staring at her and she had it was either it was a candle yeah she had a candle in the window and she was just staring at me and it it just scared me and finally I broke away from her gays and I ran to my brother's garage and I and I and I you know went into I\nAsleep well later that probably early in the morning I woke up to a very frightening site or at the foot of my the mattress bad that I was sleeping on the floor there was like a a column of fire that was coming up out of the floor\nAnd I I thought this is the worst during this is a horrible dream and so I pinch myself I slap myself and no I was awake in this column fire then spread over me in an arc\nFrom head from foot over my head you know probably six feet in the air and kind of like an art and like pulsating fire like a current a fire going over my head\nAnd it and if that wasn't scary enough there was also this this very dim what I Would classify as the demonic low gravelly voice speaking in in ... just these guttural tones\nAnd I'm not sure how long it lasted it might have just been a couple of minutes but it seemed like it it took forever\nAnd ah it was very very frightening and it was it was horrible and and I after it was over\nI was you know my heart rate was way up I was sweating I immediately called my my girlfriend and and uh I told her you know there's something terrible happened she said well you know why don't you come over in in in the morning and I did and I explained it to her and she looked at me and she said uh\nWell you know uh I think maybe we should call a psychiatrist what do you think and I said well\nJust forget it you know maybe I just made it up but of course I didn't write it happened and I I think it had something to do with this this old lady I think that I had frightened or or made her angry\nAnd something had been some and and I it was a terrible terrible thing and that that that's one of the experiences I've had it's one of the most scary things that's a that's ever happened to me and just as as I remember it as if it would just happened yesterday I could feel the heat I could hear that gravelly voice that just seemed to fill the whole room and\nYeah it was it was it was horrible\nWouldn't want to go through that again would you\nKnow no it was it was it was very real very reel to reel and nothing that it it's like I think what happens is that these kinds of things you know when you're at the lowest point in your life and that's when you're susceptible a and I I think that that that they seize that opportunity\nI think so too I mean they they\nAnd that's when you're susceptible a and I I think that they seize that opportunity\nI think so too I mean they they know when you're down they know when you're on drugs or you're drunk yeah and that's when they get you and it gets you a good time I don't want to dwell too much on the ... but tell us the other story\nWell the other one ah also of a foolish kind of thing or are there was actually a a I was in Germany I was a soldier in Germany at working at the prison the military prison and Mannheim West Germany when it was east and West Germany West Germany\nAnd uh there was a a a counselor at the prison of all people of counsellors like a senior and CEO and he\nWas into a a a witchcraft so he had invited me and my girlfriend to his his room to it 'cause he was bragging about what are you know powerful word locker which or whatever that he wasn't\nAt the time I was kind of I'm kind of interest that kind of skeptical been interested\nSo we went in there it into his room and he had this very frightening set up you know very typical Satan worshipping kind of stuff upside down across uh a goats had kind of thing going on and candles and\n... and that stuff so I said well I you know I don't think this has anything that I'm interested in and I got my girlfriend and we left and\nAnd he was being very very spooky and very scary about this whole thing and\nAnd uh so I decided that I was going to look into a a you know this kind of thing so I I\nI thought maybe as a defense you know I maybe I should try to one of them you know and try to scare him or something and and uh and I also felt like maybe he was trying to move in on my girlfriend too so I had a little bit of that you know kind of thing going on competitive thing\nSo I I went to the uh you know for soldiers they had a art rooms or like arts and crafts areas and and uh there was a a um [noise] uh ceramics instructor there and he's I asked I'd like to you know do something with some clay and he said gave me some clay and\nI had been looking at a demon knowledge the book and or or no no he had a demon algae but that's what it was and I was fashioning a a what I thought would be you know some kind of scary looking head and it turned out to be a demon had\nNor did I in fashion and this was just you know very stupid to be doing this and as I was doing this this guy took notice of made this instructor and he had the steam analogy book and uh\nHe said you know I'm very interested in this what is this year doing I said well I'm just trying to make this scary looking ahead to scare the sky and he said well that's\nThat's very very interesting you know I'm very interested in in the mineralogy and he started to get really strange you know just like the counselor at the prison he was acting very strange like they were maybe birds of a feather or something\nAnd uh so I finished this demon head and I got out of there\nAnd I took it back to the barracks and I took it to my girlfriend's room and she wasn't there at the time but her ... her girlfriend a roommate let me in and I set it up on her night stand and there was like this mirror behind it and I said okay I'm going to freak her out and then I'm going to freak her out and then we're going to go and freak out this other guy and get him to get you know get away from us\nSo I set up these candles surrounded stupid right\nSo uh I was the intent was the intent was good right\nIt it was it was maybe a good intent but it was playing with stuff I didn't understand so I'm sitting there looking at it and the girlfriend left I mean the the uh the roommate left and I was just there by myself sitting there staring at the ... all of a sudden it's lips started to move\nAnd it started to say things in that same kind of guttural voice that I had heard uh before I joined the army\nAnd that that other incident that I told you about and uh it was it was it was pretty scary and I thought at first this isn't real but then they kept happening and then my girlfriend walked in and she immediately said what are you doing and I said well your roommate Libyan and then she says what does that\nAnd she pointed to and I said oh that's the thing I made to scare you know this councilor guy and she said you\nKnow that's very interesting because when I was in and she was telling me when I was in high school I made something that looked exactly like that and I have to throw it away because it started to interact with me and I and I said well that hey that's what this did you know and she\nShe freaked out she grabbed it she opened up the window and from the third floor she threw it out the window into the dumpster that was down on the in the parking lot and she said you don't ever play around with that kind of stuff and\nUh so that was the other kind of demonic a incident that I that I had so that the the big lesson there's don't play around with things you don't understand even if the intention might be somewhat good\nSeconds I'm traveling at fifty five miles an hour walk enough time to challenge Lincoln of football fields making decisions don't take singer and\nThen they

nutrition\nLike there was an earthquake but there was nothing else in the room that was moving it was just the stuff on the night stand there was my wife's ah my wife at the time\nOr her hand mirror or a clock\nAnd a few other little items that were on the night standard vibrating and some of them fell off\nAnd I put them back on there and and and then it it kept vibrating again and then I just happened to look out the window and there was like a Greenbelt behind our apartment behind discussed house the spar and there was a Green Belt and then there was another uh apartment building maybe four stories high much bigger a complex\nAnd I I look directly into this window and there was a man standing there it looked like a man and he was very dark and he was a in kind of in the shadows but I could see there was a figure of a man and he was pointing at me\nAnd and I went out with the voting singer I Hope no not a voting thing will just\nIt just seemed like a guy but he was moving in a very strange way so I looked at him as soon as I think he recognized I looked at him the vibration stopped\nSo I I don't know what he was doing or what what reason he would have for doing it or what you know obviously you had some kind of tell the kinetic powers because it was related to what was going on because as soon as he moved away from that window and there was he wasn't there the the the items stopped and I\nYou know you know and I didn't have that feeling that somebody pulling me off to bed so it was that was pretty frightening because I didn't know what he was up to whatever it was was not good I can guarantee that\nI'm going to hinge Bruce that when you went through that red light and you made it through all lives loser reason you still here have you figured out what the reason is yeah\nYeah and uh it's it's related to what this vision I had two years ago my friend gene who came to me and told me it was time it was time to tell these stories\nTo not be afraid to tell the stories people will come it's kind of like the old you know field of dreams build it and they will come a and that's exactly what what has been happening everything that he said\nUh is that I I I think I Do have a mission I I I I Know that you know I I think the fact that I\nHave all these credentials and stuff maybe that helps people accepted more but it it it's unfortunate that it should be that way but I think it does kind of a you know give people the idea that uh you know maybe he's he's more credible but\nI you know I don't know but uh I I Do know that I Do have this mission to get these stories out and to help people understand and to support people like a scientist like dean rating and others in trying to figure this out you know and and are\nYou know very chronically under funded because there's you know there it's difficult for them to get funding\nAnd I think this is it's probably one of the most important things that we can we can do in our lives as is try to figure out how this the spiritual world works and it and it gives great comfort to people when I I I although I don't I'm not a practicing medium\nHow this the spiritual world works and it and it gives great comfort to people when I although I don't I'm not a practicing medium I Do I I Am able to to to do it\nAnd I I share this with my friends and family members and and uh people who um you know who asked me I don't do it for money or anything just do it because I feel it's a service to my fellow a human beings and it provides\nThem with comfort and and it doesn't work every time you know a ... and I know there Charlotte ... out there and and young and there are some real people they do for a\nLiving and I don't I don't ah you know the grudge them to make a living of it you know fair living as long as they're providing a a a decent service for people but uh it it is it is real it's very real\nAnd uh they've tried to that is one of the more difficult things for scientists to research although they've noticed that when people say they're having a spiritual connection that later proves to be you know\nYou know they got some things right about this person's a loved one\nA there is certain parts of the brain that they can pick up I guess some kind of imaging I don't know if they use an MRI or what they do but uh so there is there is something that doesn't prove necessarily but it does show that there is something going on uh in in there is a a a connection being made\n'em and uh so I I ... that that is the mission that I'm On the mission I mine is too is to convey what I've found out and what I asked my friend Jean and\nAnd ah there's another lady that passed on three years ago she was a colleague of mine and a good friend and I also have some contact with her and I've asked them a lot of questions when I go on this walking meditation that I Do quite often\nAnd uh and connect with them and and\nThe things that I've learned are are are are pretty amazing and I I Want to share them with people and I and I I feel I I that I have to do it it I Want to do it but I feel like I have to do it too it's kind of like all the books I've written all the plays that I've written\nI felt compelled to do it it wasn't just something I sat down okay I'm going to write a play or I'm going to write a book it's always I feel compelled to do it I have to do it and I'm more than happy to to you know to to do this and and help people and I think I I have helped some people\nLet's go to the phones for you if they have a story I'll have you evaluated forest and Bruce of it's just a question then take it away Thomas a lawyer California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call and Bruce wild I miss my question Bruce I'm you spoke about your near accident in the intersection\nAnd job comment and question the comment is angels appear to be non denominational they appear\nChristianity and Islam Hindu was some voters some tower some\nAnd and all of the indigenous traditions around the world whether they're called angels are being supplied whatever my question to you set you metaphorically dodged a bullet in that\nIntersection\nHow can the average man they average woman develop cultivate a few well close personal relationship\nWith their guardian angels day by day even hour by hour something bad is tangible with absolute certainty\nWell that's that's a that's a very good\nQuestion and I I Will uh started off by saying that that everybody has these abilities are often the light lie dormant sure because of you know ... when we were children we probably had you know pretty equal abilities and there's some people that have a little bit more than others but then\nThrough the experiences that people have the the accepted more and more and they're closer to the the spirit world so I'd say doing whatever you can to get a closer to that spirit world some people do it through meditation\nI just let it randomly happen because the door seem to be open since age for so it never quite shut so\nThings kept happening but now I've I've learned to through meditation or what I call walking meditation all explaining I'm I Can't sit still very very long so I I have trouble doing the lotus position you know kind of traditional meditation so I I go on a walk\nUh that's when I can get into the I guess what scientists would call an alpha brainwave state and at that point is when I can I I'll say a prayer\nA and I I I Do believe in God and I say prayers even when I'm not meditating but any way I Will I Will ask my guardian angel or some people practicing a professional uh mediums will say these are your spirit guides you know um and I will ask them to help me\nTo connect to those that are that are passed on and to receive whatever messages they have\nAnd uh and and to help people if they have messages they want me to pass on to their loved ones which is usually what it is and I I Would say just having a practice of that I Do it almost every day my foot has hurt right now so I haven't been able to do it so I feel kind of stifles but the last couple of days but uh\nMaking a practice of that type of mindful meditation and what my spirit friends tell me that in what they told me to tell my students in the class is to have what they call focused calm\nTo be focused but be very calm\nAnd as you're doing this meditation and it will it will happen it might happen slowly it might not be you know like a an immediate you know like an epiphany or are very profound at first it might just come slowly might even think it's your imagination but it's not it'll it'll keep building day by day\nAnd before you know it you you have you're more in touch with these things and you can also when you when the door opens you'll ... you'll go back in time and see oh my gosh I've had these experiences before and maybe I didn't I didn't recognize it so it it goes like backwards in\nTime as well once that door has opened Bruce ... go ahead yeah no that's the best way I can I can explain it I think it's a it's a life lifetime journey and and everybody's at\nTheir own pace you know like I tell my students you know some people say you know I'm like thirty five years old and these kids are like Twenty years old and I'm way behind you know I've been you know taking care of kids and working and now I'm going

book Bruce\nWell uh you can get it on Amazon and uh I think it was on Barnes and noble and maybe some other places but I think the primary places Amazon there seems to be pretty good price on Amazon right now so\nWell that's a great way now let's talk about the story of\nHell\nYou've done is a chapter about he'll he'll is empty colon\nHell is empty well that is the uh that's actually one of the uh the the demon stories are okay okay yeah I used the quote from a Shakespeare\nThat uh uh the hell is empty all the demons or hear all the devils are here you know that so I yeah I use that and I but it and speaking about health I think that's a that's a good topic\nAh that's one of the questions that I ask a my spirit friends uh I said well what happens to the bad people are they they're in the spirit world with you and and ah they the the answer that I got a was kind of interesting it was well there there are\nThese demonic elements in in the spirit world but they're not necessarily in the same ZIP Code\nI get on his way to describe it uh and I think that what what I understand is that people who have done very very bad things you know on this earth and the physical form a are probably hanging out with those folks and that in that area of the spirit world\nBut they do get a chance to come back and try to make it right and I think that can take a very very long time many probably many incarnations for them to\nTry to to get things right and uh I I think that goes along with with you know a lot of eastern religions to talking about bad karma and that kind of stuff [noise] uh so that's that's my impression of what a what helped me maybe\nLet's go to rural in England or in California your neck of the words Bruce go ahead and rolling\nOh my goodness hello ms

able to do and I will take my question off the air\nThank you roll and I I Know what you're going to see Bruce ... go ahead\nYeah well I think I think everybody has this that the the capability to do it or do you have the inclination or are you willing to take a chance are you willing to also protect yourself in in the process to realize that there are\nA you know faults paths here and there and uh so I I I think it is it is possible for anybody like the the last caller\nOr you know the same type of advice that we can we can cultivate these things and and do so very cautiously and carefully and and slowly and ah and it is something that and I think that the last caller to ah Thomas a had a good point he said all that it unites this idea of angels unites the whole world\nAnd I would I Would go farther and say the paranormal unites all cultures all around the world it's a connection point that we are\nThis idea of angels unites the whole world\nAnd I would I Would go farther and see the paranormal unites all cultures all around the world it's a connection point that we all have and I think as we learn more and scientists help us more I think that's going to connect us more and and then perhaps bring bring better times for us because we certainly need the help\nWell we sure do don't we Renee is with us in San Francisco first time caller Hi Renee\nHi guy a I'm a Bruce I'm the

BP's well uh yeah so um electronic voice phenomena um I I\nI think that they can be very helpfully because the it folks in the spirit world that are residing there we'll we'll try just about any way to get a hold of us especially their loved ones uh I hear all I've heard all kinds of stories you know that sometimes they'll uh\nItems will be misplaced for a while and then all of a sudden show up in a very unique location to you know to give you a sign that that they're there and that they want to connect with you\nAnd I think the voice phenomena could also be a a you know something like that that they're that they're trying to reach out and and and that is what I encountered when I Do this walking meditation is\nThat they desperately they desperately want to connect with their loved ones and pass on messages and sometimes it's very sometimes it's kind of sad sometimes it's a you know regrets too which is a very sad thing\nBut are often times it's just messages of love and and you know they're they're okay not to worry about them anymore\nAnd when do you mean by could be said\nWell I had this one experience where I connected with a lady had asked me if I could connect with her father\nDid a and I got some of the things you know you don't get everything right 'cause there's interference you know like with anything else yeah uh and uh I got some of the things right and then he told me and I I sensed in him and sadness and kind of some like he had regrets and I said\nA sense that is that something you'd like to share\nWith me why you feel that way and he he said well no and I don't want you to tell her that I have this these feelings either\nIt was it was very hard for me because this lady was very much wanted to connect with their fathers are on it\nTo tell her but I I couldn't tell her and I am not going to see the names or whatever but uh so\n... and sometimes it's not always you know rainbows and lollipops you know\nWas was it emotional for you\nIt was it was very emotional I was sometimes they you know their messages make me you sometimes tears of joy sometimes in this case kind of I felt this man's sadness\nAnd I think one of the winery reasons they all wanted to heal really win was to make sure we never knew any of what we know do no\nRush Ninety seven point one big talker\nBack in the morning and more stimulating talk from the Ninety seven point one big talker studios in always online ad big talk radio dot com which is Kevin Williams in Sedona overnight partly cloudy below forty eight Suzie brings a combination of clouds assumption typical cool today\nShoveling ... forty seven overnight partly cloudy sunny clouds Tuesday to hide sixty eight and ... below thirty nine out to a club the sunshine Tuesday sections of the shower ISIS these\nSeven point one of the big sucker is gay Katrina village flex Prescott Ninety seven\nThe sunshine Tuesday such acts of the shower I used\nTo study seven point one of the big duck or his KBC K Katrina village Flagstaff press getting Ninety seven point one the big talk to her more stimulating Todd\n[noise]\nTrump will have the Pittsburgh today I'm Dave Anthony Fox News\nSo my respects I'm also going to the hospital to see the officers and uh some of the people that were so badly hurt\nOn the president told Fox the shooting spree at a synagogue Saturday was disgraceful though some in Pittsburgh a Jewish community don't want him to calm morning the president to further condemn white nationalist the White House says he has the accused gunman Robert Bowers was in court yesterday\nWe will have the opportunity to present evidence demonstrating that Robert Bauer was murdered eleven people or exercising their religious beliefs and then he shot or injured ... others\nU.S attorneys Scott Brady Bowers could ultimately face the death penalty also in court yesterday and also ordered job without Bob Caesar say are a man accused of mailing pipe bomb was a prominent Democrats are Fifteen suspicious packages intercepted yesterday sent the CNN in Atlanta\nThe u._s. was sending some five thousand troops to help border patrol is thousands of Central American migrants make their way to the U.S the president told Fox is Laura Ingraham\nThis caravan there's not they wasting their time they are not coming in the military going to be a little ... both sat in the national guard later that no effect\nThen I mean this is the ...

might do it more effectively rather than stopping them here stuff that I saw\nWere out there are a lot of people who would agree with you I'm guessing and people who say it's not our problem is not up

of these things and these people contribute to it so is there I mean it's just it's a headache and have a rich\nEverybody contributes to all of it but they also complicated piece of this is that we're all connected to each other now um because borders which uh you know poor is an author Fishell really\nUm exist so we we can say what they didn't top problem but ...\nAnd tragically and ah 'cause many people and knowingly it is so that we want to send\nThat we want this and five thousand two hundred troops that it in the minute train troops who would back at base or doing something like fighting
