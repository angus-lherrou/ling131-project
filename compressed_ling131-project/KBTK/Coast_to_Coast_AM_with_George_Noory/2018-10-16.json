following week from people who said oh my God\nMy watch is working it hasn't worked in years the funny part about all this is ... years later we re ran part of that program on our weekend shows\nAnd I started getting emails from people\nAfter that Shane George my watches are working my clock is working and I'm going what's going on here or he was on two years ago and it didn't dawn on me that we

region formation and had him on my local show when I was the night talking\nWe've stayed friends ever since lots of things have been going on in your life and we'll get into that ... while you're with us but the big story that has started to come out has been the CIA recruiting\nYou a long long time ago what did they want with you\n[noise] okay where it all started um when I was Thirteen Years old I Lived in Cyprus and you could see how we left because my parents divorced my mother remarried Hungarian Jew living in the ... which is the capital of the Cyprus yes and he added\nTiny bed and breakfast type of a hotel with a Thirteen rooms and most signed the Israeli intelligence services they found out that we're from Israel\nSo they basically turned the hotel into ... and into a more safe house so spies would come into the hotel they would check on their you know teachers geology ... but they were really most of the agents that were\nFrom Cyprus where a flying out to Syria and Jordan and Egypt and Iraq to spy\nAnd there were problems in Cyprus if I remember during that time period because I always used to remember them talking about ... fighting with Greek people and there was something going on there wasn't there\nOh yeah there was a civil war it was it was just awful yeah but I was when I when I came to Cyprus I was only eleven I didn't know English and I so people blown up I I I mean ... out of Mormons\nI've seen everything ah curfews bombs exploding ah so being at that age it really changes your life\nSo I went through the whole war the Greeks were killing ... the British soldiers the Turks were killing the Greeks but why all this was going on I was ah I befriended their most how the agent who told me to you know run errands for him he would send me letters\nWe she didn't allow me to open but my task was to jump on the bicycling psycho them to the conflict in the Israeli conflict anyhow their reason I told you the story is because I already was excited\nAbout you know the the the life for fear of spy young and I love movies so to make a long story short um when I became kind of well known in Israel I met Tom go their Meyer who is a\nPrime minister right\nAnd she introduced me to Ari Sharon you know these are all of your gender roles and that they aren't sure and introduced me to the intelligence community and they started using my abilities\nHold on right there or we're going to take a break in let's come back and pick that up right from there because\nYou truly route in the middle of all that with some of the leaders of Israel

shut all who ended up being the prime minister and then went into a coma and less for longer than I ever thought he would but they they they recruited you basically didn't they\nYes they introduced me to the head of Mossad\nUh they recruited me and I started doing some work for them which we weren't going to but they basically didn't have the technology\nTo test my abilities and they picked up the

... the occurs\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy two I left is where it straight to California to Palo Alto to Stanford research Institute which is today Stanford University and I went through rigorous a laboratory controlled condition test\nA and then I started working for the CIA doing you know stuff all over the place for them but just about a year ago I asked you mentioned before the CIA release

golden rule is protection\nAgainst evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we are apt to overlook familiar things we are apt to overlook simple things\nIf you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there was an esoteric and a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nIs my contention in the book and I felt they really have to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of science has from cyclical research the quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nThat time is not what we think it is linear time is basically a very powerful illusion that we use to organize our lives and it's a necessary illusion but if it's an illusion that means that we are selecting\nEvents all the time from across in and finish to the possibilities so I don't use the term manifest I use the term select and you can select events under the right circumstances within exquisitely focused and the motive Lee charged\nThought and that's what's going on we are selecting and the same way that when you take a measurement in particle lab you're very decision to take that measurement will affect what you experience the same is true in our life\nCan you use these powers to affect your health\nWithout question and and I have to emphasize that we live under lots of laws and forces\nOr one of them is a lot of physical declined one of them is a lot more talented there's never been an exception to that but one must never feel that you're without devices that you're without tools in the book I write about extraordinary\nCases of spontaneous remission of diseases which doesn't mean that is going to happen to people all the time I Would never extend false hope but the cases are there the occurrences are there and we have to probe and look at these things very often they correlate with intensive\nA meditation people who have meditative three hours a day have recorded instances in the medical literature of remission of diseases not all the time but it has occurred\nYou say that when you were writing the book or something weird happened with the rock band the monkeys\nOh it was the one hand on George talk about us all being loose in time a couple of summers ago I was getting into the music of the\nMonkeys just completely out of the blue and my wife thought I was going nuts my kids were memorizing there I Would\nThink you are going nuts yes you would think that no one can imagine what they have they didn't have a few good songs\nReally did they had some beautiful pop song [laughter] [laughter] and I was playing them all the time I was getting into them everybody thought I was going crazy I couldn't figure out why\nIt was months and months later that I got a call from an editor at the Washington Post who said to me do you know Mike Nesmith who was one of the members of the monkeys I said no\nHe said that you know Nesmith just wrote a memoir and I said no\nAnd he said did you know he was a Christian Scientists which is a a a a healing and and mentally based on a form of spirituality\nI said no he said well we'd like you to in a a review Nesmith a memoir for the Washington Post the interest that and I said of course I'm interested in I told him this story of how months before without any for thought about any of this\nI started getting into the monkeys and I actually put this into the review and the Washington Post to its credit included this material it was just the weirdest thing that it was almost like retro causality in a way whereas if I was loose\nFor money or time this is why I'm saying that time is not what we think it is I was completely prepared for that opportunity because for reasons that no one\nCould understand I was getting into the monkeys but the reason seemed to be off in the future so to speak with my contention is it wasn't the future it's that everything is happening all around us at once which is why mental focus is so effective\nI was sixteen when the monkey started plane was there a long long time ago and if I remember one of the members was Mickey ... that's right who pleads shook his boy on television\nRight that's right and and still touring still touring you yeah who is still going that's absolutely that I Love them [laughter] and do you know the name ... gallon burger buddy chance I don't ... wrote a couple of books one called liquid luck oh of course All right I Know the book I Know\nHe he would conduct experiments still does in Las Vegas with groups of people ... ... each each trying to prove\nThat positive thinking in the mind has a lot to do with influencing things that happen that's right and and he is totally convincing these convinced me too that if you go into a situation like Las Vegas upbeat\nAnd you know just you know positive about things the odds are really high you're going to win\nYes and you know what's so fascinating about that is that outlook has been validated by Syria CSP research my hero J. B. rind pioneered scholarly ESP research at Duke University in the early Nineteen thirties J. B. is now deceased\nAnd one of the things that Jay be found that he just buried this in the foot notable book with its monumental\nThat when his subjects in the ESP lab and these were people tested under very rigorous conditions when they had a feeling of hopeful expectancy when they were upbeat when they were enthusiastic when they were a positive their scores\nSpiked when they were bored when they were down cast when they were fatigue their scores dipped and it was inevitable\nAnd spike followed mood it's the same thing that he says and the book\nIf you go into a situation any kind of situation doesn't have to be Las Vegas down in ... you know putting that black cloud over your head for whatever reason yeah he's not going to happen for you\nIt's not going to happen and the thing that I always tell people is and again this one of these familiar things but listen very carefully to it you must really wanted you must really want it if you're a person who's attitude is neither here nor there about winning in Vegas or the lottery or money or whatever\nIt's not going to work it has to be something that you really want which is why it's so important to me that surely identify your most heartfelt desires there's real power there because the power comes from an emotionally charged thought\nWe're talking with Mitch Horwitz his latest book is called the miracle club as a matter of fact we are going to tell you how you can get a membership and the miracle of a little bit later on in the program is website is his name all linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com it's amazing how well how did you\nDecide to write this kind of a book\nYou know was funny I had written a history of the positive mind moving a couple of years ago called one simple idea and I began to realize\nEvery chapter that I wrote every person who I talked about in the book I was using their methods I was road testing these things myself\nAnd I thought to myself look if I'm experimenting with these methods myself and if that's what's driving my historical research what am I right about the methods why don't I write about the steps what am I right about the techniques\nAnd it was a big step because a lot of historians are afraid to mask themselves as believers in what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and I just really wanted to share with\nReaders the actual hands on things I Do in my own life\nHow powerful is our human mind manage\nIt is powerful in ways that our generation is only coming to understand look we are realizing that things work out there like placebo surgery we're realizing that people can lose weight literally George\nAnd lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them things that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated and clinical experiments today I think this universe is ultimately mental that doesn't mean\nWe don't live under many laws and forces but if one can understand how much that means your thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs it the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have actual experiments that the thoughts change the brain your sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter so if fought\nChanges the brain and fought has to be something that extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nLook we're human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't that Iraq if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method it works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and then they feel dejected one of the things that I write about in the book\nIs that we live within a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces the law of mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by mass the mind is the same way circumstances\nAre going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we wouldn't we experiment very clearly and very carefully\nShe's the victim of a devastating

we talked about his latest book which is called the miracle club ... thoughts become reality will take your calls and your stories\nNext hour as well how does ESP fit into this Mitch you were talking about it briefly but ah I I tend to think there is a very deep rooted tie in here\nYeah oh there is without question you know we've experienced in this country about eighty years of serious\nPsychological research serious experiments that the ESP creek cognition telepathy and George the evidence is simply overwhelming and what we're seeing in the SP lab is that the mind\nPossesses extra physical qualities there are ways\nThat we receive and get and give information that go beyond the five senses once we've come to grips with the fact that the mind is extra physical that the mind\nHas an existence outside the sense a body it opens the door to all kinds of possibilities we realize we are not just material beings and it helps confirmed to us that\nOur thoughts to make a difference in the world we may be like sending in receiving stations we're always looking for people to help us with projects to give us a hand to meet us\nHalf way and as I was mentioning in the last segment J. B. riding the grade ESP researcher found that ESP result spike in the laboratory based on the enthusiasm of the subject so that gives you a different perspective on how important\nYour thoughts are what actually happens to you may be based on your emotions your enthusiasm your focus\nAnd you believe that you can just change your entire life this way get a better job maybe find the relationship you're looking for just about all that stuff\nI Do believe that but the here's the key thing and this is really the magic key if there is one behind all of our self help systems\nYou must want it with everything and you you must want it with passionate intensity and we often tell ourselves that we want things without scrutinizing and examining our convictions\nDo we really wanted for example we say we want a job when what we really want is security we say we want a new relationship when what we really want\nMaybe is is is something else you know to move to a different city or to have a different domestic arrangement or to somehow rearrange the furniture of our lives it's very important that we\nGet down to the essentials of what we really want before we put a label on it because I Would contend that what you want over time you're going to get\nDo people know what they want\nThat is really the key thing we tell ourselves well we want you know we say gee I Want a better job I Want romance I Want to live you know in this city versus that city but my\nUrging to people my urging people and this is something lister is can do right now is to sit down with a pencil and paper and for a mature stand sustained period of time really write down your deepest desires your deepest wants\nThink about this well on this be private about this don't talk to anybody about it being intimate and see if they channel in one direction discover what you want to or because sometimes we repeat things to ourselves by rote\nAnd they don't represent are really passionate heartfelt desires get in touch with your desires you may think you have but I Would contend that few of us actually have\nMuch how close you echoed the secret that story or is it different\nI ... it's different in some ways I have a lot of respect for Iran to burn and the secret but I rarely use the term law the traction because\nI don't believe we live under one mental super law I Believe that given the circumstances we live under we experienced many different laws and forces like the law of gravity as I was saying and the previous\nSegment and so I think it's a mistake to think that our minds and our thoughts are the only game in town so to speak\nThey are part of the game they're part of the game and that's important enough that's essential enough\nYou're right about how people travel back into time to help their current life yeah but can't that also be dangerous\nIt can and it's a very interesting prospect this is why I tell people be careful of what you're thinking about ... careful of what you're doing because you know we like to play games with ourselves and we'd like to say\nGee you know if I could travel back into time and give advice to my Fifteen year old self what would I say well my contention is you may be doing that all the time that may be happening all the time Lenny your time is very likely a very powerful illusion that we used to organize our lives but what we've discovered\nIn the hard sciences as well as over the course of testimony from centuries is that\nLife is intimate everything is happening now there is in and finish two of events occurring at once and we select among them\nWe are selecting among the events past present and future all the time and yet these things feel very real to us very set in concrete to us but I Would contend that when you think about going back and giving advice to a young herself\nYou may actually be doing that so be careful be careful we are granted perspective we are granted some perspective but use your mind use your thoughts carefully because things that you may think of as a novelty may actually be concretely we'll\nPut it all into Apple's stock that's where they come back well [laughter]\nWell who knows

there might have been another reality operative in his life a few minutes ago\nMitch what is the third day mental challenge\nThe thirty day mental challenge is something that I invite everybody to join me and it's very very simple and any coast listener who emails me I Will send them a little instruction sheet you basically right out a pledge\nThat for the next thirty days you were going to dedicate your mind to everything that as productive progressive forwarding you're not going to think of negative events of the past you're not going to think of unpleasant possibilities of the future you're going to think that every reasonable ambition\nIs within your grass it make up a grid of thirty days you do this for thirty days it's your private experiment just see what happens see what happens it sounds easy but it's not it's very difficult and if you fall off the horse you don't have to restart the thirty days you just get back on the horse\nThe ideas to just try to direct your mind in the direction of that which is positive and productive for thirty days see what happens when you give thirty days to the possibility of experiencing a whole different life and I will do it with you I Will do it with you and if you're having a hard time\nYou could write to me you can email me and say you know I really fell off the wagon last night and I'm there in the trenches with

whatever they need a willingness to a new job in a selection\nSomething people even right in and said please pray for my cats you know you sick and stuff like that in any way how powerful do you believe in and I will say I believe in this war since I've gotten emails back\nAfter the fact that people say you know so and so's thing was cured and this like that but how powerful the belief prayer is\nI really do believe prayers powerful and it's for this reason I don't think Mother Nature\nPlays cruel tricks on us there are instances and there are times in life where somebody is feeling\nSo depressed than facing such difficulty that they can't do the things that I'm prescribing they can't direct their minds in a positive way they are all kinds of methods and techniques I can give them but let's face it\nThere are times in life where we feel crushed by circumstance [noise] that's one prayer comes in that's when ... comes in prayer is an escape hatch\nFrom the difficulties of our own psyche from the difficulties of life's circumstances when we can do nothing else\nWe can pray and there's no wrong or right right way to pray it's an escape hatch from her own psyche so again I don't think we've been putting too cosmic framework\nThe tricks us I think we've been given away out when we can't use our minds in the way I'm describing there are times where people are suffering from addiction from depression from Greek and they can't do the things on saying there were times I Can't do the things I'm saying that's where ... comes in and I devote a special section to prayer in the

I ... I was reading some of their ... and many enough of these people were truly professional in their lives\nYou know one\nBecause there was evidence before the crash that something bad was about to happen I Know myself I Would have spoken up and said get me out of this debt trap but these those people Mr Horwitz above\nUpper middle class the all basically we remained mom no one spoke up their their very lives were coming to an end and yet you say a from a ... a higher exalted background that people should know but the that they were like many people in society\nThey they were conditioned to stay quiet and it ended up costing there are a lot there were twenty people killed Eighteen in limbo not one spoke up to say this has got to stop pull over now and they could have but they didn't like she does say if they went to their deaths\nSort of wrap all of this up um ... weather me in the city and seen my fellow city residents ... many of them\nGood enough but not getting ahead and then in ... Harry these upper middle class people not speaking up for themselves I'd like you to tide us together and so far as why to say it if I have to like sheep\nSo many people go to their dome and they just can't bring themselves to grab themselves by their lapels and just\nSpeak up for themselves and say gosh darn just let all of this stop and let us all come together and do something about it\nAnd let me let me ask you because we have the story the night it happened it was a tragedy for sure but what do you mean by should tell somebody to stop what was going on inside the limo ...\nThere are indications that the car was basically use my term coming apart that the uh people were saying uh amongst the victims 'cause they had cell phones that we can't we can't even hear each other next to each other or talk to the car was being calming very noisy and\nAnd literally coming apart at the scenes and you would think that intelligent people and many enough of for both of you these were quite professional people would noticeably\nHigher ... middle class of jobs where they should have had the smart the know how justice say I'm going to speak up here get this driver to pull over and I know a 'cause you've heard me before me teeth oh that driver would have pulled over no if fans or\nI wouldn't want him to be in a limo with you you would have stopped that guy\n... you know what there's a lot to unpack them with Keith is saying and of course I I read that same news coverage now you know there's a new age expression there are no accidents than I break with that expression I don't I don't abide\nBy that everything happens for a reason\nRight right one of the things that are right in the book\nIs you know as I've been eluding we live under many laws enforces we experienced many laws and forces of never including love accident including accidents birth for example now peer pressure as as Keith was alluding is an extremely powerful force than it can be a destructive\nForce one must never get caught up in peer pressure because it can be a kind of group mentality regardless of whether it holds you too where you've been born or it keeps you from speaking up if you're seeing something that you think\nIs dangerous it's vitally vitally important\nWith independent agency that doesn't mean you can escape accidents that doesn't mean you can escape tragedy but my contention is that the mind is\nOne vital element that participates\nThat participates in other things that are going on and it is extremely important\nTo exercise it at all times you're never without devices whether you're facing a crisis or based on the accident of birth and economic class I Can't tell you and I would never tell anyone that there aren't crushing forces socially and economically\nThere are but the fact is the mind is one vital tool and your belt that you can always use and it can make all the difference at a crucial moment it is one thing we think of ourselves as having mines that control cognitive and motor function and that's true but there's more to it than that there's more to it that that\nThe mind as extra physical properties that doesn't mean that it necessarily determines everything\nAnd every force that occurs or comes into her life\nBut it's one vital tool and my messages\nUse it use it always and everywhere and in every circumstance whether its environment as Keith was alluding to or whether it's a situation that you think is going to be\nHazardous never feel bound by peer pressure there is no more wanting force of your own will ineffectiveness in potency than peer pressure it must be escaped\nLet's go to Thomas a long way in California you know Hi Tom go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call very up beat interview hearing gal or I'm very grateful that you and ...\nAnd question I'd like to share a miracle short you know I regularly lesson to an audio program in which you match\nMarried her nap audio program as ...

this book is something that I Would give to my own kids to use it really does work\nWe briefly touched on your thoughts about people going back into time in order to help their current life how do you do that\nYou know Georgia it's simple as just focusing mentally on what for example you might want to tell\nYour younger self that's something that's familiar to us we often think of that as novelties so it's easy to picture I made the determination I read about this and the final chapter of the miracle club that once I had come to feel that linear time was\nBasically an illusion and everything is happening infinitely and all at once if you can actually enter into a relaxed meditative state and picture of yourself into the scene going back\nGiving advice to your younger self at whatever age maybe you want to avert a tragedy or disaster maybe you want to dispense a piece of advice it can change your life right here and now in the presence but be careful because sometimes things that we as experience\nAs challenges or tragedies also bring maturity to our life they also bring refinement to her life so you don't necessarily want to raise something that was a difficulty because that might have been a springboard to some sort of greater maturity or lesson so reflect very very carefully\nOn what you want to tell your younger self and then imagine yourself into that scene imagine yourself into that scene write down what you want to tell your younger self because by writing it down you'll be able to actually have some sort of a compass point or vantage point\nFrom when you can tell whether things are different and I think you will find that things will be different\nWhy do you say that it could be dangerous to do that\nWell because if we go back and we are race adverse cities we could be a racing something that taught us a vital are necessary lessons sometimes\nThe aspects of our lives that were most proud of came to us from adversity so we want to be very careful this is not a game this is not a toy is not something to play around with you want to be really sure that whatever the consequence\nYou want to go back and encourage your younger self to do something healthy unimportant and productive but don't think of it as just avoiding tragedy because tragedy can actually be a springboard to maturity\nNow here's the sixty four thousand dollar question Mitch ... or\nHow does it work that is the question and I don't shy from that question\nThe fact is I don't think we manifest things I think we select things I think as in the particle lab\nEverything in our lives as in super position and it becomes localized only when we focus on it as if we are almost drawing up a matrix grid and when we isolate a spot or a point in time on that grid\nWe experience it as being as vividly real as my voice that you're hearing right now so\nOur actual act of life is an act of selectivity what we emotionally and mentally picture rise and focus upon is the experience that we enter into because everything is happening at once and we go in and out of these things\nThe way a particle goes from a wave state and then it collapses into a localized particle state\nSelect very carefully timed is infinite and our minds our sensory tools are a measuring device by which we can help decide exactly what we're going to experience\nLet's go to Barry in Rock Hill South

chronic hunger\nGo back to the end of World War two when the un came into existence they recognize food not as a privilege but as a right I think that that's justifiable I don't see why they would even be a discussion about it frankly anyway that October sixteenth Nineteen Seventy nine fast forward the un created world food day\nTo day observance to draw attention to those who are hungry we have fourteen million youngsters every day or every night to go to bed hungry in this country that seems inexcusable especially when we go back to some of the stupid rules\nIn cities and communities around the country uh restaurants they want to give extra food to the homeless can't\nBecause of laws that make no sense to anybody with any common sense whatsoever\nSo here's where you can do to help today and going forward\nLocal food banks always need food in our country one in seven people rely on food banks as a primary or supplemental food source my God\nMany of these are working families who don't because of under employment of not being paid enough to satisfy the knees or a family can't afford groceries\nNeed the have help with their families needs the top requested items for food banks are healthy non perishable items high in protein like canned beans peanut butter rolled oats low sodium soups and vegetables and canned tuna\nOr and also one of the things you can do they support\nFarmer the family farmer small scale farmer a lot of family farmers unable to produce a variety of crops needed for their own survival these days and without that support they suffer from malnutrition themselves that happens when we were talking about what happened was it last week we were talking about the farmers in China\nAnd what's going on with them\nIt's really a very interesting is like the old days of futile isn't in Europe so here's something you can do on were food day go shop at a local farm the locavores support family farms\nDecember we'll talk about on our American family farmer pod cast is we care\nAnd by the way you can listen to what's going on\nOn the American family farm as I Try to support the American family farmer we have a weekly podcast that you can find an American\nFamily farmers show dot com want to know what's going on you want to listen if you're a locavore or you want to know what's going on in the form of how you can support the farm we have lots of good stories about successes on family farms that's where we do the show to help people who are on farms to need a little more help coming up with\nIdeas that's what that's all about\nAnd ah then the other thing you can do observe world food day is to raise money yourself\nTypically a number of food drives today and this week\nIf you don't know of any local food drives maybe you can organize one yourself great lesson it would be a good elementary and middle school lesson maybe for all schools actually teachers who are listening to this right now on your way to school may I suggest that you put together a food drive organized one\nIn your classroom and then you can give the kids are great lesson put all the food the school bus and bring it down to a local food drive\nAnd show the youngsters what's going on\nHunger walks some of them around the world today world food they dinners and food packaging rallies as well to help people who don't have enough food I Would say this would be something that ought to go on\nEvery day because this is a problem not just today I just this week not just this month every day pretty much everywhere even if you're in advance\nLiving in an advanced country like ours are the problem is a it's really pretty disgusting actually that we would have in our country so people can't afford the food and\nInstead of throwing it out fade into the pigs you feed it to people who need it that's it was it the homeless people are going up and down the street and garbage cans and you can't give them left over food my restaurant but yet we can let them walk up and down the street you know you're not a garbage can my God\nOh well they can get what they want as long as we're not they find civil forgiving than you know that that sort of this
