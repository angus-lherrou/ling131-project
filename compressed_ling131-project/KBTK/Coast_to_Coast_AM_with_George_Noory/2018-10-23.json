you with our special guest for the next couple of hours Robert Zubrin from of course the Mars Society Robert is also the president a pioneer astronaut accent of course the Mars Society as well as a senior fellow with the center for security policy\nRobert a study done research the fields of aerospace and energy it's got a PHD in nuclear engineering as well noted author one of his books how to live on Mars and we're going to talk about all things space and the next couple of hours Robert welcome back\nMy friend thanks for inviting me always a pleasure hobby Ben I'm pretty good pretty good at keeping to think what are we going to Mars\n[noise] um at this point it looks like we're going to go to Mars plan um either ... or one of us ... and we're one of its competitors takes a fair um space sexist pushing hard a following up their success with the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle with\nA developing their beer far rocket which will be fully be usable or to stage to orbit hundred and fifty tons to earth orbit vehicle that's equivalent to a Saturn five but fully reusable or that will give us the capability to go to Mars uh and\nIf they should um you know ... off the edge of the ice 'cause you know you must be ... next to the edge of the ice is um\nThey got a blue origin company by a lead by Jeff Bezos the owner of Amazon is a is coming up on his heels so uh we've got a new space race going on and I think that one of these outfits is going to get us to Mars right now\nYou know NASA is that was great work with its robotic planetary missions any space astronomy missions uh ... they work in that field is epic bought the human spaceflight program is dysfunctional\nUh they claim they want to go to the moon but they're not even planning a reasonable plan to do that and um so I think it it's going to be one of the new kids on the block that gets us there\nAre you happy that privatization is taking off the way it is and that NASA is kind of like feeding away\nI'm happy that privatization is taking off I Am not happy that NASA is a human spaceflight program as dysfunctional ah I'm not happy about that at all um the uh you know I ... it would be disastrous NASA's robotic\nSpace flight program and space astronomy programs became as dysfunctional as the human spaceflight program but\nI mean it's really sad to see this program they I mean that storm cabin in the Nineteen sixties\nDoing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I was at a conference in Florida a month ago where a high level NASA official that actually got up in front of the aerospace audience and said we're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\n[laughter] what what happened in Nineteen sixty nine\nWe're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThem [laughter]\nWhat what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you got ... maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember that to die off so they can help people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who don't that we went to the moon jumper joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's this thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station in orbit around the ... which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it's it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is gonna be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission I mean ... let me tell you what this they call this the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay [laughter]\nThe the the ... here's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal I Want to read\nYou an office in Saskatoon now you're gonna have to pay to build the building and you're gonna have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must do there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a bill by passing that had to deal and this thing\nThat I buy the ... and you probably saw me what you buy the swarm play and you probably want to sell me a lot\nBetter off with the swamp land than with this\n... ... you know with measles doing what he's doing fell ... sex are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching NASA just kinda and not do much anymore with manned space flights in its it's disappointing Robert really is\nWell it is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and ... built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon\nUh and and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible um I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we have a major deterioration in the quality the political class\nIn terms of its ability to execute great projects and ... and act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan\nA chaos and the the the you know so there it is but uh I gotta tell ya you know I was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while\nWould come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what what the incompetence who preceded us uh you know want it to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the mood I was hoping ... Stein would do that but he didn't he\nJust went along and I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance through a witness the flight of one of the falcons a at night to another\nTeam back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the guys that night\nUh they didn't know what it was he thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was spectacular to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time ah because shore we\nStarted the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get them to be usable so I'm\nBetter late than never and and here it is and and I got to tell you this thing that must kiss done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and and he's reduced the cost of space launched by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram perform us now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram\nTraumatic it's dramatic it's protect killer and it was\nDone on a shoestring compared to um what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems I mean it was done like for one tenth the money in one third of the time that any one of ... was accepting would be normal\nAnd this thing um the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space\nAnd a number of other advanced fields that people thought were hopeless uh so okay Bezos has his own money's got blue origin but we now have three small launch companies a firefly a vector space um\nElectron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars a two to field a small launch systems and it even goes beyond the the us space industry\nWe now have you shouldn't power startups getting funded because people you know they were looking at future parents all this is just never going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years and but\nPeople than say maybe it's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the ... and um I gotta tell ya\nActually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and I can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around the table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be in a place like Los Alamos sport Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably a start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what he's going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours next Gulf Coast to coast they\nAnd welcome back with Robert Zubrin from the Mars Society as we talk about space will to goals with Robert next hour Robert de you know ... don't you what kind of a guy is\nWell um [noise] what can I say he's an unusual guy a new like you meet a\nYeah although we can be a difficult at times uh I mean he has a sense of humor it's kind of dry and uh he he is\nUm [noise] uh okay look\nUm the thing to know about Iran is is this okay on the one side he well he he is very driven it's very hard working a A N T is\nA\nDriven to want to do something great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money he likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what he's about\nUh\nNow he he he really wants to do he wants to go down in the history books for doing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that\nHe doesn't just want to do great themes he wants to eternal gory for doing great deep so he's not Mother Teresa he can be selfish\nHe he um and he certainly um I'm\nNot above using people are and you know if you look at some of the things about him that um didn't come off so well like Kim getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand\nUm that that's the other side of it so you know a ... you know there is um\n... you know a self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it's it's selfish for eternal glory for doing great teaches you go about that\nIt's not exactly go it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology like the we had this is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great teach or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth you know uh\nUh when he gets to that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core to to fight the French because he he even though I mean the odds of war against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone\nSo you know that's mosque to a tea and um and and and so\nBut really um [noise] you know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I I think\n... the hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that is a person who wants to win eternal Korean Knight errant to goes out uh looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... that's what he's about\nBut you know um\nHow would you come from the just results Robert\nWell Jeff measles as much calmer a much more laid back um\nI don't know these cells I met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh and if you look at how the two companies are run a they reflect at\nA mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast or he wants everything done yesterday\nAnd um the company takes chances and thus far um they're winning 'em but it's certainly a\nThere they pushed very hard bees owes the model of his company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush the cells strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why it is limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise] um well in one sense it's obviously is up but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space sex is racing ahead of him so this is the you know ... the hair\nUm blue origin the tortoise\nAnd ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know measles is at least ten times as richest mosque okay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also want a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA effort the military base just doing it all with his own money\nOkay these shows\nYou know is the richest man in the world ah and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon's stock each year sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has unlimited time I'm mosque knows that I'm\nKnow in aerospace a cost just people times time or the quicker you just do something the cheaper costs people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no cost much less\nUh because uh you know space program is like writing\nTen years it would cost much more no cost much less uh because uh you know space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still or whether it's moving\nYeah that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in March what what's going on with some of these latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOh yeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European bought all these experiments or ex discoveries\nBy the way are being made now with a um something it's not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar and his radar that can look through the ground and seeing what's on the ground\nAnd um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water\nUh and um but it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment um it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars it has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place I think there's an underground water table on Mars uh\nAnd um you know on earth\nSome of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth\nAre still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the ground water is is as it was billions of years ago and they've been down there and if there was ever life on the surface of Mars would have retreated into that ground water and be there still\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American Mars Reconnaissance orbiter\nHas found glaciers on Mars at mid latitudes that is a a mountains of pure water ice and something like a a million cubic kilometers of\nPure ice covered by just a few feet of dust\nKnows it's right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it's as far south is thirty eight or a north in the northern hemisphere of Mars which find ways to same latitude to San Francisco\nSo imagine that there were glaciers\nIn San Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC you know that's the latitude that these things are\nAnd what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get out with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people this is strange some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um\nI think so there's there's two they there there's two different versions of it one\nIs the scientist saying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay\nContamination\nYeah well that's like saying if you go to France she won't know if the people there are French or not I mean the the ... because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean look if if if how do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did\nWell for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower this all this stuff that they built in the past well if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and they will be fossils of it\nHere is about to unfold on the American people ignoring what the last eight years have really been line\nSean

gravity you spin the spacecraft\nCrates and typical force that mimics gravity and that's a uh in my view or a a a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage in order to ah prevent\nThe deterioration of bone and muscle that you can't with 'em\nIn zero gravity long belongs to a long time so\nExactly 'cause if you you know anybody who just walks around on earth the you know not an athlete just a person that you know walks around the house goes to the store they they get somewhat of a workout 'cause they're carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on their feet and and and and and and ... ... you know and moving it around a\nA worse in space just floating around in zero gravity you don't get that\nAnd so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity for use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and zero gravity we can but if\nI commend artificial gravity for use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and zero gravity we can but if you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition\nThough there might be able to do anything for you\nRight and then the the the third question was electric repulsion yeah I Know a fair amount about electric position\nUm electric propulsion is using a electrical electromagnetic forces to accelerate ... pounds to very high velocity she'd get about ten times the exhaust philosophy with an electric roster that you can with a chemical roster\nThe problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot\nAnd that means that I'm your powers limited and therefore you're thrust is limited and what that means is that electric propulsion systems\nAre kind of like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from zero to sixty in a week I'm not terribly useful for short distance driving around town\nBut if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that went all the way around the world okay you Florida the car you know in San Francisco and um\nYou know a week later going sixty miles an hour and you've reached a the east coast and now you can go driving around the world because of your car and drive over water in this case but in any case now you you have a tremendous advantage in that your your your mileage is great\nBut if you're going from earth to Mars and actually takes longer to get there with electric propulsion than it does with chemical caution if because it the time it takes to speed up is longer than the time it takes to get there\nOn the other hand if you're going from earth to Saturn electric propulsion would get you there faster\nRobert if you had to pick one man going back to the moon or going to Mars which would you pick\nI picked Mars you would uh be costs you know I mean look we went to the moon fifty years ago or we're not going to inspire the next generation by doing things that their grandparents' generation did\nUh the science on Mars is far more profound we're going to discover the truth about the potential uh existence and diversity of life in the universe and barges got much more resources to compare Mars to the moon\nTo the choice in the age of ocean exploration Mars compares to the moon the way North America compared to ... you know Greenland was closer to Europe European scotch Greene long before they got to North America [noise] but it wasn't a place where you could build a civilization that didn't have all the different resources\nAnd ah so Mars is is you know it's\nA much richer world but you know here's NASA and frankly it doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars well then they say well then we'll go to them as well but I see is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars then\nGet on with they go to the moon don't come up with some other thing that's a halfway house you have to do before you go to the moon because if we can go to the moon fifty years ago we could go to them and now\nI can you believe that next July will be fifty years since we went to the ... the first time fifty years already rubber wears the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the moon and if anybody told me then that I'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I I I Would have thought they were crazy\nYeah I Would agree east of the Rockies Joe's with us Long Island New York I'm Joe go ahead Rob\nIt I'm Sorry they can get to go to them all but a couple of questions are in deep space\nUh when we send out these probes are what you are\nOr what would you be dealing with extreme heat even open space as opposed to the planet\nAnd would it be advantageous to us to kind of go to mercury or what some sort of probes and case back here we have a way a global warming due to maybe solar flares combined with CEO to increase was\nUh in other words what the spin off of dealing with the extremes heat and space help us to deal with the potentially back here and also what kind of person would profile are going to Mars\nUh how would you profile a potential candidate to travel on a ship come to Mars what type of personality looking for\nAll right let me take the questions one time or the first question it'd be hot and space if you're close to the sun um if you are a far away from the sun it's called\n... and ah if you're in earth orbit it kind of depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not [noise] um but um\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you ... you can ... the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so you kinda have to watch that uh but space itself\nDoesn't really have a temperature but certainly the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it and you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles people well okay\nHold on for a second the Robert we're going to hit the brake already school by fast food you Robert Ruben ... with us we'll be back will let them finish up your questions there and the interesting what kind of a personality would want to go to Mars will be back in the moment of coast to coast am\nPortion of your debt now called national debt relief at eight

did they like well\nI'm well there's all sorts of people that say they want to go to Mars uh [noise] um I mean quite literally and and some are people that are\nYou might well want on a crew a it's going to Mars and others not a chance that the caller asked what sort of people would I select to go to Mars\nAnd I'll tell you it's real simple it's the same sort of people that you would still like to go on a ...\nA a hiking expedition with you I'm a or an exploration ah adventure of any kind um they're the people who you know\nHave a high spirits are fun to be with a guy in the sense of humor a

when you want to take to Mars what's going on with the your August conference you're working on\nA well we're having another conference a in August uh or actually this year it might be in September in Los Angeles [noise] um it could ah it it's probably going to be at one of the major universities in Los Angeles [noise] um and ah\nI'm sure we're going to have all sorts of debates about things like is this lunar orbit gateway or is it a gateway or is it a toll booth okay\nYou know we're going to have that one out um you know we're going to have all sorts of presentations on the latest discoveries you know ... there's a marsh probe on its way it's going to land in November called inside and it's going to find out how geologically active Mars is so that's kind of land this November and we'll probably have\nUm a discoveries from ... um there's also a new space telescope that just got into orbit um a couple of months ago which will be reporting data discovering planets\nGoing around other stars or am I guess it will have discovered hundreds by them and you will prompt discover thousands words on 'em\nAnd it's called Tess um you know a will you know since we're going to be in Los Angeles will have a scientist from Jet Propulsion lab coming over and\nTalking about a um all the latest discoveries from the rovers on Mars and the plans for the next one's ah probably have space sex people talking about what they're up to I'm hoping to get little arch in people there too so we can hear from them\nOr maybe some from the ... the small entrepreneur companies like factor space just got funded by Seventy million dollars to\nThe small watches you know the we now have small satellites that can do what it used to take big satellites to do and so small rockets make a lot of sense I'm and I'm a I myself I'm involved design of mission to go to the moon ground penetrating radar\nWith for satellites each of which are the size of a shoot them um and so little launchers like this could really play a role\nAll right let's take a few more calls for you was the first time caller Armand in a bell gardens California go ahead Armand\nYes good evening George did you and your guest I just wanted to put something on your radar screen so to speak and that is that you may not be aware of this but there's a whole new paradigm for water planetary water on not only earth but on march\nIf you're interested in learning more about it you can go to jail water I. M. G. L. dot com like international geo water international and the reality is that it's already been well demonstrated on this planet\nBut the water comes from them that well below at whatever you got the ... the planet fractured\nThat water that hydrogen and oxygen elemental hydrogen and oxygen and make its way to the surface to move back in areas of the ... the ... the structure that happens quite often\nAnd on Mars the same effect is there in fact\nThe largest volcano endless solar system is Olympic moms are bars which is over eighty thousand feet tall just ... digits there was a cold they're on top and that's what ... provide Scott city or lava flows to happen\nSo that's really where the water has always been on Mars and that's where the water is on this planet and\nIt's time I think for us to start factoring that is true our calculation\nIt's been on Mars and that's where the water is on this planet and it's time I think for us to start factoring that is true our calculations for Mars trip\nWell said rubber what do you think\nWell I I it sounds interesting we certainly know there's a lot of water on Mars we found the legs found glaciers and there's probably more to find so I think he's on the right track\nDo you think we are the Martians that a long time ago either\nOrganisms flu hear from you know shop the media writes a slow off the planet or or maybe they had a full blown civilization long time ago and the ... I think\nI think the former is is this a good chance is true or not civilizations but a microbes on on meteors a because Mars um well a couple things first of all life appeared on earth almost\nImmediately after it could which either means one or two things that life can evolve very quickly from chemistry or that life was floating around in space and as soon as the earth was cool enough\nFor life to to prosper here the ... it landed in the seats to cold as it were um\nThe and now if you think about that then you say here's Mars nearby it's\nBeing hit find meteors knocking chunks offsetting I'm flying and hitting the earth were hit by Mars meteorites all the time [noise] um\nIf life could evolve quickly\nOut of chemistry it would've on Mars Mars coup before earth to Mars had liquid water before or did so life is is is a quick study evolving rapidly from\nChemistry it would've occurred on Mars first and then it would have landed here\nSo there is a good chance that keen for Mars the the the the a and also that is supported by the fact that we find no organisms on earth no free living organism simpler than bacteria and bacteria really pretty complicated they have this ...\nSure of DNA and are in a whole alphabet for transmitting genetic information um you know or imagined you you've found a um an ancient manuscript that I had a complete alphabet along with all the punctuation marks and everything and\nUh it could not possibly be the first written document that they would have to be more primitive things before you know the complete alphabet and punctuation and comments and paragraphs and all this had been worked out\nSo uh but bacteria have all that so that suggests that they came here already fully developed it could've come from Mars or maybe both earth and Mars\nGotten in interstellar space I just lost his how did you get interested in all this Robert split Nick that did it for yeah\nYeah well I was already somewhat interested I I was an early reader I was five when Sputnik flu and while to the adult world split it may have been a terrifying event to me it was just great ah because what it was proving was that the um\nThe space hearings are stories that I was reading we're going to be true and I can remember reading about uh like it a space dog in my weekly reader and later ah I'm ... and ... the next space dogs and you know I'm I have a dog today her her name is ... and\n\nOr say it's\nWhat do you speak when you\nSometimes you get to this\nAnd I mean we just live on Ninety seven point\nThe big Tucker from the Ninety seven point once they talkers studios online at big talker radio dot com and from your smartphone with a big talker I mean all the just got an Williams\nOvernight in five to today Tuesday will be very bleak party with her showers you mean jobs Dark Knight forty one I use a firearm and somebody once used a lot of these guys and asking showers and\nIt's you know ... from Dr germ loaded on fifty by Tuesday Donald\nSeventy seven point one of the big soccer is KBC Jay Katrina village Flagstaff Prescott Ninety seven point one the big talk to her more stimulating talk [noise]\nDigging into the death of a shell game I'm Carmen Robert Fox news turkey says it would cooperate at the un and other international bodies requested an independent investigation and just the death of journalist your mom because she'll be Turkish president or to one will stick to the parliament about an hour from now\nAbout attacking side of the investigate than expected cutting pay and Iraq but hey or the as evidence or have according to the taxes that they are I think that's supposedly have\nWent to trade what happened in the country that exactly I mean we think today to be the thing is I'm kind of clean to take it up and they got them out to help pay that involve his whole test\nAnd then ... and they may be well rounded\nOn Saudi Arabia I had come clean about what has happened\nSky news reporter Deborah ... and assembled Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said earlier today the investigation into can show he's killing will produce the truth about what happened President Trump says he does not completely believe that the Saudis have said so far\nIs on the campaign trail last night this time in Houston something for a man that he wants the head of the arch rival Sen Ted Cruz a man he called lion dead\nI'll tell you what nobody has helped me more with your tax cuts with your regulation\nAt our senator\nCruz faces a tough reelection bed he's only seven percentage points ahead of his Democratic rival better Beto O'Rourke\nA manhunt in Salt Lake City police are searching for the man suspected of fatally shooting a female college student at the University of Utah last night we say the man is thirty seven year old Mel then Roland he's a convicted sex offender and Dow futures plunging this morning down\nTwo hundred and thirty four points this Fox News [noise]\nThis is ...

defense against sickness in misery inspired by visiting critical Health News dot com where you can purchase modular nutrition packs and see the yourself how good you can feel\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are are vying mentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans mean you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affects certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nUm there is a researcher out there Michael J. our who categorized these environmentally sensitive people um and what he found was people who are environmentally sensitive have you know long standing allergies chronic pain for tea migraines fibromyalgia and just an overt\nSensitivity to light sound like you're a city and smells more than maybe me and you do\nSo I could walk into a room and be fine other people could walk into the same room and they smell cologne from all over the place to get\nAshes [laughter] so he's environmentally sensitive people actually have way way way more paranormal experiences than the general population um there's those higher it's a really high number\nAnd what the thought is is these environmentally sensitive people are picking up on whether insects Darnell magnetic fields more than the general population in other words they have a battery antenna or biological radio\nAnd the electromagnetic spectrum than other people so we all are we all have radios with basic equipment to tune into things but some people have really really really redefined are sensitive radios\nAre and they're picking up on things and that and detecting things in the environment that normal people don't pick up for the general population doesn't\nSo this ability to truly experience paranormal phenomenon it's it's more likely to be detected a registered among this group and I think that's a fascinating thing so we have environmental sensitivity which there's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real I think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environment\nOh sensitivity which there's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real I think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environmental sensitivity so there's science behind it and then there's also sign saying these people are having ... counters why is that\nIn that kind of where we go a little further into that\nTo some of these people Brandon realize how sensitive the yard to picking up these things I mean do they know they get it\nI I think they do it and when I go out there and I ... my research was done I had I talked to a lot of people who are environmentally sensitive and what you find is\nYou know not only or do they pick up on things or have way more paranormal experiences but it's genetics so their mom did to wear their dad and then their grandma and so forth and so on so this is something\nKind of like most you know genetic diseases or or what not this kind of passed down from generation and listen they know they're sensitive to the environment um\nJust by walking into places some people\nYou know like I said get rashes um they can be under neon lights some people are almost allergic to electricity or so these types of people just experienced a different world and and believe me they know it affects them probably more negatively than it does positively\nYou know you talked about some of the reality television shows Brenda my a criticism of them because they always seem that they have to have some kind of ... Leon donor\nBecause it's television and you know they don't want to do their thirty minute or one hour program and not have anything happen so looks like they create these things and I think that kind of hurts the credibility of some of these uh ...\nYeah I think yeah I think it it it really does too because it implies that either people are\nMisinterpreting normal things or there's over fraud and um you know every ... those those people who do this on a regular basis and are genuine do you know out of ten locations that you go to you might have one experience\nIt's really impossible to have you know thirty or forty experiences every time you go to a location 'cause then it's your money in the waters and I and then you kind of lean towards that that fried type of\nThing will so we've we've talked about the individual who might have the ability to spot grows to fuel ghost more than others but what about the ghost itself or there's some does that come back more often than others or because they have an ability to do that\nUm I think it's really\nGuess which one is stronger in ... when you think about it is the person's ability to sense that goes if if I'm really sensitive to it\nGoing to pick up ghostly encounters a lot more than everyone else so I might pick up on a ghostly\nEncounter a civil war soldier I'm very often if I'm really\nSaying I mean a good a good radio or real good radio probably from she crane has the ability to pick up a weak signals from radio station ... isn't that much that way with the person that if that person is a good receiver\nHe or she may be more apt to pick up these grossly things\nExactly yeah exactly so\nYou know ... and ... and that that kind of boils down to the environmental sensitive person\nUm they're going to have way way way more goes the encounters and um so I think it has to do fear prior question I think it has to do mainly with the person not so much that goes to encounter the environment but you have to ask you know hey I'm an environmentally sensitive person I pick up on all this stuff\nYou know I go from place to place to place throughout my day however\nOne location I'm picking up a lot of\nUm having a lot of goes the phenomenon happened to me um the places pretty active whereas in other places it so then you start asking yourself why why that place and and why not the other places um so then you have to go into why is the location have more um paranormal phenomenon\nThat other locations\nYou know it's like those antennas we had the rabbit here was you know why is this configuration picking up channel thirty three and this configuration is that\nYou know what I'm saying you have to figure out the right combination of things that happen for um the TV to show up in a clear picture and the same with ghostly encounters you have to figure out the right sort of ingredients\nAre variables that line up the habit goes to counter location is one person has to 'em and then there's there's probably other ones that\nI you know we haven't really identified at this point but the person not only of their sensitivity but their internal ... electric or consciousness about all this stuff really plays into it and it's really fascinating to me at least\nYeah it really is I remember when my dad brought home a better TV him to do was the kind that didn't just move with the rabbit ears but it had like a little uh knob on it and you click\nAnd brought into signal better that way too and I thought for use this technology amazing how times have changed\n[laughter] I remember those too so [laughter]\nDo you know or have you come across demonic spirits in your work\nUh no I haven't and I'm I get that question a lot though the the team of question seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so\nI think you know when you have a ghostly counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's great uh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience was it good weather the bad weather the positive with that this was at that\nI think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's\nDemonic mhm demonic and team and it's\nMore of a religious perspective than it is sort of um you know like a a scientific perspective\nUsually whoever classified this is a demon or um you know a regular goes\nI think there's more of a religious pills to it um that's where I usually when I meet Steven knowledge is they're they're very religious as well um so I think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience\nUm and some people perceive it as good or bad I might perceive one experience being really positive you might have the same experience can be terrified and believe it's negative and then kind of you go towards the more demonic part of things\nSo I I really just enjoyed not enjoy it but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the theme and label on anything\nWell with Brenda ... his book is called the ghost studies is website called ... dot com of course linked up the coast to coast am dot com results on Facebook and Twitter as well we

you know who who we are as people are are personality our memories are um everything that we are um are after we die you know what happens to that\nRight or some people will say that we're just computers and when we die everything of who we are memories or it just says to exist\nUm and that's kind of mainstream science says you but when you look at things\nIf consciousness survived death that goes in it and it continues to exist it's it could maybe it really be in the environment to some degree\nI think when needed maybe like ... example with the husband when needed he can sort of resonate or or link up with the consciousness of his past wife\nSo I don't think it's a pecking order as much as you know someone just really need something and then they sort of resonate with the consciousness of of a path loved one and then these experience maybe happen\nSo yeah you know I I really believe that there's obviously things in the environment that we don't know about and the consciousness\nAnd then these experience maybe happen\nSo yeah you know I I really believe that there's obviously things in the environment that we don't know about and the consciousness I'm electromagnetic fields all this stuff that really happens in the environment\nIs is really important uh Michael pursing or who recently passed away it was a neuropsychologist basically said and he did all the the numbers behind this but that the environment holds enough energy for every\nEvery person that ever ever lived their consciousness to exist at it\nUm which means we have access to memories from Abraham Lincoln to Billy the kid it's it's all out there and the environment has enough energy to store all that and then maybe some people can just connect with that or resonate with that and that's when he was great experiences happen\n[noise] what do you see the skeptics Brandon you see these people who have these encounters or mentally unstable or something even worse\nYeah unfortunately I think you know when someone tells you a ghostly encounter um a lot of people will just kind of say oh you're crazy and they kind of say\nJokingly but it really makes the other person feel like they're you know they might be crazy I'm so ... you know what I usually tell people who who skeptics\nOr things like that I usually just basically kind of go over listen you know in in my experience it's all I Do all day is diagnosed mental health and and um you\nKnow you see at all\nYeah I mean my job I I worked in the ER for seven years so I just did behavioral health assessments on med floors in the ER and I've I've done probably five\nThousand assessments him over the course of ten years um so I Know how to parcel out you know significant mental health issues and all these real life and counters that I've come across\nUm Ninety nine point nine percent of them are from people who were genuine and had a subjective paranormal experience that's huge\nYeah you know and and I think that it's easy to say oh you're crazy or your this or you're that or your unstable or you're losing eating or you're drinking too much or withdrawing or whatever the situation is\nBut listen to it in my professional opinion a lot of these ghostly encounters are the the there are genuine and the people's eyes it's not the result of mental illness\nWell I've always found that skepticism as healthy as long as opposed to skip the cousin open mind\nMhm exactly exactly you know it's it's really easy to beef you know a steadfast believer or a steadfast skeptic right\nBecause you can just in golf yourself and whatever your reading journals magazines books and it's really easy to sort of said on everything is\nEverything is not a ghost or everything is it goes it's being in between an open minded is the most rewarding and challenging because you have to take both sides you have to read the skeptical stuff and you also have to read that believe the believers stuff and you have to have common sense in a way and sort of parcel out what's you know what's\nFraud are fake or just people being overzealous and then come up with your own conclusions and that's where you're right the open mindedness part of the central when it comes to being involved and apparently\nI was sick for a pretty much a majority of my life\nWhat change do\nYou know I I\nWhen people would tell me and I was really interested in Paris I college like I said before but I never had an experience so I always kind of thought well these people who are having experiences maybe they're just misinterpreting things and just getting it wrong\nSo when people would tell me experiences I Would kind of sit there and that they're talking I won't even listen to him I Would just sort of go over how to debunk yet or what could be happening\nAnd then I just sit back and you know I'm going to start listening and I started listening and I'm like oh okay and then I started picking up books like um Carl Young's collective unconscious show drags stuff I'm ... and Harold ... life feels\n... Raman Moody's work\nYes exactly a near death experience at all this stuff and you start reading it and you go wait\nA minute there's actually this might be happening and then you go deeper down that rabbit hole and you're reading research articles about untangle man and and then you kinda go wait a minute this is actually somewhat possible\nThen you know as far as ... the and things like that I mean the research on that is growing every year um I I Know every year I'm reading more and more journal articles which statistically give credence to the idea that ... the N E S P and the sigh phenomenon is legit\nAnd then you're like whoa wait a minute if all this is saying this than these ghostly encounters could be possible as well and that's kind of what led me into it from a skeptical to more of a believer part a thing\nField sneaky decisions don't take singer and\nDoes it kept ... or ... message ... by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration project yellow light no ice and the ad council\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nBoston you saw the\nNinety seven point one them being maybe TK Conchita village Flagstaff press\n\nThe president calls it a national emergency I'm Carmen Robert Fox news more than seven thousand migrants from Central American ten ten you their march towards the U.

to the environment and having an experience with some guys\nYou know there's that intelligent haunting that's sort of like the cream of the crop you know those types of things are harder to explain in in sometimes that falls into an earth ... spirit but I don't I don't necessarily think they hang around in the walls and kind of watch us in the way\nUm you know just like when we walk into a hunting building it's not like a zoo where we have to you know call out for that goes to come out and you know try to encourage them er instigate them by yelling at them\nYou know it it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that there's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environments resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling\nGoes come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it\nWe don't teach in Rochester New York Yankees\nYes I'd like to ask about possible early imprint teams on the brain that might explain to an extent why people\nSee ghost like others and I've seen film of the baby ... ships being fed by humans with hand pump it's made to look like the mother still wouldn't return to the wild the chicks noted key in\nOn a mother conned or are you mentioned the window we're who was searching for the pumpkin and news wife appeared and then goes gone\nI've never had any experience like that but the closest I've had over in the many years I'm now sixty three I Will rub my eyes and various ways all different kinds of figures\nWill appear before me a lot of figures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have a occurred within me a different figures in all different kinds of apps and some of them quite grotesque\nAnd I'm sure that those are not close by definition but just kind of bringing us together and closing a one about imprint teens that lake with a window we're uh seen his wife saying look uh uh in the back of the garage I Can't imprint teens\nCan people be so emotionally attached to me like a husband who was white that he would see his wife worse than the rest of us would not and maybe I in my life would be things that the rest of you would not\nMhm yeah yeah it's it\nI don't think that's a tough one to answer I I think that you know I it's a little bit with a widower they were talking about if a little bit like he is resonating with something in the environment that's why he's seeing his wife he's not seeing Abraham Lincoln or whoever else\nSo it specific to him there's a there's sort of a connection to him you know as as we're driving down the street in our in our cars others radio signals all around us but if I turn my radio stations in Ninety two point five\nAnd you know as as we're driving down the street in our in our cars are there's radio signals all around us but if I turn my radio station to Ninety two point five I only pick up Ninety two point five because we're matching frequencies so with a husband and wife with with ... and a mother they\nMatch frequencies and that's one of these sort of experience happened as far as an imprint goes I'm if I'm understanding that the way you're you're describing it ... there is I mean Carl young had this idea of collective unconscious\nSo were all born with these archetypes and the sort of a blueprint for how to really manage life\nUm so we're sort of imprinted um with with with these archetypes and and with sort of ancestral beliefs that are common throughout every culture that's happening\nSo this could be me here at Ohio or you know um people in other countries we all have similar sort of\nVision and stories and things like that so I think we're all imprinted I'm In a grand gesture but it could be more specific for cultures it could be more specific for families could be imprinted I'm with certain information so you pass that down to your family\nUm so it could be more micro then macro when it comes to this collective archetypes there out there so I think there is something to the imprint I I I couldn't answer your question differently but that's sort of my best guess at it\n[noise] it does your religion kind of changed your views about are these ...\n[noise] yeah I I think it's it it changes are using it basically changes our perception of an experience so you know you can have someone who is a devout religious person have the same experience as someone who is not a religious person might perceive that\nAs more of um like we talked about earlier I deem man or an angel or I'm a of a a sign from from God or aside from a deceased person that they love\nUm whereas a person who doesn't have that religious tell to it might experience that I simply\nYou know an experience or or um a mundane thing or ambiguous stimuli so everyone's everyone's past sort of influences how we perceive any sort of ... paranormal phenomenon\nUm and that's why we talked about before you know the believers are automatically going to go to whatever they believe in and if they believe in earth bound spirits everything is that are found spirit or so I think perception religion uh they play a huge part how we perceive a ghostly encounters appeared on the phenomenon\nHave you ever witnessed an extra ...\nNo I never witnessed that would you like to um [noise]\nAs long as it's not yours [laughter]\n[laughter] you know it was somewhat although I did interview a while back and and I can't remember what I said but I was kinda like yeah I'd love to have an experience like that\nAnd then someone emails me and says careful what\nYou wish for those types of thing yeah exactly [laughter] so I don't wish to be part of an exercise but scientifically are worth my fascination I'd love to sort of be part and sort of gain some information from that or knowledge\nI Am very curious about executions jumps and you know how they can get this demon disappearing demon on the person's system and you know be gone and it

a car crash but she's getting visitation Sally how often are these visitations occurring\nShe's she's not there anymore okay we'll get your reaction to that brand and what do you think's going on\n[noise] well that that's actually becoming more and more common um and I've heard more and more stories about this the last ten years but this this idea that\nYou know this is somehow um goes are utilizing electric electrical equipment to communicate so that's like phones tax emails these types of things\nUm you know typically people will report they'll get hang ups from a family members number who's been deceased for whether it's five days or five years\nUm then they'll get text messages from them you know after their death or you know these types of things and there's a there's a book out there that I'm a pair psychologist Dr column Cooper rose cause telephone calls from the dead which encompasses a great ...\nLess a bunch of these um phenomenon that are happening and then there's phantom menace messages but just recently came out as well which goes over this as well\nIt's hard to really know that to me I mean listen to the idea that um\nGhosts or consciousness or wherever you want to call it is ... electrical electrical equipment has been going on for a while so you know to to know the exact or how that's happening I'm not sure but anytime we talked about this numerous times anytime there's some sort of trauma or crisis or life threatening events\nLike she was talking about um it increases the probability of these types of things happening I'm so we we the only thing we can do is try to see these consistency there's similarities and then try to find the answers as best we can from the back and\nHow do you change skeptics mind Brandon can you\nUh [noise] I think you could um put some some doubt and education in there about what could possibly be happening\nOr it's it's a challenging\nIt's challenging because you know at this point go start measurable phenomenon\nAnd the paranormal it's difficult to study in a sort of a logical scientific way and this is mainly because paranormal experiences are you know there are radical their episodic\nThey're poorly documented um their random and they're not repeatable it will which is essentially it's everything that the scientific method hate\n'em for these things are are tough and and that kind of why most people go into its fried or mental illness or imagination um\nYou know when it is on a cop out them to be able to just to see the\nI think it's an ... yeah a cop out would be an easy answer to it\nSo that's the idea is if it's if I'm presented with something that I don't know the answer to um rather than spend hours and hours of researching it I can just stay out of the person's misunderstanding or it's fried or over active imagination\nAnd then I could go on living my life in my normal views and it doesn't blow my mind at any kind of way so\nIt's an easy way to sort of give an answer to something that you know it's it's pretty mind blowing phenomenon um but you know there's all this this stuff out there that that some people point to as evidence like pictures a BP's um but there's really no fall up after that\nUm and then those things nowadays are easily fake\nI I think really if and this is kind of what I tell people out in a paranormal investigator is is you got to it's about collecting data about sample sizes it's about being consistent and what you do and that was over how you that's how you progress or advance of field\nYou know similar questionnaires at all these people are using when they do\nBeing consistent and what you do and that was over how you that's how you progress or advance of field you know similar questionnaires at all these people are using when they do investigations similar methods\nUm you know if sample sizes huge in academia and was skeptics as well is that you know if if you have a sample size of three hundred people that's pretty impressive if you give questionnaires if every paranormal team gave a questionnaire to somebody and they did a hundred investigations a year and there's\nYou know I don't know of\nThree hundred paranormal teams out there your sample size is getting pretty big and then academia takes notice because you have a hundred thousand questionnaires that are just waiting to be analyzed and then you start getting some variables are um some similarities inconsistencies and then you have a measurable phenomenon\nSo you know it's it's hard to argue I'm with someone who has a close mine but if you could just push him towards a piece of research or a book or something like that and maybe they pick it up\nThen that helps you know and that goes for the opposite end to what people are just adamant believers there's there's things you can push a more towards the little with which is to me is the best place to be\nLet's go to Tom truck driving in Pennsylvania I'm going\nBy how are ya greet them

pain was caught\nStill we all know that ultimately are redemption lives with us more specifically you redemption lies with you free yourself for mental slavery stop allowing others the outside world and even your own tendency towards shamed and dictate your emotional state instead find your redemption\nI think so made a great point America is run on small business it's not run on all of these ...

there are people say oh we still haven't got enough it isn't about whether it's an effort isn't enough it's about perspective\nAnd to listen to some there will be really bad guys who's gonna by the
