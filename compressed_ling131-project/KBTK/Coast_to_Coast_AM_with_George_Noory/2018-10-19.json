that was back in my body but ah I wanted to tell you that it was a glorious experience and I've had many that was really one of the first\nAnd I I learned a lot from that I learned not to let my to teach me how to swim for one thing that's probably in the mail message from that\nExactly it's a scary thing I got to tell you the same thing happened to me when I was a kid except I didn't have an agility experience I was with my father's brother my uncle he was a the twins and we're walking in a lake\nAnd ah I'm side by side next to my uncle and uh I hit a hole in this lake in just like you down I went to must have been about eight years old Joyce\nAnd I'm gone I and I thought this is it I'm dead and now we're back something upon me\nBack up I've popped right back up and then my uncle didn't even know I went under just kept walking but it was the weirdest feeling but I thought that was it for me it was a strange feeling\nCorrect I wanted to tell you I don't know if you ever went to my website but I was home lots of times Oh thank you I was at the world Trade Center\nWhen nine eleven occurred because my husband and I had an apartment very club through like a thousand feet from some of the world Trade Center and we moved there about a month before buildings came down gosh\nYeah is there a month and on the day we moved and Jack and I looked up and the world Trade Center with towering over our little building I liberty court and I said you know we had to each other boy the thing comes down we're finished well exactly a month later they come down as you know and we were\nWe had to leave the building that because it was unsafe to be there so many people in that area had to leave but we came back a few days later when it was safe and I had the most phenomenal experience and that's in my Web site where I'm\nGoing to happen I I I actually had gone to sleep and that was awakened until it to go to the living room\nAnd to help people to cross over because they were coming through it created quite all in my building and then my apartment and people who were had just died were coming through and being released out into the onto the harbor by the statue of liberty that was Battery Park\nSo that was one of the many incredible experiences I've had and thousands of people see they just kept coming coming I guess you know\nAre you still out in that area Joyce\nWe saw that apartment when my husband passed away and then now I'm In Florida\nBut uh just like so many incredible things that people would just try to remember some of the things that happen to them I think most people say well if it was just something that just happened but write them down recording your dreams as I'm sure your your next guests has got to tell us\nBut write everything down and try to analyze what you're experiencing the best way to develop your yes pay is to try to remember and to try to record with you're experiencing and really happen that way it open up more of that that consciousness it'll be able to help other people as well\nSo that that's my primary recommendation record your dream to record your experiences\nWow so that's that's my primary recommendation record your dream to record your experiences\nI had a I don't know if I should if you're ready for me to tell you another one of a one my phenomenal experiences about a\nLot of money yeah sure absolutely\nOkay trucks thank you I have never heard of ... but I had an avid about maybe four years ago I had this out of body experience where I did astro travel which I had\nReally no memory of doing ever before I think we all travel and we just forget it but we don't know about it but this was unusual because I went to a um a Tibetan llamas story and to say this\nLama whose name was ... and you know in Tibet George on the day the baby is born that's the first name he was born on Tuesday says named Tuesday lob\nSang in ...\nAnd if you go to his website it's a lot saying ramp a dot org\nBut he came to me and I went on this phenomenal trip to\nIslam history and he had a the ability to answer many of my question is that this man had many walking experiences supposedly he was over many hundreds of years of age he had taken different bodies on the last one more out he took a new body on and he was living as an Englishman\nAnd his final incarnation on the earth and the Nineteen eighties so I was at Islam hysteria and it was phenomenal and I came back to my body brought me back and I was waking up\nHe said to me don't forget my name and I had never heard I couldn't remember it but my husband was there and I said jak before I wake up please write this down and\nI spelled it out ... and I misspelled it slightly put an H on it or it didn't belong and then he was a lot of things gone but I went to his website and that was blown away because he has written\nMaybe a couple of hundred books that are free anyone go to his delicious\nYeah extremely cell and just really an amazing amazing man and not only was he a doctor but he was also it just so many different incarnations it makes you realize that we don't really have to die like St your main also was walking and George do you believe that that's possible you can take on\nA further uh incarnation\nI think George many things are possible mhm really do I mean I'm I'm Still wrestling with the\nLiving in dying

pictures here we've had a camera or two on his neck I took a lot of pictures so I have a lot of ...

All right so there's a\nTheory and a half for you ladies and jets today friday the nineteenth his national ... day\nMammography day is a like a cousin to breast cancer awareness month both committed to women self care but the nineteenth of October set aside as a special day to encourage women\nTo be proactive\nAnd to make an appointment to have your ... mammograms or heat it early breast cancer detection early detection means early treatment the difference between life and death there though a lot of controversy care about this mammography use or how they are done\nThe forces and really do is on the bus around yeah and they're also too late\nFor the most part if you've got the by the time if using them anymore if you use an MRI it's different but\nThe ... that are done from what I understand I remember my ah my first and only wife died after suffering Twenty one years was staged for breast cancer and she had had a memo graffiti didn't find it and it was three or four months later she had pains in her back\nShe went to have it examined and then she had her breasts examine and bingo\nBut the stuff had started when she had her first mammography so\nI'm not suggesting I don't have a done\nI mean it depends on where the tumor start in a restaurant and so they they they usually start in the ... that doesn't mean that they have to\nYeah right yeah\nHey I had an MRI I'm\nA little uh one of those full body scans know dump Dr ken and had one of those ... has the Hodgkin's lymphoma the two years later I had Hodgkin's lymphoma I mean you know ... so\nWhat but what happened when you went there when they see nothing nothing right yeah right anyway\nThe history of mammography day goes back to Nineteen Thirteen when German doctor a German doctor detected breast cancer with X rays\nRobert and I'm Sorry Albert Solomon who is a surgeon in Berlin used an x-ray machine to see breast cancer in three thousand mastectomy samples back in Nineteen Thirteen\nFast forward in Nineteen fifty six radiologist in Houston improved a mammography imagery machine Robert Egan Houston based radiologist introduce specialized film for mammograms result and you're better imagery and detail\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy one\nZero mammoth griffey introduce for commercial use is zero memo graffiti was commercially introduced as a method of providing better quality images of the chest wall\nAnd then moving ahead to Nineteen eighty eight Congress approved mammography funding Congress passed legislation providing funding for yearly mammography screening isn't Medicare\nBenefits and then uh in two thousand digital mammography was approved by the FDA as a um approved the first full field digital mammography system\nSo you're too young at what age Kara are women supposed to have their first mammogram I've forgotten\nAlthough maybe it is not anything now I I don't I think starting it like forty five forty or forty five is when they start saying it would be that to get them but I don't think you need\nTo there are many cases of breast cancer this start certainly before the forties\nBut I think generally when you go to the gynecologist they also do a breath check up when you're there and not you know clay an annual thing so I think that's what gets you through until you're forty five one is that there are of a re\nExamining your your breast locally just feeling to\nSit in a game ahead of him around yeah there's no with hands it's not any kind of scan or anything like that or\nIs that enough you comfortable with that\nI I mean it's not the most comfortable experience\nBut I mean yeah you know there's two ways of ... and I make you feel a real fear ... is not comfortable in that somebody's got their hands over your breasts and there's there's nothing good that happens afterwards\nAnd I I mean I'm personally I think that they know what to feel for obviously I guess there could be something smaller that maybe they're not able to detect my family personally doesn't have a history of breast cancer so I ... ...\nI guess there could be something smaller that maybe they're not able to detect my family lives in LA doesn't have a history of breast cancer so I ... and that's the only worried about it um knock on wood\nBut uh yeah I mean I think for the most part they're able to detect that just with hands I mean there there have always been things to where you're supposed to kind of personally keep an eye on it and not just rely on the doctor you know your body the ... the the L\nSomething different that when you kind of go and tell the doctor about it but I I think for the most part it works OK\nMhm interesting factoid on the uh you're talking about the X rays and the the the fifties and read the history of all of it yeah yeah um what I found out when I went through the Hodgkin's is that the Hodgkin's cancer cell is so weak\nThat they found out in the fifties there were taking X rays of patience\nAnd every time they took an X ray the next X ray they would notice less cancer cells\nAnd they finally realized that the low level radiation people that had Hodgkin's for people that had ... you know at the low level radiation of the X ray was actually killing the cells\nReally match Halloran week my shows are so nobody should die from Hodgkin's not ... not a little bit different deal because that spreads around not doing it myself I jus fortunate that you didn't have a yeah ... yeah nobody should die from Hodgkin's ... if you listen to your body\nMy friend who is the is the state rep died in May of non Hodgkin's lymphoma fruit\n... spreads differently so it's tougher\nIt gets at ya it really does it takes its toll on everything by this kind of a downer conversation but the idea is to remind you to get your a mammogram ... and if you can yeah if you can get something more thorough if you can afford an MRI\nA lotta people say well we can't do any more because we don't have any\nMoney to pay for it but if you can I find MRI's are by far preferable and almost any circumstance to really getting to the root cause of whatever's going on inside of you so that's another angle and the third thing is don't give to the Susan G Komen Foundation\nAnd give to somebody else that are working on the problems of breast cancer\nAll right so that takes care of that television the ah last season\nOf orange is the new black\nOn Netflix is upon us why did that have that show have such impact I didn't ever watch it because I wasn't really interested in the in the line I have Netflix thanks to Ritchie getting me on to Netflix and when I was in the Amazon you sent me the Amazon\nAnd I think there's one other one right anyway um I never found orange is the new black some people are so excited about it and they think oh wow so\nIt was ... out there there are so many oh yeah programming so deep nowadays yes a hundred channels that you can watch all of these different shows and that's the way it's going to be our court programming and and some gravitate to this and some gravitate to that I think\nSome people like orange is the new black because there's not a lot of like completely female uh dramas on TV there's a lot of like reality shows or ... or how likely you don't get a lot\nOf actual acting with like mainly female lead so that kind of an exciting part of it hide rundown of\nThe
