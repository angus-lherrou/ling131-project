the country as your report said\nWorse than ever before um but when I actually go out of mind blue range into the red range of Americans I meet really decent beautiful people who and I listen to them and I can see\nSo much potential if people would just stop listening to this ratings the rating the horrors of of a mainstream news\nAnd just wouldn't talk to each other\nAnd they don't talk anymore John that's no problem nobody touch screen they argue but I've\nActually found the people in the red states more willing to talk than I Do the people around me who call themselves progressive\nAnd I live in the deep blue western Washington part of what Washington state and uh it's uh it's intriguing to me because of the thing that I did back in January of this year I I\nAnd uh it's uh it's intriguing to me because of the thing that I did back in January of this year I I put together a\nA this forecast which is the main essay at the end of ten predictions twenty eight team that you just mentioned and uh I was just reading it again after many months\nAnd I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put in is a that was basically is happening\nIs a a level of if you're gonna defined it in planets there's two major planets and astrology and political strategy either play right now one is a is you're honest and just recently come into tours\nAnd then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn Saturn [laughter] long story short it's a struggle you're honest finds itself in the ... sign which means it's dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations\nWhereas the the earth the sign of Capricorn Saturn is is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and so you have a long story short it's it it favors\nThe establishment more than it favors those who are resisting the establishment\nUm because Iran us into horses in its fall and it's in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in the least\nComfortable sign that it's transfer that you know last time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into ... or is it ... to ... major changes in political astrology it brought the German the third Reich into being under adult Hitler\nAnd it also uh\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt new deal to destabilize established a banking ideas and things that were restructured that in in a positive sense created a this this longest a\nProfitable wealth a period of the ... in history [noise]\nUh that happened because of the reforms of the banks those reforms have slowly been shipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms then Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same time demographics of the of the separation between the fuel all the and the\nMajority who have not so much wealth\nIs almost exactly where it was in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash\nAnd so we are repeating a cycle and uh so the the issue is there you're honest if ever I saw something that expresses itself in in Iran is in the fall the revolutionary the innovator the person with the original thinking\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to the current situation in the White House and and it is a it is expressing itself\nWith great passion and unpredictability button its negative it's about destroying from getting a house ...\nGetting sent back but for what it's not really defined itself\nIs what we know what the resistance is against I hear it all every day here because I live in the very heart of it you're a but but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if and if you follow this pattern\nWith much more energy to it than it happened before because I remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said no Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six\nI was on a show in Portland\nFive hundred thousand Oregonians watched it and the man who had a meltdown says you're absolutely crazy that can happen and of course four years later I said well no it will happen because if you're ... anybody but Bill Clinton\nYou're you're you're you're fundamentally a you don't have anything to replace him except you're on a tear him down and then and it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before\nAt least at least and and it's being I mean it's being the people of this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media news that it's really quite and\nThis classic um you're on us confusion and its fall and tourists you\nKnow where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud or sign [laughter] it's a muddy place a sloppy muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays similarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come\nAnd save you from yourselves and you know I have been a long long time first with art and then with the huge orange I've been\nTalking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it is\nReally a heron now it's um it's not going to be when I look at when I look at the situation on the sixth of November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where Iran is going retro grades it's back going backwards and in the sky which means that it's time to recollect where you've been and go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world [noise]\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving tourists around all just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day and starts backtracking into aries now what that means is that if\nIf red voters red American voters go to the polls early especially in other areas which will be in the early times\nOn hold on for a second John already at the break we'll come back and we'll talk more about this\nGrowing at ... dot com and download you

John ... with us as we talk about prophecy predictions John we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen productions how many have come true already\nWell uh there have been a number of the more of a shocking have been my my eighth prophecy what I did is is basically short a chapters that takes a theme and then looks at it fully and\nWant to give us some headlines of the ten real quick\nWell yes they they were the the definition of the year being the year of acceleration definitely things have intensified that way second prophecy was or you're honest in the last chance sect style that\nAt a play between Iran is in Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together and have more common ground but that petered out\nBy may ... and that seemed to happen in a way where there was also\nThe third prophecy will Trump be impeached or not in twenty eight team and it looks like that's definitely happening [noise]\nAh I've always said that both candidates and twenty sixteen were afflicted a astrological we both have the danger if not or if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means leave office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this but that they could leave in scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January [noise]\nSo uh it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before that the first half the day goes to the red states and the red voters they get out early they vote early\nAnd date is really going to probably be decided in a week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots\nBut there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house representatives\nWill ah see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon\nSo it'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west that uh might see at ... eleventh hour or close to the polls a turnaround so with that um you know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I Would simply say about President Trump that\nIf he survives this um these two years he will I still see has the potential to be a two term president\nUh what's what's so hard for the polarized people in my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other up just quietly watching this and\nTry and taking notes yeah taking [laughter] it's like you I mean literally is a large family members and other things are getting quite involved and passionate about it and I'm going well [noise] um every everybody watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in the fall and for us\nUh they're they're they're just watching the news and they're assuming that the other side is hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both sides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the the blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt white working class Democrats that really win voted for Trump because they've been neglected for few presidential cycles [noise]\nI Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until six fear if he's a two term president\nAccording to my interpretation of the astrology they're going to give them a chance when I talk to them and the red states I see it's very clear that they're not going to budge also the other thing that uh once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical vote I said\nIt's been much stronger minister\nI said ten months before Trump was a ... a elected I said the the big upset could happen through their um and so it's it's my sense is that\nThere will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving it's almost like it's it's a musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes to the Democrats the same number of feet\nAlmost like it's it's the musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes to the Democrats at the same number of seats just switching back and forth and in that there's not enough to create any significant legislative advance\nSo it's it's just more and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more\nThis functional than anything we've seen before\nIn is almost unbearable no\nWell it's I hate to say it to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not the end of this this this crisis that's going this evolutionary challenge and it's happening to the United states and the world\nIs just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually think of a way to get out of this margins it's going to have to get much worse and frankly it's Stalin Gees are saying that you're\nNot going to see a tide shift until the middle of the next decade we're we're we're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this prevail\nYet we're not even close it's going to get much worse and what's going to happen which kind of brings me to the issue of Kavanaugh and all the small fighting about that [noise]\nIs it I've said very clearly\nIn my back in August eleventh my articles than the Kavanaugh would be picked that um [noise] I I think people are stabbed pushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not saying they should be looking at according to their needs\nIf you look a cabin on the stars and what he's done his record I don't think there'll be weighed it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset by this Supreme\nCourt no I don't think so why a lot but\nI tell you these this time with the Iran is and Saturn the defining planets of next year and into twenty twenty\nThese these planets the way they're positioning the way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two major corporate establishment will to power\nThat you're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote a hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see this creeping coup d'etat of corporate uh hedging money which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's or sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great masses and sometimes violent citizen mass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened\nAnd so it's possible that after twenty twenty the American people or or the working people people started really starting to get riled about situation or there will be basically in a completely corporate elite control the United states\nAnd so that's that's my call I Hope I'm wrong I Wish I was more [laughter]\nRecently were on the History Channel really show called the last hope the Catholic Church of course has done under fire for all kinds of atrocities Lee ...\nHee huh it was um [noise]\nIt was a unique experience and and it's put me in a position that that show uh I mean to you have to kind of talk about something that happened the

[laughter]\nThe the thing is that the we are seeing him a moment coming in this century in the first half of the century where religions will see the other side of the prophecies the part the doors have been shut too and there's indications in prophecy\nIn Christian prophecy even that shows that once on the other side of this revelation will completely change the concept and leave behind even the identity of what was the Christian what it was to be Muslim what it wants to be Buddhist all of that will be left on this side of the door\nAnd what's on the other side is completely different

stop all in Germany and terrorize the people as one of the reasons why the Islamic\nThat's why they threw the shah eventually\nYes and so so this bad karma here and we're basically blindsided to our side or in this and we need to take a look at how we kind of gotten here comic ally\nNow so so we have a situation with Italy which really got me concerned in August where it's the last province where fifty thousand al ... affiliates who we've been supporting\nCity in Syria and\nWe're going to make their last stand against the Syrian Arab Army and the Russian air force and the Turks were also involved what happened in the eleventh hour just before it started\nStand against the Syrian Arab Army and the Russian air force and the Turks were also involved what happened in eleventh hour just before it started\nIs um ... organ of ... or ... the president of turkey and water and food and\nGot together and made a pact to not do the offensive to create a buffer zone a demilitarized zone and take the time to do something to help the people the three million people half of which are are are\nAre refugees all crowd that area owns horrible what what's good about that is it's it's an attempt not to have this thing happened I Know from my sources that there were a lot of uh the ... film the White Helmets who are basically al ... is a A R [noise]\nUh had already taken children and use them and some gassing attack that's the story I'm trying to track down\nAnd we're going to be broadcast as a ... started as a once again another false flag the Syrian regime have chemical weapon eyes them and that would have caused by you know we have thirty Russian warships as this time around\nAnd and the near equal number of American ships crowding eastern Mediterranean long story short we have a lot of military potential in a tight area\nIf a miscalculation happen it could get serious and and so and then one thing can lead to another in to a nuclear confrontation missiles of\nThe missiles of October in sixty two can become the missiles of October twenty Eighteen or twenty Nineteen\nUm the astrology kind of points to and some of the deadlines Nostradamus gave to along in a short deadline if if we kinda move up what may be the official start of the Cold War\nWhen the Russians announce ... achieved a parity in March first this year a delayed they're putting delayed his address to the nation Russia and any so he could see what was the military changes the rules of engagement was going to happen with the Americans [noise]\nHe I I actually quoted a lot of the speech and it shows it's very interesting look at how we've been in an arms race again with Russia because we pulled out of the ab a missile treaty\nAnd which was a seriously destabilizing move to unilaterally do it for a long story short they had to create a new system of of weapons that could be a deterrent to was surrounding Russia steadily with a anti ballistic missile batteries\nTo basically be able to shoot down their missiles so they couldn't defend themselves\nA very very destabilizing move a Harley report and\nSo the Russians declared in March first that pretty much we're in this Cold War and they have now made a parity you know interestingly enough fruit and drops ten billion dollars off the eighty billion dollar budget of the Russian defense\nThe same time Trump adds another thirty seven billion to something that's past seven hundred billion if you add the other sides to it were really spending one point one trillion dollars [noise]\nUh on defense spending in our military ironically it's half of what the US people produce monetary lead GDP every year which is exactly what happened\nAt the same time when the Soviet Union collapsed it was paying half of its money into its big military ah and it collapsed we're doing the same thing\nSo uh it's it reminds me of prophecies of ... and the spirit was channeled by stereo hunts and ... who is considered the Swedish Edgar Casey in the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd um because he channeled similarly and trance\nAnd he ... he would say things like that you'll see the one side of the Cold War over there and Russia have become more free in America would become more like the Soviet Union and least in this economic sense\nThat's true uh with more censorship that's happening to alternative voices you know the that's also a ... I Would say from my own experience with journalism that we're definitely looking more and more like the Soviet Union I grew up with the country I grew up with\nNo that's not true in in ... and the

celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and boy you sparked my interest John because it sounds like you had a very a similar situation what happened\nI did it's really a tale of two suicides a and both of us committed suicide the reason I Am speaking to you is because my experience with suicide was a spiritual\nSuicide rather than the usual what I call mundane suicide and most people encounter\nUm basically in the mundane suicide I contend\nThat you end up with your pain destroying the body mind that you're that you're mystery of Seoul is living in but in the suicide that happened to me rather than the one that I was indeed mundane league going to do [noise]\nI saw my misery and my pain commit suicide and I remained\nAnd so this is one of my most intimate autobiographical tales of a whole other dimensions of my life from\nAll these years I've never known this\nOh yeah I was I was I was walking through a golf course in San Pedro California I just come back from India and I was still in the ... opening kind of broke out of my shell of\nMany lives being with my my teacher in India for the first time and when it came back in the world the world that was not a place that supported this kind of individual flowering and I was having a very bad day\nAnd so I was walking down this beautiful beautiful a golf course adjacent to the trailer park but I Lived in\nA overlooking Santa Catalina island in San Pedro cliff and that's what I was walking it just dawned on me says I could just keep walking or beyond these cliffs and plummet down three hundred feet into the rock and I was going to do it because suddenly\nI had this amazing unexpected experience of life and death suddenly being very tangible unclear I have to see how they're\nReally one there really there are plenty of complementary or in our fear they're a play of terror and opposites but what was happening to me the feeling was that I Try to describe it but it's beyond words really beyond belief\nIndeed it was like um\nIt was descending on me faster than myself and I thought okay this is happening because I have made the decision to throw myself walk over this cliff if I turn away from this I'm going to lose this amazing experiences over taking me this mystery of life meeting death\nSo I saw this little eucalyptus tree and I sat up against and I said okay for for myself over I just wanted to feel this and take this with me over the edge\nAnd so I sat there just going inside and feeling it and it's some point I felt this electrical energy just rise above the ground through the roots of the tree and throw me forward face down into the crab grass or I just began sobbing sobbing and suddenly\nAll of that thank God all of that so that otherwise I wouldn't be killing ... no not at all and uh\nAnd and there was this moment after I cried it all out I turned and there was a little old eucalyptus trees and it was just shivering it sleeve and the Santa Ana wind and it was just this moment where ... sky the earth tree\nExistence love me existence he's everything that's created out of it as a phenomenal creation rising and falling as something absolutely integral significant\nAnd I had this feeling that so much of what society does to make us feel insignificant when you go in even at that moment of life meeting that insignificant becomes\nIn significant I it's so the story is really an ... it's a it's a jump from what I usually right about the whole other level of talking about these things that I haven't done since I did the ... is a book back in Nineteen Ninety nine sometimes my\nFull of talking about these things that I haven't done since I did the messiah is a book back in Nineteen Ninety nine sometimes my these books you see I I don't write these books they right they use me to write themselves and I had no idea until Anthony Bourdain died\nHow deeply he his his suicide how much he was loved and how many many people were shocked in the story I talk about the moment that inspired me to write this book I mean the cashiers line\nAnd there's this old lady and she's doing something that looks like she's never done before she's pulled actually a magazine out of the rack and looks at it and it's a people magazine a van seaboard Dane and I watched how she touched his cheek on the picture the way she did it was so\nIntimate and beautiful and that's when I realized yeah I Love him just as much and I think I think I understand what he was going through he was not a man to bullies\nOr in fairy tales and imaginary stuff and that Santa Claus is going to save him from his\n... and all that it's really pretty ...\nAnd and and and people like that when they die and I always feel there's a person that has the potential to become a an awakening one\nAnd I as I've been in my private life which I'm sharing more and more now in this period especially now when there's so much turmoil when there's so much\nUm Hanks and polarity my inner life now as a meditate or is now coming more and more into my work because it is still ... point this center of silence in peace in the cycle of life that's becoming stronger and stronger that\nIs what I can share with all of you as meditation the science of self observation\nIs is what what more and more I always thought my my work with evil more and more and it's still prophetic but it's going to have more of my own authority through my own experiences\nHuge let's take some calls here in the ... minutes we got left Thomas in Europe with John Home Tom\nHi George thank you for taking my call and John while [laughter] it's hard to follow your sharing of your experience on that but my question John yes\nFor a person to walk in the world to be a participant in the world\nHow can they develop their own centered ness so to speak such that they are not enough for dead on effect dead on touch my personal and planetary astrology\nWell\nWhat I can only suggests and I think only anyone who's honest and heart to heart with anybody is all I can suggest as my own experiences the meditation techniques that I've been using since Nineteen eighty\nAnd ah so my answer to that\nIs if any of\nYou listening to this resonate with what I've been saying [noise]\nEspecially with the issue of suicide and life meeting that\nUm I Am on a path where I can say there is a way to look beyond and not be touched you can be passionate and deeply into life but you're not overwhelmed jury you can be a Buddha and the marketplace but not of the marketplace of the world\nAnd that was what my teacher taught oh show and that is what I've live since Nineteen eighty since I went to India to see him for the first time and so with that said if you go to hope prophecy dot com and if you click on the contact", "year": "2018",
