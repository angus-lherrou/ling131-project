do\n\nAn early on early early on you had to get permission from the governors of these colonies most of whom were you know installed by the Brits to write something so they they started to do these pamphlets to get around all of that\nOne of the earliest printers not the earliest but one of them was\nBenjamin Franklin's brother and then later Benjamin Franklin\n\nThis whole idea of freedom of the press where do they come from\nIt came from them those white slave owners although Franklin ever owned slaves but you get the point\nThat's for freedom of the press came from freedom and the press

massive growing racial wealth gap let me ask you a question\nWhy do people risk their lives to come here\nBecause that sentence is telling you that America is racist and there's not equal opportunity in America that's what that senses telling\nWhy do people of color AKA non whites why are they flooding into America why are they leaving Guatemala and Honduras and Mexico in one country after another in central and South America\nWhy are they leaving one country after another on the African continent why they leaving one country after another in Southeast Asia\nEven China why are\nAll these people coming to the United states if there is a massive growing racial wealth gap there is no opportunity for non whites is that it\n\nOne of the problems we have in this country thanks to the left weather in the media or entertainment and elsewhere is a lack of promoting assimilation a lack of promoting assimilation learning English\nLearning American laws learning American practices and bracing American culture I mean after all you came to the United states to escape\nThat culture of your birthplace right isn't that what a refugee is isn't that what an illegal alien does otherwise white coming to America and America you see is so racist as a country\nThat as Iraq Obama and Joe Biden used to say by twenty forty four white people will be in the minority there so race obsessed\nWith America is so racist white Americans allow that\n\nBecause America as a country is not racist that's why\nPeople should be encouraged to embrace capitalism they should be encouraged to embrace entrepreneur ship they should be encouraged to embrace the private sector the profit motive\nCreativity productivity rather than government government government because\nThe vast majority of people do not succeed by getting a government check it destroys them it destroys initiative it destroys independent thinking it destroys the human spirit\nWhich is exactly why the left pushes so let's go back to this story\nAmerica has a massive growing racial wealth gap\nNow for the left of course that means more government more redistribution higher taxes more regular you know\nIn more and more and more to govern\nGoes on the median white family today holds nearly ten times the wealth of the median black family\n\nSenator Cory Booker is introducing a bill aimed at closing that gap that caught my attention his idea is to give lower income kids kids a\nNest egg nearly fifty thousand dollars in some cases that they could use for wealth building purchases like a down payment on a house\nA sizable nest egg nearly fifty thousand dollars in some cases that they could use for wealth building purchases like a down payment on a house or college tuition\nDid you hear this where are you familiar with this\nThese they call them opportunity accounts\nThey don't call these Marxist accounts they call them opportunity account what theoretically no this is the article this is the news article it doesn't say that it's an opinion piece\nThese opportunity accounts with theoretically make sure all children have significant assets when they enter adulthood rather than just those who grew up in wealthier home\nSounds cool right equality\nIt'll be a dramatic change in our country to have low income people break out of generational poverty bunkers set an interview with Fox we can rapidly bring security into those families lives and that is really exciting to me\nNow that will never be any discussion of where this money comes from never nobody cares\nWhat kind of taxes fought to be increased who cares what kind of additional debt will have to be accumulate who cares\nNone of it matters\nWhat talking about the quality of results economic equality we're not talking about liberty don't confuse us with liberty don't confuse that's what markets don't confuse us with opportunity no don't you see\nWe have a racist country we need to take money give it to\nPoor people poor kids up to fifty thousand dollars\nSo they can move into the middle class who say that simple\nWhy didn't I think of this why didn't anybody think these are opportunity accounts after all ladies and gentlemen were coming into the the modern era the modern modern era I guess economics don't matter that does it matter tax rates are irrelevant\nWe need an opportunity account of the fifty thousand dollars a kid what's the big deal at\nWall right it free college at ... at it free health care and while we're at it open borders\n\nAnd while we're at it why don't you destroy the country\nWhere the richest
