but online\nThey can actually build communities have hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people going into social media as you have this rise of these online hate groups I think it's extremely dangerous Senate dangerous and it it has given\nThem a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel\nWe monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here I Know that you're\nYou're a great defender of them are we don't have a First Amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your in laws and constitutional rights that Americans have to figure out a way to monitor this so they can see one sort of this kind of hate pops up\nAnd then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel um\nAnd it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other I think it's important for your forties to see what they can do to prevent\nThe next attack and uses armed guards and many of your singer\nYeah that's that's a reality that unfortunately juice face around the world if you go to London and the kind of God you are more likely than not to see actually a policeman\nA or a police car outside same thing in Paris same thing in Brussels and other places around the world that you don't want to see that happening in America I Do think that on high holidays well Shawn and you'll keep poured many synagogues you do have a local law enforcement authorities at least since nine eleven\nBut this was just choose going about their business praying\nAnd in a synagogue on a on a Saturday morning and to think that every single synagogue in America needs that type of protection protection is\nSad or but unfortunately at least for the foreseeable future it might it might be necessary not only to protect the population are but to give them a sense of security one thing that's important is for political leaders to speak out very very strongly against that I was very pleased to hear\nFrom President Trump I thought he had you know what the strongest combinations frankly I've ever heard I've never heard of non Israeli non Jewish leader say those who try to destroy the Jews we will destroy them I've never heard that mark from any leader\nAnd not only was it that that uh that was I heartened to hear the president of United States say that but I was heartened to hear the applause he got from the people who were at that rally in Illinois when he said that\nUh and it's important for people on the right to spit out the extremists among them to David Dukes it's important for people on the left to spit out the extremists like Louis Farrakhan and others and to say that there is no place for this type of hatred in the United states\nWell you know mainstream conservatives of never consider themselves for writer embrace David do we ... people like that but we do have a growing bbs movement in this country it's growing or college campuses quite frankly it's growing in the left and there's haters everywhere every breed of every stripe and so forth and so on\nBut in some ways it's getting more and more mainstream the the UN is rabidly anti Semitic the bbs movement which is in mainstream did many with many corporations and many organizations and political organizations in Europe and even somewhat in the United states\nThis again this is this is intended as an anti Semitic Jew anti Israel movement do you see this growing to\nNo question about it I mean for many years to the un has been ground zero France Semitism and holding Israel up to standard hope no other nation on earth when you have you know two thirds of the John we've simply tell is simply U.N General assembly resolutions against Israel\nThat's got to tell you something when you have more resolutions passed against Israel and the un human rights council that all the countries of the world combined\nUm that's got to tell you something and this is a deep problem people thought it was a thing of the past if not a it's a very serious and it's growing and that's why it's so important you know there there's a an old saying that you know it starts with the Jews but it never ends with the ... we have always been seen as the can area of the ... in the coal mine\nOf end of civilization so when you have those noxious fumes that are directed at dues\nUm it's not going to end there it's going to spread and that's why it's very important for people to frankly mark put all the politics aside\nAnd stand together whether you're on the right a conservative or liberal whether you're a Republican or Democrat and and say no to this kind of hate and and the lead by showing that this type of bigotry this type of hatred will have no sanctions and the United states of America\nYou know I agree completely putting politics aside but I've been watching this I'm sure you have in the United states our media and its politics first second and third it's politics morning noon and night it's politics trumped responsible for this is Trump this Trump this is Trump this\nAnd this killer this mass murder this ... Jew hater he hated Trump he didn't like Trump decided to many Jews around now you have in President Donald Trump may in my view the the greatest supporter of Israel many American presidents\nTrump decided to many Jews around now you have in President Donald Trump made my view the the greatest supporter of Israel but any American president\nHe's a knowledge that Jerusalem is the capital the president did that before he's moved our embassy to Jerusalem they all promised they never did it before he took this Iran deal which was passed by Congress\nAnd the prior administration which gave tens of billions of dollars to the terrorists regime which has the United states and Israel and its sights he said no more to that\nI mean from my perspective as an American as a conservative who's who's been watching this stuff for a long long time this president has been the best friend of the Jewish state certainly during my lifetime\n[noise] yeah I mean I I said this before or we've never had a strong supporter of Israel with President Trump a and frankly it hasn't even been close\nIn terms of what he's done I mean you look at some of those things that he's gone you have a Nikki Haley ambassador Haley at the un pushing back against all this anti Israel sentiment obviously the drove some [noise] and the case you are looking at us medical team in the planet they call for the annihilation of the one and only state that you have Hezbollah\nA proxy of Iraq that actually one of his both leaders that a few years ago that he hopes will come to Israel so we can wipe them out there\nFor the president of the United states put up to the entire world that were from the nuclear deal with Iran has storage bank tens and against Iran and\nIn doing so he is star of this anti Semitic terrorist regime of hundreds of billions of dollars that would be to to kill\nAnd promote a Israelis are and and also to putting all of our Arab neighbors and everything else one good thing that came out of that that nuclear deal for Israel and the Arab world closer together but we we appreciate very much in a very grateful for that support it like I said I'm very grateful\nOr that the president so forcefully\nA condemned or the anti Semitic attack I think it it is very very important I think people think it all of these things happened uh because of President Trump's election ... they're just getting themselves they don't understand\nThe history of anti Semitism is not only the world's longest hatred all this sacred to the most malleable hatred I mean ... or or\nHad been attacked and killed you know for being a capital for being a communist for being a the biggest dogs for being the biggest hawks are being called for being called you know ethnic separatists\nHaters can always find a reason to hate things and it's been going on for a long time and I hope one positive thing that can come out of this horrific act and people will stand together against anti Semitism ... President Trump is not the reason why you ever recorded\nIn Europe or the head of the British Labour Party and anti Semite it's not the reason why you have all these attacks have for many years and you're up against teams up fortunately this thing is\nHave come here to the United states and ... and is now eleven uh worshipers and scroll hill a Pittsburgh but if anything can come out of it hopefully people can stand together and put the politics aside understand that there are people who were anti Semite on all sides\nAnd people should stand together against this call out the anti Semite on our side of the political aisle that talk\nNot just calling it when it's on the other side but calling it on your ultimate whether it's David Duke whether it was fair con wherever cops
