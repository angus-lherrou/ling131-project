calling a\nCouple of lines open to be calling outline them up I'm gonna knocking down like pins and a bowling alley tonight eight seven seven three eight one three eight one one couple last thoughts before I turn things over to you\nThe pope Francis is walks in the shoes of the fishermen I'm a practicing Roman Catholic I Believe that he is a a he's a reflection of God himself despite all the ... and problems of the Roman Catholic Church of what you might have some\nBut it instead of me greatly this afternoon when I learned that Pope Francis has huddled with film director ... Michael Moore\nDuring his weekly general audience and the St Patrick's square now I don't know the pope who doesn't read current events doesn't read newspapers\nMaybe didn't know who Michael Moore was and Michael Moore simply worked his way to the front and huddled with the pope is if he was having a meeting with him Michael Moore is left wing radical extremist he's a a contributor Planned Parenthood that\nKills about three thousand developing babies every day\nHe's a ah certainly an individual that does not reflect American values hard work perseverance fear of God love of country so if the pope knowingly and wittingly met with Michael Moore I got a problem with that because especially as abortion feelings but nonetheless until I find out if the pope knew who he was\nIt's hard to criticize him and secondly and lastly big fight with a couple of weeks ago with Kevin ... is largely over but I did some statistical work\nWhat was one with a cabin all Brett Kavanaugh and what lies ahead the Supreme Court which I've not had the honor of appearing before takes about eighty cases a year\nAnd the nation's highest court decides another fifty cases without oral arguments general unanimously\nAnd they normally take cases where there's a conflict between the Thirteen circuits that is if the second circuit as a conflict with the sex or the night with the seven they'll take a case to resolve the conflict but just keeping your mind eighty cases a year and they take for oral arguments eighty cases each year\nBy contrast the U.S circuit court of appeals handled fifty one thousand eight hundred and thirty two cases in a twelve month period fifty one thousand eight hundred and thirty two compared to eighty\nSo if you throw on top of that the millions of cases and the ... district courts you're talking about maybe a million cases below the U.S Supreme Court and the Supreme Court handles eighty cases\nSo whether it's the hot button issues of immigration or gun control or or crime abortion whatever it might be\nThe the ... Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of those cases are decided at the circuit her district court level Ninety nine above nine nine nine nine percent so to break it down even further\nThirteen U.S Circuit court of appeals of the Thirteen eight or controlled by democratic appointed judges only four by Republican one district is split\nAnd so the most important one is the U.S court of appeals for the district of Columbia which is the one Brett Kavanaugh came off of the Democratic appointees there have a seven to three majority seven three one vacancies now available but that's going to be one of the three so it's going to say seven to three\nSo Ninety nine point nine nine percent of the federal cases\nAre resolved before the Supreme Court level\nAnd all of those about Seventy percent are controlled by democratically appointed judges so before you get to fired up about Brett Kavanaugh I Want you to hold those figures in your mind Supreme Court takes eighty cases U.S Circuit court of appeals handled fifty two thousand cases\nDistrict court about a million and so the great majority of the action is well below the U.S Supreme Court even with Brett Kevin all they're the only hope we have is normal God fearing Americans\nFor Trump to be an office another six years\nAnd if he stays in office six more years with the Republican Senate for all six years he may get as high as Fifteen Percent of those appointed by Republican judges so that is the mountain ahead of us don't get too high don't get too low\nSo what I'm saying is if Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the case it never gets U.S Supreme court\nAnd those that do generally dealing with the conflicts whether Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch are there or not it's certainly a great thing encourage more of it but it will take years and years of Republicans controlling the Senate and Trump controlling\nThe White House or parents after Trump to make any dent in the fact that about Seventy percent of the federal judges or appointed by Democrats and only about thirty percent bother Republicans and the reason is the last two or three years of Bush forty three Chuck Schumer refused to do anything in the Senate he shut down completely\nAnd should two weeks from Tuesday\nThe Democrats when the U.S Senate which appears to be a pill at this point but should that happen he's going to shut down again and they won't be any appointments for the last two years\nOf Trump's first term in office I said first term\nFun becomes available away a few lines open to be calling out hey seven seven three one two three

arranged a kitten that doesn't guy though and if you look at um John Brennan last past two days and they said\nHe confirmed that bill hits the operative so I think\nUm yeah we are complex and even though we didn't have involvement in the murder and we did not warn him and that's what a big issue in the final point\nOn on on that point do you believe al Jazeera any more than you believe CBS why why\nWhy do you rely on al Jazeera which is an arm of the extreme Muslim Palestinian Authority why do you believe algae zero out a cutter why do you believe them I wouldn't believe one word they

don't\nKnow how some against them because they're they're grown [laughter] when you cannot get what you see what your own eyes and a lot of points\nSo you know hold on Cape assuming things happen and and I certainly except they're true is not not nearly as bad as a few hundred Americans killed every year by illegal aliens how come we're focusing on that awful murder and not what's happening inside of our own country\nBecause we're focusing on it because President Trump I voted for planet down he's trying to change the narrative\nCars\nGoing that way and I'm just glad that part's Jeff came out that the Saudis five hundred dollars worth of weapons that they know\nThat that's great that put a lot of people to work in a cave there's ten\nThousand Americans killed every year instead of America do care about any of them let's investigate cage timely let's investigate about seven hundred murders in the south side of Chicago not so how's it going to invest in those murders but they don't fit the political diatribe against Trump right\nNow I'm told that that's the corruption out of it when it when they get some but not just like some officers are just got killed about an hour ago and Kurdish hiking I when I got an e you ask me if I'm top one percent on your side we just need to get\nMuch of that today that have come a murder of Assad citizen in Turkey it's such a big deal here why\nBecause way man come quicker\nThan not complicit were not complicit with crap we're\nNot complicit with anything come on man come on we're not\nYou you are you one of those characters whatever bad\nHappens in the world America's complicit what does that mean complacent what does that mean how stupid it was it for the sides to kill them in that fashion almost on videotape that was stupid\nThat was real stupid and I hope we're not stupid but even if\nIt happened the way we think it happened frankly my dear I don't give a damn compared to what's happening in this country every year\nHow many cops are killed two hundred concert murdered every year in this country that CNN go into the murder of police officers and why that's a horrible thing how can CNN will not cover the murder cops but they're covering some side citizen in Turkey why\nI totally agree with you just like we have three hundred and Seventy five thousand horses every year I talk to Tom Ridge\nNo big deal but they're just using this as a cudgel to be trumping the head with his if we care and I don't care compared to the murder of cops\nThe murder of the innocence ten thousand murders cage timely hundreds of Americans killed by illegal aliens rapes in robberies how 'bout investigating those things that make sense\nIt makes her nobody wants to investigate homicide has gone up innocent children and this week for us made weapons so complex that\nYou you mean in Yemen\nBucks just got killed this guy and you know as weapons with Saudi Arabia soak\nIn my way to many teeth are you saying we're complicit in that too because we sold a weapon if somebody is Smith in West been complicit in one of their weapons kill somebody\nThey know they're coming under\nFire bombing of course country in the

out of here thanks for your call hope the Dodgers lose this afternoon on let's continue as more we're going to go to Chris in Atlanta Georgia Chris in Atlanta Welcome to the markets have been shown Chris please go ahead Chris how are you I'm doing well are you a great day to be an American please go ahead\nAmen to that so it's just a quick question you mentioned earlier about um [noise] I don't I Can't bear phrase what you said about the specifically about him man of Christ will have a ...\nHow about if you have a problem with that meeting with like hell yeah\nOkay well I mean I just I mean I'm just going out of the issue with it but um if if we believe I'm Catholic so I Believe in the right price when when um [noise]\nWhat what is your what is your what\nDo I agree with that to Christ but the difficulty I don't think Michael Moore went there to get the pope on video\nTalking to him as if he was a center wanting to be confessing to and receiving grades from the pope I think Michael Moore went there as a student to capture the pope\nIn a moment that he could use for his own political purposes against Trump and if Michael Moore is that some catharsis like Paul and the road do a Damascus\nAnd said okay I've seen the era my waves I've seen the damage that cause the police officers in American Soldiers I see the damages caused by three thousand innocent babies killed every day in this country and I'm going to the pope for forgiveness for what I've done um with it\nBut I think Michael Moore probably went there with the pope today in order to get a photo opt to use politically against him that's what I think\nI I I agree with you know just like you're not feel that I'm already knows you Michael Moore is maybe [laughter] personally [laughter] background\nWell you know Chris a pope is giving interviews in which he says he does not read newspapers is not watch television and it came from Argentina now in Rome\nAnd we'd like to think in America where the only country that matters but I guess if you spend your life in Argentina Brazil and Central America South America now you live in Rome you probably don't read newspapers or watch TV how how would you know Michael Morris and so I you know I guess I could work my way to the front of the line and get a picture with the pope\nBut I Would like to thank Michael Moore is not one of those characters and pope would be familiar with and if he was I Would hope Michael Moore was able to convince the confessions medicines\nSure I\nI think about people maybe give him credit for um just 'cause I I there there's a little bit about him that strikes me as\nA you know I like to be supportive there's there are there are a lot of things that really strikes me about him and to me it's not it's not surprising when when\nThe weather is\nFairly harsh sent love question he's he's not the last pope now he's not Benedict each Francis\nAnd he's a socialist he's left wing or and or in this whole uh precisely scandal or something that die hope is not up to his eyeballs in it from uh South America and I hope he's clean but what he did with McCarron when he did was world didn't excite me too much and um\nAnd I I just hope there is no there there what Chris we gotta go thanks for your call let's continue now costs from Texas Virginia New York coming up and about forty five minutes\nI spent some time with the
