nineties yeah and uh you know and I have clients uh we're in the eighties and you know we all sit down and talk and they go well gosh you know we never thought we were going to live this long\nBut then you know they also feel that we didn't think we were going to feel this young either you know so\nAnd that's kind of a great thing because I guess the sixties is a new forties [laughter] since the eighties is in the sixties though you know with modern medicine a and\nPeople more aware and more active you know they're living a lot longer range more active so\nThey are more active I think I've told you this before my eighty five year olds grandma wears a sick day and she still lives at all no way we'll take classes like art classes drives yourself around and I think it tells you this

right you know oh you're eighty five you're just a child very right exactly and I said I said\nIt's so great but because of how long people are living and because of how long retirement can last I mean if if you are living into your nineties or age one hundred ... ... you're not working a part time job more than likely [laughter] at that age you need to be prepared for this financially and\nFor so many people because retirement last so long it unfolds in stages where we have those earlier years where we are more active\nWe have those years toward the middle in the end where we start to slow down a little bit and then the final phase of retirement and each one has some different things to prepare for your arm is why do you think it's important to break down retirement into these different stages\nYou know I've always said [noise] you how to read an elephant and it's a bite at a time 'cause now times people get overwhelmed\nOr when they look at the bigger picture and they go oh my gosh

and founder of Laura financial grilled\nMeat surf families across northern Arizona you can find him on line at vora financial dot com that's Laura V. as in Victor Oh our a financial dot com and damaged important event for you to have realistic expectations for income in retirement\nOh it's paramount because you know with the one of the things we always run into that you know I was asked people have said you know you're making say I'm just going to use an example so that so you're making fifty thousand a year and if you're going to retire your incomes going got going to drop down to thirty\nAnd you know what is your life so I looked like I mean do you still need the fifty thousand in a lot of times people say you know what thirty thousand I ... I think I can live with it and you know usually when people say I think I can live with it ah I actually it concerns me and the reason being is\nYou know when I Do my personal finances and I I really think I'm not a spender and then I realize the amount of money that I'm spending on things necessity and it's a lot higher because when you eyeball something versus\nAnd then I realize the amount of money that I'm spending on things necessity\nAnd it's a lot higher because we knew eyeballs something versus you really do the math or two different things and so we actually tell people that they should consider doing a test run if you're planning on retiring\nI Would say and if you said you could live on thirty thousand a year so let's plan that it let's do a six month test run because what that's going to allow you to do is tightened some of the screws on the engine right to make sure that if if there are certain things that we can adjust where you can live on thirty thousand a year that's one thing\nI'm In some cases you know people have to tap into their retirement account and what is the realistic expectation that you're how much your money should be earning\nA their financial advisors they you know have recommended ... you know estimated that you should be earning seven to nine percent\nI personally think that's a very high number and because what happens is when you are getting to the preservation stage your your have your money's going to work is also going to change because I always tell people that said you know when you're in retirement and if you're investing like you're twenty eight years old or thirty five years old\nAnd you're taking that kind of risk and most people don't even understand that that that that they're taking that kind of risk\nAll they're looking at is while I'm making all this money but they don't understand when the pendulum swings the other way what kind of you know I've always said you know pendulum swings both raise writes if you just visualize a pendulum when it goes up it's pretty because you're making tons of money and you're happy you're returns are great for you is growing and all that\nWhen it goes the other way it could actually turn into a wrecking ball oh gosh yeah you do right into your portfolio our job is to help her clients sidestep that by minimizing in understanding what the risk is and in retirement if you made less money\nBut you get to keep your money that's a good thing you know you know this is not the time to get rich this is the time\nTo protect and preserve and make sure that your\nWithdrawal rate what you're trying to take out of that I count is realistic uh also to the growth you were having because you want to make sure that your child in a new growth rate aware if if you're making not enough\nThat and you're taking money out they could start invading your principal and that's what we're trying to avoid\nAnd you know we've always talked to her clients and said listen if you start with or start out with a number and based on your withdrawal strategy\nIf you can hold that number steady over your lifetime I think you're in a great place but when you start cutting into it you know that starts depleting fairly quickly and you'll run out of money before you know it\nAnd I talked to a lot of people that are very concerned about the Social Security not being there and I don't have the answer for that I'd like to tell people it will be there because so many Americans depend on it\nBut we don't know what the future holds and we don't know who's going to be in the office and how the Congress looks at it and what our debt looks like and uh you know we've already and Chileans in Chile in ... at a country\nAnd um you know these are the kind of thing so you you want to really be self sustaining rather than having to depend on other people for income\nI've had I've had people with pension plans um they've come in and they moved to Flagstaff and you know we were looking at their pension and it was about six months ago you know they came in at one of my prospective clients came in\nAnd he said I just received this letter for my pension company which is that they are going under\nI don't know and so there's a what's called a pension guarantee fund but uh you don't get a hundred percent replacement so\nBecause they are going under they ended up receiving a significant less amount of money so you know these are the things I'm not saying this is a scary it's an awareness thing and people should be aware because you know used to get ahead in the sand it doesn't mean the problem is going to go away you know\n... we're talking today with Josh why he's the owner and founder of for a financial group if you have questions about some of the things we've been talking about maybe you are concerned that you don't know what the backup plan is if you happen to get notification that some of your income in retirement isn't going to be there as we were just talking about\nNine to eighty six eighty two fifty five\nAnd nine to eight cue to six eight to five five or nine to eight to ... talk to reach ... team at for a financial group\nGarnish how do you have somebody planned for some sort of a shortage in income or some sort of gas White's death inheritance isn't going to come through this pension isn't going to be what you thought it was how do we plan for all those big unknowns\nLike is the first thing so let's assume if I'm sitting down with you and your husband and we're sitting down and talking first um I Would let's say you're in pre retirement stage and you're not there yet but if you're in pre retirement stage a that is the time I highly recommend I mean people should have a financial advisor period\nAnd a good financial advisors going to help you through your accumulation to the preservation to the distribution phase and you do you maintain that relationship\nBut if you and I were sitting down with your husband we would be talking about what does your pension looked like if you had a pension what does that look like because a lot of people don't know\nWhich option to choose in retirement for pension benefits or I run into people that had made decisions on their own there so this is the highest pension benefits and what ended up happening was the elected the wrong pension benefit meaning\nThat they are the only person that was going to receive it and you know unfortunately you know if that person died\nThe surviving spouse gets nothing oh no oh God and you know and if people have done that or they picked an option where the surviving spouse gets about sixty percent of what they were getting\nIn the problem with that is the surviving spouses still going to need income mhm and you know then that is a really poor place to leave someone that you love if you don't love 'em then pick the first one you know [laughter] I'll just get a job [laughter]\nBut you know everybody that he is married and in cares about their family they want to make sure that the surviving person goes that surviving person has adequate income of course I'm also with Social Security benefits you know when do you take it and\nYou know what is the best way to get Social Security benefit because one of the things that we also run into is that when people are electing Social Security options you which is the right one and two we actually use software and reduce implanted with our clients show which is the best option for them\nAnd I want to take a step back and just say the reason or show is called the retirement roadmap show is because we plan you know this is retirement to us is a journey\nThat journey that you've never been on before so there's a lot of small moving parts that most people don't realize that we kind of take that into consideration I mean twenty seven years in this industry I mean we've read all we've seen it all we've done at all and so we kind of help put the pieces of things that people don't even think about\nInto play and show them what that's going to do for them how to take the best option their pension how to select the proper Social Security benefits because people don't know should I take it as sixty to do to get at sixty seven to eight to Seventy\nMasks they say when the auction mass drops you know they want you to put on their ashes mass first and then the children are another passenger\nWhich feels counter intuitive you want to help your kids but you can't help them if your incapacitated\nCorrect and so part of the planning a is understanding where are you money's going in once you understand where that is going\nAh it makes life a lot easier so you're not just him poll simply going out and spending money on something that you need but you can plan for those things and it doesn't take that long for me to sit down and help you do that but it's important that regardless\nYou use me do it yourself or get a program on line whatever it is but having a plan to understand exactly what your money's going to be it that's going to be extremely important because that's going to lead you into your retirement spending is going to look like and what's funny and what's not fun\nRight right it can get started on this retirement roadmap west ... and the team that more financial group nine to age ... cheese steaks eighty two fifty five is the number for your call again nine to eight cutest chick eighty two fifty five or nine to ... to ... talk\n... let's talk a little bit about how we can manage risk heading into retirement so many people are so concerned about volatility and what could happen next in the markets how do we manage that risk\nYou know it's very carefully [laughter] getting there is actually you know the retirement roadmap plan by the way we didn't talk about a bill collector that you'll have an retirement which is the IRS\nOh yeah they're ...\nThey're going to want their peace and if you're inefficient\nYou going to pay the highest tax dollars the highest amount in taxes and you know working with a professional that can actually help what we do we help our clients create an income planted retirement understand\nWhat their tax pictures going to look like now one thing we did talk about is that two of the largest assets when my clients have is their home in their retirement accounts\nThis money in retirement account has never ever ever been taxed before that when you take a penny out of that account it's taxable Mm maybe taking more out of it is going to be more taxable\nBut here's the other kicker about the debt collector the IRS not only is going to tax that portion of your money but depending on what your income is in retirement\nUp to eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits could become taxable and originally when FDR\nPlanned this you know signed the bill for Social Security\nYour Social Security benefit was supposed to be one hundred percent tax free not anymore not anymore you know so so those are that that's one aspect of of you know that's a big part you know that's a big bill collector that's worse than having a mortgage but then we talked about risk management right\nSo when I Do a retirement roadmap plan for the people that I'm working with right\nWhat I'm doing is I'm really identifying how much money they need to earn as a minimum\nIn order for them not to run out of money in retirement take into consideration inflation taking into consideration there Medicare part B payments\nPart B and supplements and all that uh taxes they may have life insurance they have long term care and all that stuff so we're planning for those things and you know one here's one thing I find\nThere's so many people that I come across do not have life insurance or any kind of long term care benefit in retirement so you know realistically if you don't have any of this and people that are healthy\nDon't think about those things unless they have personal experience with their family member but that's a significant amount of potential hit that your portfolio may end up taking we're going to talk about that\nA little bit later on but here's what I Do\nWe're trying to create some risk free strategy against the risk versus risk free meaning that part of the portfolio we want to make sure\nIsn't impacted negatively should we have another correction because we've been in a significant bull market since oh seven or eight ... and you know we're you know people I talk to their all nervous because you know there's something bound to happen\nAnd is the short term volatility where you have a twenty thirty forty percent correction in the market and the reason I called a short term is because you know it's it's about six months you know you know the markets have lost fifty percent of its value in the past\nAnd it's taken six seven years to get it back so the short term volatility has a long term impact on people's portfolio and if you aren't paying attention to that that is what's going to make another way you're going to run out of money in retirement\nIf you're concerned about your current situation and would like someone to sit down with you and most likely it's going to beat me so call my office it's nine to eight two to six\nEight to five five it's nine to a two to six talk or you can reach us on our website which is ... and Victor or a financial dot

costs and long term care we can't afford to let that just wipe out when we get in retirement\nAnd you know the funny thing is just joking around and that I told somebody has said you know I Know that you know most people that I talked to they've just kind of lived life you know the nutrition and balancing of carbs against your protein and all that that I Am new to all of us right it's like I Can't

tend to do a lot more\nAh rewarding ourselves for things by spending money on things or you know like buying things and so forth but here's one thing that comes into play when you retire and we talked about the taxes we talked about income we talked a little bit about how to manage risk\nAnd how to make part of your money a risk free and some will have risked so you're tapering down your risk\nYour golden retirement is to preserve right preserve what you have to maintain a good lifestyle and make sure this money last you and your spouse\nBoth lifestyles and at the end I Hope that there is some

Security you have potentially a pension yet employers they're generous enough to you know I have four one K. plant where they did matching and so forth\nYou know small employers don't have that
