forward to making a positive difference and helping folks out\nIn the region store joined the firm is because he does have quite a financial background and you know I've had stored number of years ago

Flagstaff downtown Flagstaff\nAs well as we have an office in Sedona that services or the tri city area which is you know the ... camp Verde\nArea a clock do and so forth right low growth out there in in great opportunity to help you more book\nWell I'm Glad to have you in Studio as well Stewart and I know it's it's Kennedy herding cats game with stuff have you back well the where\nI was just kinda on earth today [laughter] actually we're here you're the roads between two story [laughter] we got a buddy of coffee you know that's why we're ready to you know I dabble\nI got my work cut out for me that you know one of the things we're going to focus on today that we were chatting about a little bit off line\nIs financial wellness and how much having a healthy mind and body really goes hand in hand having healthy finances that you know what most of us know what to expect when we go in for a check up on our physical health\nBut we don't know what to expect for a financial check out so that's where I'd like to be getting today garnish how do we get\nStarted with that well you know me being a doctor on radio so I think I guess I can talk about financial help\n[laughter] so\nI've always talked to people about a financial checkup is extremely important and you know you have to have just like you would go get your you know oil changed on every three thousand miles and it's funny in our industry is that the\nYou know there's a saying in our industry that guys take better care of their vehicles and take care of their health you know and in women live longer because they take better care of their health and so that's kind of important aspect of what we're doing here and one of the things we found was that\nLike you're supposed to do a physical every year with a doctor in and get a check up and so for doing that on your finances extremely important as well because you know a lot of times you don't realize there is a problem and you know you're too far down the road\nAnd you know if there's any kind of corrections or strategy change that has to happen we want to be able to implement and make those changes as soon as necessary\nWe're talking today with ... owner and founder of our financial group and see where it makes the annual here this is well he's part of the team that for a financial and I'm generally jak alongside his retirement ... powered by for a financial group\nIs that when you get in your car and you start driving\nAnd the first stop you would say would be you know like going if you're an ice forty you'll be going towards Williams so first off will be Williams then it'd be so women then you'd be Kingman\nSo theoretically when you're looking at this you're not getting to check your tires and things like that until you get to a gas station right and if you need gas that's what you're doing\nBut what happens is if there's a problem in between that distance you're absolutely unaware of four fifty sixty ... even a hundred miles versus what happens in retirement planning\nIs that a lot of times people say you don't you know check a couple of years or you know most of the most of what we've seen is that people have come in and they said you know I had a financial plan done ten years ago mhm and I go and then what and they go ... we've\nRun out of ten years ago and I think we're on track I I don't know I I go how can you be so sure or are you sure and most people I sit down with they really don't know if they're on track or not they just goes you know life is happening\nAnd we have an advisor that's kind of managing our accounts and I think we should be good\nWhen most people don't realize is when I first started in this industry back in the early nineties the rate of return or projections that were being used were significantly higher\nThan what we consider using today and I was speaking to another financial advisor in our community\nAnd realize that they're using a pretty robust rate of return in projections on their portfolio so you know it always looks like you're going to make so much more money and then you create your spending plan around how much money you think you're going to have\nAn intern you're good to have a significant shortfall because he didn't perform up to that level\nAnd so part of this also is we won't talk about risk management\nYou know if you look back you know this year will use this year as an example I I don't want to go very dated on the timing but if you just look back this year we've had significant volatility in the market and the recent months uh we've had quite a bit and I think\nPeople don't realize if the markets are up or down because you know sometimes they turn on the TV and it says\nYou know the S. and P. hits new ... Jones industrial average has hit new high\nAnd they think that they're making all this money but then they don't realize that too after that the Dow Jones industrial as guns out of a five hundred points or something like that you don't\nOr maybe several thousand points in like in that case so those are the kinds of things\n... gone data about five hundred points or something like that you know\nOr maybe several thousand points in like in that case so those are the kinds of things that you know when we create a plan that's where we're at dress we're really addressing the safety component of your plan so here's the thing if you're going to Los Angeles and here\nAnd the road map you know your Google Drive or whatever you you have any more\nWhat do you call them nowadays wherever the navigation system navigation ... ... you know I I still go back and think about you know like I was thinking about the Rand McNally road atlas writes most of us travel ban on the day before all this stuff came out\nYou know we have to we actually had to lay it out and make a plan and really understand that you know if you drove respectable speed limit and you know read considering traffic and so forth that you would get to your destination in a certain period of time and\nThat's where people are really losing the focus is that you know too much electronics is in the way too much garbage is going in their heads from watching TV and so forth\nAnd everybody's chasing returns what I mean by that is that you know people are looking to make as much money as possible but they don't realize what the downside stroke up that would\nBe right and if you just kind of go back and look at\nWhat happened to two thousand seven two thousand eight short here in Tucson at that time 'cause I was younger than you saw your big cities even worse\nOr absolutely seeing folks there were a hundred percent tied into real estate because at the time you know the real estate market with a booming in the early to thousands meant and things were great until it wasn't and people lost half of\nTheir their value overnight they couldn't give it away correct right I mean we just saw people were unprepared and and they didn't have that they didn't realize that things aren't going to keep going the same way whether it's up or down and to not panic and then up the whole holistic approach\nBut it also provides opportunities as well you know how to\nWrite so you know I mean you know when we look at the market so we're seeing you know we have big upswing in the market\nAnd then you see big down swinging the market right and then we see panic and\nWe see we get to see all kinds of emotions right you know greed fear panic all that stuff right anger and you know we we find is that when people don't have a plan\nThe emotions get the best of\nRight and and bad things you know we we all go through difficulty throughout the day right that doesn't mean the ruined our day\nAnd then that's the whole thing that we have a plan to move forward whatever it might be as we're going on a vacation going on a trip whatever it is a we have a plan to move forward and that and that's how we approach or the financial plans as well and how important that is because without that plan that's when the panic something that\nWe've had a bull market for probably a decade at this point right and\nIt's been well you know like I mean if you look at the ten years the markets made up but you know the volatility that's have come into play has been pretty significant in two thousand eleven you know if you're just at home and one for giggles if you look at the Dow chart in two thousand eleven\nAnd you go back to look at two thousand two thousand eight charge\nIt was an exact mimic the market has been the charts where exactly mimicking that instead of going down\nWhat happened was the federal government stepped in and then they get infused much money in the market right and that's what kind of ... the mark it up and it's gone up since the end you know in the long term we see the markets will go up by the fact is that\nIf there was a major market correction and you know you are retired and you're reliving\nOff this money and you're taking out say a thousand a couple of thousand maybe three ... three thousand dollars a month out of that account\nAnd your portfolio overnight just got chopped in half because the markets went down right and you're just you don't think it's a short term volatility and usually you know in in oh seven or eight when the market corrected\nThat was it all happened within six months and that was considered a short term volatility but it was a major market correction and if you know anyone that's retired I'm In their retirement no seven away\nAnd if you're thinking about retirement and you're not really thinking about rescue should have a conversation with one of these folks that were affected by this and you probably know them and\nWhat happened there was if they were taking money out out of their investment accounts for the IRA count as it's chopped in half because markets went down\nAnd they took him seven years to get back to where they were but if you're drawing against it\nYou will never recovered that money and there's a great chance that you will run out of money a lot sooner and bluntly speaking I read this wrecking ball\nWe always talk about pendulum you know when the market's going one way it's beautiful you know everybody's smiling and laughing\nAnd will swing vent pendulum swings the other way [laughter] it's a wrecking ball you know what to do a portfolio and you know like Stewart was a part of the of mortgage company and you know what was your title and more movies banker or else the mortgage banker first magazine the financial and yeah\nThe company went out of business right behind it and that happened to a lot of folks I mean companies that were highly leveraged didn't up again plan a for for a long term\nIssues and and that's what happened with them and you know and the thing is that most people\nHave to have a significant um analysis that should as the analysis done to understand what kind of risk they can actually afford to take right and you know we we do run into a lot of people that say well you know I have bombs from my portfolio that safe\nI don't know how to answer this question but I always say you don't want you to call people that own the LA county bonds rents would muscle there went bankrupt right or how about your choice\nRight and you know I mean you can go down the line and you know they're in depending on what\nKind of bond you're buying but you know I mean there's still a significant risk associated with it the other thing we also look at uh when we talked about the risks portion of it is that uh the fed has been talking about they're going to raise the interest rate\nAnd what happens in bonds that most people don't think about they think most people are taught wrong but they are taught that stock market and the bond market work against each other meaning that the stocks are off the bombs are going to be down and bonds are up the stocks are going to be down well that is not true\nWhat effects the bond market is the interest rate in the interest rate is going up the bonds are going to go down in value and if you know if the interest rate goes down the bombs go up in value is if you just mentally see a seesaw\nAnd if you put bombs on one side and you put the interest rate on the other side and if one thing goes up the isn't going to go down so you just keep that in mind so you know we always talked about creating safe strategies in retirement so if you're listening to the show and I actually have a gift for you\nAnd they have the right kind of product or to help balance out the risk against the safety the idea nudey would be the safe component that is correct but a lot of times what the advisors are doing is that they have their clients' money in the market\nAnd they sold client a annuity variable annuity just to generate additional revenues for their for their company\nAnd it's a it's a revenue approach it wasn't a holistic approach to planning\nAnd so that's one side of it right so let's talk about the the kind of a new disease that we feel good about can we light and those are called fixed\nAnnuities right no fixed or nudity is not going to make you rich if you think you're buying a fixed annuity because you're going to end up with doubling your money five years it ain't happening\nRight now I'm looking at a guaranteed right of return and how right that is right in in the idea behind that was really is to you know the new to the ... are designed not to make you rich but it's actually design\nFrom keeping you from becoming poor right and so within a fixed annuity a family\nThey have one called indexed\nSo it's got fixed indexed annuity and the fix component means that your principal is not going to go down\nAnd index so everybody's heard about index funds would index funds to his mimic the stock market the U.S and the five hundred the Dow Jones industrial average or you could ever NASDAQ you get a Russell one thousand two thousand three thousand I mean she should have gone right right there's a whole list of things you could index and so forth\nSo these annuities actually have where you rate of return on your fix nudity\nIs linked\nTo the performance of an index and you're not going to make as much money as the index and you'll never make as much money as the index but what happens is that when indices go down\nYour money doesn't go down so if you take say I'm just using it as an example we had a hundred thousand dollars in let's say you make five thousand dollars in interest on that now that hundred and five thousand dollars with the fixed annuity\nBecomes part of your principal meaning it's locked in it doesn't ever go backwards stock market goes down fifty percent guess what you get a big fat zero for returns\nAnd still at the one oh five now still want to fight right in the markets come up that one of five will go up to whatever the next you know growth numbers for any luck itself but you know the thing is that you give up some of the upside gain\nTo have what's very important which is downside protection because the bombs don't do that the stocks don't do that the mutual funds to undo that exchange traded funds to undo it and the variable annuities don't do that\nThe real life you know the actual value of your portfolio will go down and most of this all almost all of those products\nExcept for the fixed annuity nuts peace of mind offering protection of your nest egg right and so if you just joined us you know we just talked about variable annuities and we do what's called a new day now says so if you own annuities and you have questions about\nFees and concerns and interests that you might be taking with that give us a call and also we have a gift if you're listening to the show\nAnd I have a book or I have about ten or ... and the authors Patrick Kelly\nAnd his book is called stress free retirement it's absolutely free gifts to call and we'd be happy to send will now to you our number is nine to eight two to six eight to five five it's nine to a two to six talk\nAnd so we didn't talk about risk management and how to figure out how much exposure to the adverse market condition that you know an individual should be taking\nWell let's go ahead and take our break now than garnish and we will pick up on the other side we talk a little bit about risk management and Jeff how they have something that's going to be unique to everyone just how much rent than they should be taking with

side or I think owner and founder of more than ...\nAlso here with us today Stewart Danielle is part of the team at for a financial you can learn more about them at Boris financial dot com that for the next year oh our a financial dot com or the number to call you have questions of that kind of things even talking about today nine\nTo eight inches thick eighty two fifty five that's Ninety rate sex talk\nAnd they tell me a little bit of that risk management how do we know if we have the right amount of risk\nSo for starters you know when we talk about his rule one hundred so some people have heard it and you know we've talked about this on the show in the past\nBut if you took one hundred and if you subtract your age from that\nSo assuming that let's say somebody sixty years of age rights or you subtract sixty from one hundred answers\nForty and what that means is a forty\nPercent of your investment portfolios should be associated with risk and sixty percent of your money should be somewhere safe and yeah we talked earlier\nThat you know people have the false sense of security when they own bonds or you know even they own variable annuities that have income riders and things of that nature and those things I consider those false sense of security\nBecause we're looking for is what is your real dollar worth not an income writer but real dollar and send this case where we talked about is if you were to take sixty percent of your uh investment or you know sixty percent of your account value and that should be somewhere safe\nAnd you know you could put that in CDs money market accounts but what do they pay today do you know\nNow that is well almost nothing nothing right it almost ... so what happens there is that if it even if ... percent doesn't matter but the thing is that you're going broke\nVery safely and you don't realize that you're going broke right because\nYour money's not keeping up with inflation so you need your money working to or at least keeps up with inflation that means you're seeing even Stephen but we're we're focusing on is actually growing it a little bit more than that so that you always have the growth factor associated with it\nEspecially as your expenses go up you'd actually be you better than inflation right correct because as your expense to go up your best hope cough because for\nMost people don't realize but their pension you know people were thinking that far ahead but they you know oh they're so worried about retiring and having enough money when they retire\nThey don't realize that the cost of living adjustments like you were you when you were working and you got to two percent pay increase or or three or four whatever\nOr some of the some of you listening gold mine for hasn't given me a raise in five years you know because I mean there are some people that just you know aren't structured that way but most most times when people are working their cost of living adjustment as a as their income goes up every single year\nBut what happens in this case is that most pensions\nDo not have it cost of living adjustments so today you know the middle of like we talked about in the past were laughing about um you're on the show but we had talked about you are when I first started driving you know gas prices were like eighty nine cents a gallon and\nI remember that you do write up under a hundred dollars and her daughter right and so by the time I actually graduated\nHigh school or the prices have actually gone up over like Donald Thirteen or so\nAnd you don't you know what I mean today if you look at it it's you know whatever the price I Love to have a kind of gas prices again right [laughter] yeah that'd be fun [laughter] but that was inflation right and today I just just ordinary were just talking to a client of ours\nAnd they ended up buying a new vehicle and I asked him I said would you pay for the vehicle and and they told me the number and I do realize that your parents first house\nWill cost less than what you pay for your vehicle today right and they're like that is so true you know that is so true and so you know we're looking for understanding how the inflation is going to impact\nShelling you some of your option for retirement [noise] Nineteen eighty two fifty five Ninety six eighty two fifty fine\nWe are not permitted to offer and no statement made during the
