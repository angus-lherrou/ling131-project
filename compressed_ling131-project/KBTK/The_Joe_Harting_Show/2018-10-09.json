important thing of the day the big wind and the big el we dropped on the liberals this week and there's a rule number two the take away from the there is no appeasing liberals or the left\nStop it stop ... members Suzie powder represent powder softening forever that the show to stop\nThe insanity there is no appeasing the left there will be no appeasing of the left I got to have tipped the hard with the conservative review for this when he a great piece out today\nThere is no appeasing these people\nAny Republican out there listening who thinks they're buying some kind of like political chips chips with the folks chips you know like the the poker chips anyone who thinks they're getting some kind of like building up a political bank account political capital with the left\nI'm up on the hill and I'm a bipartisan guy or I'm a bipartisan gal and I crossed the aisle and I'm voting against in title for reform and against tax cuts and the media will love me David Sally Field they love me you really love\nThat they don't mind you they hate you they will turn on you in a minute just like they turned on Susan Collins now listen thank you to she was in college he took a great vote I think\nPeople are going overboard that's what they elected him to do but seriously thank you I don't want to be again Debbie Downer on this thing\nBut this is what Republicans elected Susan Collins to do advance Republican causes it's not a mystery that's why we have a party a party with a unified set of ideas and the collective ideology that that's the bedrock principles there's a lot of differences under the tent but there's some staple things freedom liberty and these are the things Kavanaugh stood for\nBut what happened is Susan Collins is weak and after she took the after she announced she would be a vote\nFor cabinet and essentially put them over the top the left immediately responded on Twitter although she's on their side out a lot of social issues uh on on on a lot of a matter of fact not just social issues that a lot of issues just on their side and she's been a hero with this for bipartisanship they immediately called or what\nA rape apologist one of the most disgusting filthy things you can slur someone with on social media in the media or anywhere\nThere is no appeasing these people they can't stand you folks I'm Sorry\nAgain I'm not talking about your neighbor that Democrat guy you know who you chat with a ... I'm not suggesting you should start like a cold civil war in your neighborhood I'm telling you the radical left\nTheir media cronies and the ... Democrats they are not going to find a redeeming characteristic with you ever with the minute\nYou vote against your finish\nSo stop collectively shining their food [noise] stop surgically attaching your lifted their bus it's not going to work they do care there is no appeasing these people that take away number two\nOf all of a matter of fact it could be ...\nUm their bonds you know we're from are from and give us probably seven to one for you for a little bit [noise]\nYou listen to what David ask from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk and how much time and\nI have throughout the day and I was able to get a lot more work done ... absolutely right I truly love my ex chair and I know you will to trust me once\nDisgusting\nBut since they decided to do that ladies and gentlemen the left blue for themselves and opportunity\nAt the last school appearances the accolades the awards you can't very well ... and believe me I'm not suggesting this was a good idea this was discussing what they did to him\nBut you can reasonably assume at this point that sadly Kavanaugh will be probably protesting for the rest of his life\n\nIf Kavanaugh other family is listening at all God Bless you brother for sticking in there and fight and the good fight you have made enormous sacrifices\nAnd I listen I'm not anybody's preacher anything but I I and I hate quotes because people always use quotes when they have nothing good to say themselves but I Can't say this one enough\nBernard ... natural you know the the book that I didn't mean to a movie right Hobbs story\nWhen he says you know the path to chew happiness as do suffering you know we all live two lives one you learn from in ... and the one you live after that\nKavanaugh is done with life number one the one he learned from he learned what the left will do that\nNow he's living the life after that and he's figuring out that the path to true happiness and accomplishment is going to be through suffering and sadly folks I mean this from the bottom of my heart sadly cabin on his family are going to suffer the rest of their lives just like Clarence Thomas and his family have suffered for the rest of their life\nThese are sterling individuals' these are patriots\nDedicated parents spouses coaches people who've been through more than you and I can imagine in many cases and for the rest of their lives are going to have to deal with liberal nut jobs saying the most disgusting filthy things to them and their families\nBut they blew an opportunity because now Brett Kavanaugh's in life and number two\nHe's learned a lot from that first life he's probably learned a lot from the last days of those first lives that end on that ah that ended on Saturday that life is now over he's now justice cabinet and he's going to have to deal with the left for the rest of his life\n\nChokes me up a bit sometimes thinking about it is a good man it's a good man a decent human being the people I Know when I trust you know I work in the Bush White House I did not know Brett Kavanaugh personally I I make a make no assertions otherwise but I Know people who did\nAnd the people I Know who knew him I trust trust with my my car my kids my house anything they swear by this man swear by this man\nWhat happened to him was an intergalactic embarrassment above highest order it was a cosmic imbalance of grotesque proportions\nBut they blew that and now Brett Kavanaugh is in life number two where he understands\nWhat he was dealing with in what's been put behind them those doors unfortunately are now largely closed for him\nBut what's ahead of them is justice freedom liberty and his seat on\nThe Supreme Court bench to fight for those causes embodied in the constitution\n\nAll right let me take a call here when I usually don't take calls and the first hour but because I always open the phones to ah people on the other side of the aisle to get their opinion and if you want to give us a call the seven seven three one three and one one ah please do liberals conservatives whatever I take 'em all\nLet's go to Carl in New Jersey Carl what are you got for us how are you a thank\nYou for taking my call You're welcome and I I think it went on and on about Mr calving off judge Kavanaugh I listen to the hearing before all this stuff for flu and I and many of my liberal friends educated oh great he's perfectly fine to be on the court\nOver the top of the extraneous stuff with nonsense and people don't really listen to you know you don't look at how they're going to vote one way or the other you're not supposed to say another time lost something whether Republicans gained something the country again someone who could be impartial that being said I Want it to your comment about\nUh your financial future in jeopardy if the liberals are in power sure and history and I said your screeners at last time we had a terrible economic downturn that was under a conservative president not\nWho is the conservative president it we have we had a big\nProblem in a recession that we have a bank problem\nAnd yeah but who is the ... a weight I'm I'm ... I'm confused there was a kid who was the last conservative president Utah I I don't remember one of those\nGeorge Bush Republican ... listen I\n... I I appreciate your opening and I promise I'll give you the chance to respond to try to be a jerk but\nI don't know if it's that you're a liberal and you don't or you aren't really reading on conservatism I Love George W. Bush I worked for the man I Would have literally given my life for him I was a secret service agent ... I'm not being hyperbolic I mean that was my job he was a good and decent human being\nGeorge W. Bush was not exactly a conservative president okay the spending levels of the government spending was out of control we had Medicare part D I like George W. Bush there were some great things that happened the tax cuts package but I think\nInsisting he was a conservative president is a little bit of a stretch so let let me just stop you right he was more of a moderate Republican establishment type I think that's more fair analysis\nThat's like saying that's like me coming out and saying do you have Iraq Obama was a moderate he wasn't he wasn't moderate on any issue at all and I think you know that um so so go back to your your point is that the economy went south of their George W. Bush because of conservatism now\nLet me ask you a question if you don't mind\nWhat conservative ideal\nWhether it be limited government limited government spending limited government intervention the economy cause that recession\nOne word deregulation of how how\nExactly do you figure that\nGlass Steagall happened under Bill Clinton\nBank where all the regulator above ... Iraqi right 'cause I I I'm\nI Know I'm right but but Carl the reason I'm right to focus number one the deregulation you're mentioning happened under Bill Clinton number one and number two\nUh tell me the commercial banks that went under because liberal site this talking point often they said was deregulation and it was the splitting of investment banks were commercial banks so I always say to them okay well they explained to me what commercial banks went under as a result of other essential rely\nNobody here will now all the problems with the stock market and the mortgage industry and\nAllowing call no no I I we can't get pass we see them first me and you have a back and forth you can't just bypass uncomfortable question\nYou said that it was a conservative president that had the last recession I disputed that it was a Republican president now I what I'm trying to suggest you with the recession was not caused by what you said it was caused by and I'd like you'd with knowledge that the deregulation happened under Clinton\nThat's just the fact\nThat well the last now in the coffee right was under Bill Clinton and it had happened for many years before that because what happens is when you have regulations right what happens is they then showing administrations left and right who are bought and paid for by special interests over the decades years in\nDebt yeah but but the coral your point you're making isn't even true I'm asking you if the deregulation\nThat commercial back to the the scare some of the commercial and the and then the joining of the commercial investment bank was the cause of the recession than what commercial banks there should be some evidence that a number of commercial banks went under the answer is you you can't answer because there there there's no way to do it\nSo I listen I Can't go on it's all day because it's it's a walkie talkie I Want to board the audience to that I'm just trying to make a point I appreciate your call though don't hang of it I I think you're a reasonable guy\nI just wish that whereas I can criticize some of the the policies by George W. Bush I thought were wrong I Wish you'd open your eyes to you can't just throw out something like oh deregulation that Bush was terrible and then not follow up at all and presenting the facts and data that's totally irresponsible that's not what happens\nIf you see what what happened is under Bush right at the very end within a year in power when everything fell apart just prior to a bomber being elected All right\nCarl listen I gotta run we're up against the break I'm Sorry but listen thanks for the call but sorry folks that's not what happened I could go on about this all day we we lost because we had we had a cheap money problem\nWe had a bunch of G. S. these government sponsored enterprises in Fannie and Freddie that incentivize people to buy homes they simply could not afford that was the genesis of the housing crisis that ripple through the economy\nMaturity mismatch is it was it's a very simple problem to observe looking at it in retrospect and claiming it was a massive deregulatory effort that happened other Clinton therefore the
