these corporate companies which are south thousands of them are just Monsanto that will have all these illegal aliens are ready to come walk for Monsanto\nLow wages\nI I'm not disputing that I'm not out uh let me let me say this real quick let's go back to something you said the beginning and then and then we'll continue on\nOn your your your turn to Saudi okay I don't act like all legal immigrants are are coming here to break laws I Know they are\nOkay\nEvery moment and we'll sit with facts not emotion so Kay is it a fact that if you come into the country illegally every moment of every day whether you're sleeping working whatever it may be that you are breaking the laws of the United states of America\nI think we're going to do this\nBut when when they get Michael Michael it's a simple questions on a trick question you called me okay I I didn't call you the idea that you say I knew you were going to say that again\nAnswer my question you act like it is um some how ridiculous\nThat I say that every illegal immigrant is a law breaker that is their intent to break American law that's when they break into this country and they don't solve the paperwork and tried to come in this country is an actual legal migrant which I have no problem with\nYou try to act like the the breaking of the law is not breaking the law so you say well I Know all you all you talk show host you act like these people were all wall breakers\nThey actually are Michael I'm not saying they all have the intent just to rape or to murder\nI Do think they all have the intend to steal cars they're stealing from America when they come in this country legally\nThey're stealing from the American worker they're stealing jobs they're not paying taxes the right way many of them under cut jobs and make money in cash and the number one stimulated Mexico's economy is illegal immigrants who take the money and send it back to Mexico so to act as if\nThe action of breaking into a country is it means that you're not a law breaker ... it's absolute auditor insanity\nSo I'll start back with a question you ... you said that all you talk show host act like these people are breakers I'm not I I'm not the one that made the law the law is the law Michael the law says you cannot come into this country illegally\nBy that definition they are all breaking the law when they're here the entire time there he is\nA law that\nSays companies like ... though and it's legal for them to hire oil and\nI'm In favor of e verify I'm In favor also of going after those that hire illegals I've said for a long time if you want to clean up this country and get rid of illegal immigrants you don't have to deport any of them all you have to do is start seizing hotels restaurants cars equipment on\nJob sites when you find people that are working and employing people illegally\nAgree with you we have a problem with hiring the illegal immigrants but you have a bigger problem with that you believe that these illegal immigrants or somehow\nI agree with you we have a problem with hiring the illegal immigrants but you have a bigger problem with that you believe that these illegal immigrants or somehow not breaking our wall when they come across the border illegally and you act like it's at\nPropaganda when it's not it's fact it is propaganda to treat people\nLike they are doing nothing wrong when in fact they're breaking our laws that as propaganda started\nFortune of all with all these companies that are really oil outcome\nStart up so let me get a straight Michael why can't we start enforcing the law the way the president wants to do which is it start enforcing the law at the border so these people don't even have the opportunity to come in this country illegally and then get work illegally why why are you still get hit out\nWhy you're exactly right with that but when it comes to\nFederal federal level all these other constituents that you know the politicians rooms that money how big as much time do\nI I look I don't know how much money they make I don't know why you're keep focusing on one single employee there's there's ... there's Fifteen million illegal immigrants in this country maybe even more than that I'm giving it a low number\nHere there are thousands tens of thousands of companies you know I'm not I'm not saying you're crazy listen to what I'm saying let's not focus on one employer one person let's focus on the factors tens of thousands of employers in America then employ illegal immigrant labor labor\nI agree it's a problem but if you cut off\nThe flow of the illegal immigrant late ... immigrant labor then that is a great starting point to get this under control why would you ... it's a two part solution I'm In favor of that but when you have four thousand plus people come in your border right now\nThe president's job and the end they're broadcasting it live on social media\nThey're literally walking with the middle finger to this country saying we don't care about your laws and were coming into your country\nAnd we're going to work in your country and we're going to undercut your wages and we're going to hurt the American worker and there's nothing you can do to stop us and this is how arrogant we are screw you America that is the president's job\nTo make sure that those people are in handcuffs if they cross our border and immediately sent home\nAs far as far as that a news story whenever there's a milestone now is that was rehearsed\nI wouldn't say I really want to go as far as saying that\nThe Democratic party at that rehearsed\nOf course they do Michael I this is all propaganda for the midterms\nThis is all\nPropaganda for the midterms Democrats want to come out and say we love people we love illegal immigrants we Nancy Pelosi the only time she basically gets pissed off as if you were actually advocating\nFor eight ... if you are trying to be a law and order president or a law and order congressmen that's about the only time that an supposed to be really gets mad at you because she stands up for the illegal immigrant now the American worker she stands up for people to break the law not people that are\nBy by the law and then she threatens people when you get in her weight just like she did this week\nDonald Trump put out I'm In a minute ago hey down on ... you know remember when they threw a big party at\nThe White House this is coming from Nancy Pelosi celebrating them passing their bill to get to get\nProtections for people with preexisting conditions I mean she's talking right now about health care to try to move away from the other issue which is she's threatening the American worker the American family with her propaganda which is to give illegal immigrants the ability to come into this country illegally\n\nAnd ... and do that with no repercussions and it's for one reason she desperately need them\nTo be able to vote that is what this is actually about the Democrats are terrified that they're not going to win back the house and Senate and they were gonna do it before they did this character assassination and Brett Kavanaugh and it woke up conservatives who honestly we were kind of a sleep\nWe had a big when we think alright Donald Trump's doing a good job I maybe I won't worry about voting and they woke up a bunch of you and I believe without the Brett Kavanaugh character assassination we would have definitely lost his Senate I think now we're headed in the right direction it's not over yet but I think we're at least hitting the right direction and Democrats are terrified\nThat they're not going to get the house in the Senate and they need new voters in this country because they don't have enough right now to win this thing I mean they want I mean Hillary Clinton loss of Donald Trump\nYou don't think they're freaking out right now and they need new voters and the way to do is get illegals in here and give them ... and then they know they can win every
