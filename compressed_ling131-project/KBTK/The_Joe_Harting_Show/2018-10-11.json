I Would flip out that joy when I taught them\nI'll tell you I think there's two aspects of this first\nOf all I mean you saw this with the kids in the high school that had the shooting last year down in your state where you know they almost immediately they looked like they were media trained professionals with the anti gun anti Second Amendment narrative\nAnd that didn't happen by accident this is what they learned in school in our public schools they they they learn all of these talking points in tactics they literally do\n'em but secondly the for those who are not so plugged in and so organized and so uh you know the fed into the Olin ski tactics that we're seeing on the streets Joyce\nJust for your average person who leads to the left they've been told for the last two years that America just elected Adolf Hitler\nThey've been told for the last decades the Republican Party is this close to being the Nazi Party in this country if they truly believe that the Nazis are in charge of it makes sense that they would protest the way they do doesn't it\nThey're dividing the country they they are\nYesterday are\nEither absolutely right to it I think and this Fritz disrespectful\nAll right so what are you going to do to make sure that Rick Scott comes to the U.S\nI I how every you know my friends my family because everybody watches CNN and everything else and they're so against him I Can't even believe that themselves from Fox News everybody talks about that but you know what they tell the truth they talk bad about him or good about him I think oh the truth\nMost mostly Joyce All right well I Hope that you're an energized out there I Hope you realize how important this is I Hope you do what you can to make sure the Rick Scott is a plus one for the Republicans down there in your state of Florida and I also hope you stay dry and safe\nHow about a Peggy also in Florida saint Petersburg is kind of close to the action there Peggy you are next up on the mark within

time\n[laughter] [laughter] well\nI tell you what I'm going to do in my family were willing to share with bullets\nYeah that that's that's what's needed right now and and it it's sad you know honestly down I think most Americans they don't necessarily just vote straight wind party this party or that party like like in England or a parliamentary system but in this case this election isn't really about the candidates it's about which party were giving power to\nExactly exactly uh you can I give it in Trump is right for the Trump is right when he said that you can I give ... to ... you know you
