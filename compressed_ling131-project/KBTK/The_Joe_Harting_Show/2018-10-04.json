[noise]\nMy club in Ninety seven one the big talker\nStimulating [noise]\nIn order to believe Dr Ford you have to suspend [noise]\nYour ability to reason given three different answers as to when the assault happened\nMid eighties early eighties and all of a sudden actually was the summer in Nineteen eighty two after she lawyers up\nYou have to believe that she waited waited\nReally until now to reveal that the individual who assaulted her was in fact judge Kavanaugh\nNever said anything to anybody else although her husband now has circled back and said oh I remember her telling me doing marriage therapy okay we'd like to see the notes they won't return they won't release the nose so that's not believable\nShe can't remember key details about the night who invited her to the party\nHow she heard about the party how she got to the party how she left the party where the houses exactly\nCity and of course most importantly how she left the party with whom she left the party how she traveled back home when she got back home\n\nThe alleged assault has not been corroborated by single person including none of the people she's named including as well\nHer lifelong girlfriend ... that apparently is not change based on reports today\nShe hasn't provided a consistent account of the alleged assault\n\nAnd she had big trouble remembering important recent events like in her discussion with the Washington Post reporter whether she actually gave portions ever therapists notes to the report and others in July the whole copy of the therapists notes read from the therapists no she doesn't remember\nShe can't remember if she had an actual copy of the therapists knows when she called the Washington Post where she had gone to her therapist's office and read them now I Can't remember any of that\n\nShe won't provide the notes to the committee\n\nShe won't provided to the committee she can't remember the day that she had the polygraph though this is very reason just what a month six weeks eight weeks ago where there was one of the day her grandmother passed away or not she can't remember if it was video or audio recorded and the committee would like to know they want to see\nIf in fact she was traumatized during the course of the [noise] excuse me lie detector test or she claims\n\nShe talks about the psychological impact\nIt had that she doesn't want to fly she was difficulty flying now we know that was a flat out lie and say that yes a flat outline she's flown west coast east coast east coast the west coast she's found the Hawaii French Polynesia Costa Rica all over the world\nBut when she was asked to shop for a hearing she couldn't fly although it is said that she was already on the east coast\nShe didn't know that the Senate Judiciary committee Republicans the majority had offered to go to California\nTo interview her in any form\nAnd uh\nWhy didn't you know ... people say her lawyers must have withheld that information maybe the large didn't withhold the information maybe she just didn't give a forthright answer\nWe know from her ex boyfriend\nThat she never mentioned Kavanaugh's name she never mentioned sexual assault in the six years that they live together and the few years before that that they dated we know she had no problem with claustrophobia because she had an apartment that was five hundred square feet that's a small apartment\nThat's a very small apartment\nWe know that she never mentioned Kevin O's name to her boyfriend her live in boyfriend have six years\nSo you have to believe the unbelievable\nTo believe her testimony against Brett Kavanaugh you have to believe the unbelievable you must suspend your reasoning and now that I've gone all through this she's not the bubble lady\nShe came forward she said it was her civic duty she's presented herself to the American people and we get the judge said it's not the only body that gets the judge you and I get the judge and we don't have to self censor have to be rude and hateful and all the rest I'm not that we're not doing that\nNow what a cabin I'll say that was so unbelievable or contradicted absolutely nothing that I'm aware of what that he may have had more drinks one day then another day he's the one who showed up with this calendars\nHe's the one who had witnesses who said he was never there\n\nBut you see the FBI didn't interview hammer afford now according to forge lawyers who are very upset and of course the Democrats are one in the same but that's not the nature of this investigation it's not a criminal investigation\nThey testified in public under penalty of perjury there's nothing else for them to say\nSo why do we continue to play what see what the Democrats we should play brass knuckles where the Democrats say enough already and Mr flake and ms Collins of ms Murkowski you want to throw in with the Democrats go ahead we're having a vote this is over\nWe're not going to participate in any further sham we're not going to participate now and the trashing the FBI I'm not talking about the senior people at the FBI now they're trashing the FBI if there lecturing us for Eighteen months about the FBI\nThat's not the senior officials in the FBI who are doing these interviews these are special agents I have no doubt the hard working men and women in the FBI that the Democrats\nClaimed alike but they hate all law enforcement let's be honest\nSo enough so now we don't need to deal honestly we don't need to deal\nWith people who are\nDiabolical diabolical\nThat includes flight that includes Collins that includes Murkowski who brought us to this point I guarantee you\n\nIf it were their husbands are flights wife who are being treated this way they wouldn't agree you know what maybe we should extend they've suffered I wake\nWhy what\nTook place this weekend endless speculation endless analysis of what\n\nThe insanity is ubiquitous it's all over\nThe media all over the media I'll get to them later as I always do\nSuch I actually believe Dr Ford Israeli to suspend the ability to use your brain\nAs applies to Brett Kavanaugh [noise]\nIf something happened to her and it may well have nothing to do

is the questioner go ahead\nIs a market disrespecting disregarded I find it can be out early this ethic that's\nHow this is this is ... who's of course subjective\nI find it to be utterly disgusting
