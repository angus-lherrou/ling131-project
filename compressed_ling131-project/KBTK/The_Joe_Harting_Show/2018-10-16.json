well I mean they'll need to go into the details\nBut talking to my account and I was absolutely floored I could really couldn't believe it when we found out how much money the government I was astonished I really was\nThat will be fine I mean we you know we keep money aside to pay for we don't we don't live a frugal lifestyle at all I mean I excuse me a spendthrift lifestyle the opposite we actually kinda were not cheap or anything but we just that we work a lot so we don't get to go out\nI'm telling you I was floored I thought he had a decimal point wrong\n\nAnd I play it straight you know because I I'm like you know a lot of liberals like John Kerry report their boats in Rhode Island played straight so whatever my bill is I don't like the law change it but if the law steaks you still got I got to pay\nAnd I was floored this is the first time my life I thought to myself\nI'm Serious folks and my wife is probably going to kill me for talking about this but it's okay I made it because I think this needs to get out there I grew up\nAt the low end at best the middle class and being generous 'cause I'm ... I'm not a sob story\nThe low end of middle class at best okay\nLike at one point the bologna for dinner kind of you know what I'm ... now they're middle class like yeah we will a mistake was not it was a hot commodity mind what it was it was ... we were not eating rabbis\nOkay McDonald's was like the restaurant to go\nI worked my butt off when there was that the police department in the cemetery in the supermarket and the secret service\nAnd you finally get to a point in your life and you for the first time you make what could be legitimately life changing amount of money right and you want to do so many things I'm telling you we had so many ideas and some of them were so\nI mean we're going to be able to do I don't want to be dramatic about this\nBut you think to yourself I got to give it to these guys these idiots in D.C to do was\nTo do with if you're serious to do what I don't mind my cat I Swear to you on my life the constitutional role of government I\nMilitary guys take my money [laughter] is we need courts I get it that's why we have a constitution but you weren't flushing your money down the toilet bowl the people who have no idea what to do with it\nWe need we ... we need seriously some constitutional controls on their ability to take our money they are they're just burning it\n\nIt's the first time in my life I thought I could I could have bought my mother in law house and it said I'm giving it to some bow tie wearing bureaucrats in D. C. too flushed down the toilet bowl\nThe worst unbelievable and I I think it's because\nGrew up at the lower and middle class and then in the secret service middle class and upper middle class later on I guess\nI mean I don't know I don't know what the categories I don't care I'm again I'm not trying to make the story more dramatic than it needs to be\nI guess it said I genuinely respected dollar because I Know what it's like and then when you finally can help other people right you're like gosh I could do so much with this and you're forced to turn it over and they just mega amounts to the

really rich which I'm\nNot but I just I'm paid by every ounce of it it just sucks so bad\nBuild my business everything we can hire new people to write for the website ... and we can't 'cause I've got to give it to these guys and ladies in D.C\nTo burn right sorry get off track you can tell them kind of hard on this topic is another number about the fair share that liberals don't say we pay\nThe top fifty percent of taxpayers top fifty percent pay Ninety\nSeven percent of all income taxes Ninety seven percent the top fifty percent of earners pay Ninety seven percent Ninety seven cents of every dollar of taxes\nNinety seven Ninety nine point seven Ninety seven percent why does that matter it matters folks\nBecause the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers total logically then pay three percent if the top fifty pay Ninety seven percent the top fifty percent of earners than about fifty three percent of the bachelor\nSo this Bloomberg peace they did it interesting analysis they said well let's figure out what percentage of the highest end or is this will make sense at a second I promise what percentage or number of the highest end earners also\nPay an equivalent three percent of the actual like the bottom fifty percent of the earners in the country\nLadies and gentlemen the evil rich that the left talks about the Bernie Sanders tides\nI'm using their terminology show how this pure stupidity of their comments you're never going to believe is the top zero zero one percent of income tax payers in other words just fourteen hundred people\nFourteen hundred not fourteen thousand one comma for ... for the lips fourteen hundred the fourteen hundred top earners in the United states\nPay the same percentage of the tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers in the country\nTell me again please with a straight face\nWith a straight face how they're not paying their fair share fourteen hundred people pay the same equivalent percentage of the income tax or at the bottom fifty percent of earners in the country and he got Bernie Sanders a one percent or of so you're not paying their fair share really party do even though these numbers\nThat is insane fourteen hundred people pay the same percentage of the tax law as the fifty percent the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers in this country that's amazing now you understand why we got to just break the narratives completely\nYou're ready for the rich no no no no no no I made it for the economy and you have no idea what the numbers are fair share you don't even know what a fair share is\nFair shall we usually make after ... don't be stupid talking point rich do Peter Fisher they don't pay pay as much as the bottom fifty percent of the country are you crazy\nA man of fire but to say All right you
