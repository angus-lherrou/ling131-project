that number\nYou know what congratulations to that twenty five percent you know these are the people that are meticulous and how they manage their finances right mhm and their confidence in what they're doing but you know you know when I look at this go let's talk to the\nSeventy nine percent that aren't confident because you know we want to really help the masses here in in giving them some good advice\nSome foundation into how to plan for retirement and he'd like pre planned for retirement and what to do in retirement because today's show is going to be very exciting\nAnd anybody that listens to the show we all started to be creative about talking about different things and I think the Seventy nine percent is who I Am really wanting to talk to today because I think I've got some great information but I'm sure the Twenty one can also twenty percent of people that are confident and the reason we found that there's a group of\nPeople that have confidence in what's going on with their retirement\nBecause these are the folks that have put in the time\nTo understand how to do things correctly and they've hired in advisor earlier in their career or earlier and started a you know putting money away little at a time and I was talking about you know we talked about do you know how you feel a bucket full of water how\nDrop at a time one little thing on the little bit of time right and so I think a lot of people are looking at the big the bucket and go wow how am I going to fill the bucket\nBut it's done systematically and it's done with intention so you know if it's a very easy process if\nYou give it time so you know I always talked about you know I'm a procrastinator when they first stuff you know especially if it has to do with manual labor yeah and uh you know I just moved I sold my house and I moved into another house that I own\nAnd I literally I didn't have time to get to the move and so when I started packing and and I had a deadline and you know I really did it to myself I put myself under so much pressure\nTo get everything done within a short period of time\nWhere I you know if I had the time I could have taken the time\nAnd done it systematically over a period of time where I was not stressing myself out so this is how I see people deal with retirement you know they're trying to feel that you haul with all their stuff\nIn a matter of five years when they had a you know twenty five or thirty year career where they could have done it little at a time and they could have really approached this in a very systematic and stress free manner so that's where we want to really talk about is how to take stressed out of your life\nAnd if it's stress for his happy\nThis is the retirements roadmap she'll find a retirement network [noise]\nWe're back thanks for joining us today on their retirement roadmap show powered by vora financial\nGrill I'm generally that alongside ... more I eat owner and founder of more financial group based or families across northern Arizona\nYou can find them online at ... financial dot com that vora V. as in Victor Oh our a financial dot com\nGarnish during our working years if we want to reduce our income taxes one way to do that it can make less income but what are some strategies for anything have taxes in retirement\nYet you know reducing your income would be great just go talk to your employer and telling me on a pay cut ...\nShirt indefinitely arrange it you know but that's what our real estate for anyone and so you know here's where we figure it out is I've been doing taxpayer with my clients for years now and what we found is that people that understand or are working with advisors that understand how to help them manage their taxes\nAre the ones going to pay less to the government and I would rather if I was you know if I was your advisor\nWouldn't you want me to make sure that you keep more money for yourself scoring giving it to the government because you know what\nGovernment's not going to send you a little thank you car Christmas card a birthday card saying hey you know a great job they use all this money if I Am so tax planning is really really critical because lots of people don't understand or or they haven't looked at I should say I don't understand is\nThat what you don't know you really don't know\nSo when we started doing planning with our clients you know what we're trying to help them understand is that here's how much money you're making and as years become you'll probably make more money because of your pay raises and so forth\nBut how do you keep more money for yourself and and if we can divert some of that money to go into your retirement account or have more money go into some tax favored investment strategies you know that's where you're going to you know really create wealth\nBecause if you keep giving it away you're not going to have any for yourself because the government is going to be getting all your money\nAnd also understanding you know how the current tax law works and I think the new tax law those past I've been doing a lot of work shop at you know I'm the different community colleges throughout um northern Arizona\nOn retirement and taxes\nAnd it's interesting when I have people in those rooms and I ask questions about what do you think of the current tax law\nA quite a few people says I don't know and some people say well you know Trump past\nThat'd be good for the big corporations are not for us here's the thing I really don't care what the president and so you know this is not about you know political this is about the law the new tax laws in place you know we want to do\nIs really understand it\nAnd utilize it so that we can put more money in our pocket you know rather than give it to the government and if it's used correctly or in your finances you can actually save a lot of money on taxes and so what I've been doing is I've been talking about taxes in retirement\nAnd showing them all the opportunities there right there for us\nAnd most people aren't taking advantage of I Would say even one tenth\nOf one percent of the strategies and the new tax law because they don't know about it\nAnd a lot of their advisors don't know about it because most advisor said well you know I help you manage your money but taxes not really or a cup of tea but you know when you do comprehensive planning that's where we'll we were able to help people so that's one portion of it right\nThe other thing is a lot of people that are thinking about retirement or getting very very close or like ready to make some big decisions in their retirement such as Social Security\nWhat we're finding is that most people have no idea\nWhat is the best strategy for them I've had people say well you know we don't live very long you know family or I don't anticipate living very long so I'm going to take my money out a way to start taking money from Social Security so they can get their money out of it\nBut the reality is people are living in a lot longer modern medicine has come leaps and bounds from you know even five years ago or you know let alone ten years ago right and and so a lot of things are changing for some people are living longer\nPeople are a lot more useful today than you know they've ever been and and you know I'm Talking to my clients in their sixties and seventies and eighties\nAnd the eighties is a new sixties in the sixties and the new forties who you know right in and think about it like if you look at your friends or your your family members and you go\nWow you know somebody's like Seventy Seventy five years old and you go well you're supposed to be this active you know because statistically you know I go back Twenty years\nPeople in their seventies they're like well our lives almost over you know my clients in their eighties are booking vacations five years out and you know if you if you look around if you listen to the show you know people that are older but\nYouth so I mean there are more active today than ever been and you know which is fantastic\nBut the downside to that is that people are going to live so long that they need the money to last a lifetime and without a plan\nThey're going to go go through that money and to me that's a significant concern when you don't planning\nAnd understanding how much money you're going to take out in retirement so one of the strategies is maximizing your Social Security benefit ... and how to get the most out of Social Security\nAnd that's one source of income in retirement there was actually a survey that was done by transfer America\nAnd this was done about a year ago and they said the fifty one percent of baby boomer feel that they're building a strong enough nest egg settles listen for fifty one percent right which is great you know what I mean which is good to see that people are\nAnd they are involved and so forth but you know here's really something we also have to look at you know what has the\nUh the temperament or the the weather has been in the in the stock market over the last ten years right\nAnd we've had a ten year bull market after the market correction in you know seven or eight the markets have been going up and we've almost a decade of fantastic I mean we've had ups and downs I mean I've got that straight line up\nBut you can have peaks and valleys and all that stuff but we've had a bull market at the end of the day you know bull market me in some markets have been going up and bear market is markets are going down\nAnd said a lot has to be confused that so I Want to clarify that Super Bowl marketing the market's going up so if you're in a strong market conditions in your portfolio have been growing and you've been taking a risk with your portfolio and of course you're going to feel confident and I'm not minimizing what trans America saying but what I'm wanting to people to\nWhat I what I Want people to start thinking about\nIs that you know when we were kids we used to love to play with pendulum and you know we had pendulum ... the one with the little metal thing but like about six or seven little metal balls that you know you know which one I'm Talking about right on the on your desk yeah\nRight so I was talking about pendulum either because the analogy goes when the market's going out the pendulum swinging one way mhm and you know and everybody's making money everybody's happy the real estate prices going up and all that but when the pendulum start swinging the other way\nAnd the more people I talked to are more concerned because the markets are hitting new highs\nAnd what happens what is your strategy if it goes the other way\nAnd if you're taking more risk than you should or if you do not have a strategy to deal with the next market correction\nWhat's going to happen to let's talk about the fifty one percent of people that are feeling very confident that they have a strong mistake when the pendulum goes the other way and if they're not prepared to step out of the way they're going to do that pendulum going to basically turn into a wrecking ball going through their portfolio\n... and you know like every market conditions that we've had\nYou know like every market correction W hat not only A People's investment accounts had lost about fifty percent of the value of the account\nBut on the other hand you know people that own real estate such as primary home or rental properties are the real estate investments all those properties or down about half so overnight\nYou wake up and you're half what you were ... wow you know Kevin said in\nIt is devastating and I think you know if anybody knows anyone that was thinking about retirement back in Nineteen Ninety nine two thousand two thousand one or also a again and it was seven or eight if they're planning a retiring or they're retired\nAnd they have to depend on that money for as part of their retirement income retirement pot and if they will continue taking the money out are based on their lifestyle they are sure to run out of money so preservation\nRisk is good risk is healthy but preservation strategies are extremely important in any kind of planning to to figure out that\nBut if you call in to the radio show and you could do this anytime but if you call it to the radio show my numbers nine to a two to six eight to five five\nIt's nice to eight two to six talk and I will give you this book for absolutely free and one thing I'll ask you to do is once you read the book I Would love for you to pass it on to somebody else they could benefit from that so it's my gift to you\nAnd your gift to somebody else because I think if we can all kinds of St choir sheet and keep more money for ourselves that's what we want to do you know government will always make more money because they're all those people out there making all this tax mistakes and let them pay the taxes\nWe shouldn't talking today with the ... he is owner and founder of for a financial group that phone number one more time if you said nine to wait two to six eighty two fifty five or nine to ... to sex talk\nTheir mission worse than other things need to think about when we are looking at our tax situation and the taxes we might be facing in retirement\nBecause one of the things I talked earlier in the show was required minimum distribution mhm so are empty a requirement distribution comes with significant amount of penalties for not taking enough money out of that plan so for example most people think that you have to be Seventy in half and you have what's called a mandatory distribution\nBut one of the things that I'm also starting to see is that people are inheriting money\nFrom their sibling from their friends from their parents and what they're doing is they're inheriting retirement accounts\nAnd if you inherit an IRA and you could do two things one cash it out pay the tax will be done with it\nBut most people are going to do that if it's a large chunk of money because that's a pretty significant tax right\nMhm yeah what you should be doing is making that an inherited IRA meaning that the Irish stays a as an IRA but what you're supposed to do is take out what's referred to as a required\nMinimum distribution for inherited the IRA and winning inherit that I write you regardless your age so you could be Fifteen Years old\nYou inherit an IRA from a parent or grandparent you're supposed to take out a distribution out of that I write in your Fifteen Years old and if you don't just one big penalty\nOr fifty now yeah I could you not there was a fifty percent penalty on the monies that you did not take out of the fifties so not safe all year fifty five fifty so you know because most people\nAre taught that you cannot take any money out of the IRA account until you're fifty nine and a half years old\nAnd you know so what happens with inherited I ... I just I I the reason I tell you all the stories are on the show is because this is actually stuff that I've seen happen\nAnd so what happens here is if you don't take money out you have a fifty percent penalty retirement accounts ... when you turned Seventy and a half and so if you have your own retirement account not inherited but your own retirement account\nAnd and when you turned Seventy and a half you're supposed to take a distribution of from eight Seventy in half\nAnd moving forward for the rest of your life\nSo let's talk about you know there's you know we talked about the powers your book\nSo what happens is that most Americans haven't thought this thing that far out [noise]\nSo what happens is when you get when you retire let's say you're getting a income from Social Security and you just happen to be one of those lucky people that actually also has pension and that's enough money for you to last you know to live off of\nAnd ... Seventy and a half and the government says Gen you have to take more money out of this plan mhm and so you\nDo you're required minimum distribution like I said if you don't pay the yeah is there any way right you're going to do it right and as you get older what happens you life expectancy get shorter and as life expectancy you know according to charge\nGet shorter meaning the government wants to take more\nAnd more and more money out of your retirement account so what is the end result the end result is that not only you're having to ... your retirement account but you're getting pushed into a higher tax bracket number one and the second thing is that unknowingly\nYou're making ... you know what what happens is your Social Security benefits or the way the tax shark works that almost eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits will become taxable if it's not today so you're going to get pushed into higher tax bracket\nAnd especially with trillions of dollars in debt we have governments that are raised or taxes it's inevitable\nSo if you're concerned\nAbout taxes and you're concerned about Social Security you're concerned about potentially avoiding penalties on retirement accounts and so forth uh gives a cult night to a two to six eight to five five nine to eight two to six talk it's nice to eight two to six talk\nDamage your eyes owner and founder of for a financial group this is the retirement a roadmap shell power vying for a financial group fled had to a break we'll hear some final insights from ... on the other side [noise]\n\nYou're listening to the retirement roadmap show fund the retirement news networks\n[noise]\nWhy she was more of a natural to handle your retirement because we provide objective advice and concierge service investments insurance retirement planning all in one location we also partner with qualified attorneys and CPAs to provide complete\nFinancial strategies for our clients we use a variety of investment and insurance products to custom designed retirement plans and they can get finds a way to look at their future and we help you stay on the path toward financial independence\n[noise] if you don't want to do it yourself and want to work with a team degree to financial strategy for your future give us a call nine to a two to six eighty two fifty five that's nine to a two to six eighty two fifty five [noise] would you rather get retirement advice from some TV show host who doesn't know anything about your own for a financial\nThem show you some of your options for retirement Ninety eight fifty six eighty two fifty five Ninety wait two to six eighty two fifty five we are not permitted to offer and no statement made during the show shot constitute an accident legal at night we should talk to U.S policy professional before making any decisions about your personal situation and that's an advisory services offering\nThree or four or financial fifty I'll I'll theoretically certain ...\nAnd that's an advisory services offered through Bora wealth management P.
