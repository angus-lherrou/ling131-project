I\nIn Arizona for us financial dot com and when\nHe and his flat again and you brought along a number of today right\nThat's right that's right and I need to introduce Stuart Lee Daniels Stewart\nJeff Bridges\nSome stores you know what I'm new to deceive you're\nGlad to be here I previously around the last election cycle actually during the primary rap or the or one of the house of representatives yeah a great experience and\nAll around northern Arizona and and you might have seen my billboards and yard signs etc all throughout the northern Arizona region and a very active in the community and a look gorgeous to making a positive difference and helping folks out\nIn the reason store joined the firm is because he does have quite a financial background and you know I've had stored number of years ago as the vice president of the chamber of commerce journal and then there's a slice of chamber right and you know the thing is you know Stewart you really have a beautiful face or radio so\nI could do to help out your guy ... big dig out of it is fair\nEnough but no real super excited at world financial just do it on our team and you know he's going to be servicing in working\nFair enough [laughter] but no we were super excited\n... financial just Stewart on our team and you know he's going to be servicing and working with people in the northern Arizona so we have an office here in Flagstaff downtown Flagstaff as well as we have an office in Sedona that services or the tri city area which is\nYou know the ... what camp Verde area a plug down and so forth right low growth out there in in great opportunity to help even more folk\nWell I'm Glad to have you in CDL as well Stewart and I know it it's going to be hurting cats today with stuff that you that well the\nWhere we just got an honorary today [laughter] we're here you're the roads between two door [laughter] we have already a coffee you know that's why we're ready to you know I dabble\nI got my work cut out for me that you know one of the things we're going to focus on today that we were chatting about a little bit off line is financial wellness and how much having a healthy mind and body really goes hand in hand with having healthy finances\nYou know what most of us know what to expect when we go in for a checkup on our physical health but we don't know what to expect for a financial check out so that's where I'd like to begin today in garnish how do we get started with that\nWell you know me being a doctor on radio so I think I guess I can talk about financial help [laughter] so I've always talked to people about a financial checkup\nIs extremely important and you know you have to have just like you would go get your you know oil changed on every three thousand miles and it's funny in our industry is that the you know there's a saying in our industry that guys take better care of their vehicles and take care of their health you know and in women\nLive longer because they take better care of their health and so that's kind of important aspect of what we're doing here\nOne of the things we found was that like you're supposed to do\nA physical every year with a doctor in and get a check up and so for doing that on your finances extremely important as well because you know a lot of times you don't realize there was a problem and you know you're too far down the road\nAnd you know if there's any kind of corrections or strategy change that has to happen we want to be able to implement and make those changes as soon as necessary\nWe're talking today with ... he's the owner and founder of our financial group and see where it may Daniel insurance is well he's part of the team that for a financial and I'm generally jak alongside it gives the retirement ... power to pay for a financial group\nIs that when you get in your car and you start driving\nAnd the first stop you would say would be you know going if you're on I forty you'll be going towards Williams so first stop will be Williams then it'd be so women then there'd be Kingman\nSo theoretically when you're looking at this you're not getting to check your tires and things like that until you get to a gas station right and if you need gas that's what you're doing\nBut what happens is if there's a problem between that distance you're absolutely unaware of four fifty sixty ... even a hundred miles versus what happens in retirement planning\nIs that a lot of times people say you don't you know check a couple of years or you know most of the most of what we've seen is\nThat people have come in and they said you know I had a financial plan done ten years ago mhm and I go and then what and they were ... years ago and I think we're on track I I don't know I I go how can you be so sure or are you sure\nAnd most people I sit down with they really don't look they're on track or are they just goes you know life is happening\nAnd we have an advisor that's kind of managing or accounts and I think we should be good when most people don't realize is when I first started in this industry back in the early nineties\nThe rate of return or projections that were being used were significantly higher\nThan what we consider using today and I was speaking to another financial advisor in our community\nAnd realize that they're using a pretty robust rate of return in projections on their portfolio so unique always looks like you're going to make so much more money and then you create your spending plan around how much money you think you're going to have\nAnd then turn your good to have a significant shortfall because it didn't perform up to that level\nAnd so part of this also is we want to talk about risk management you know if you look back you know this year will use this year as an example I I don't want to go very dated on the timing but if you just look back this year we've\nHad significant volatility in the market and the recent months uh we've had quite a bit and I think people don't realize if the markets are up or down because you know sometimes they turn on the TV and it says you\nKnow the S. and P. hits new highs are Dow Jones industrial average has hit new high and they think that they're making all this money but then they don't realize that too after that the Dow Jones industrial\nHas gone data of five hundred boy or something like that you don't know maybe several thousand points in back in that case so those are the kinds of things that you know\nFive hundred points or something like that you know maybe several thousand points in ... in that case\nSo those are the kinds of things that you know when we create a plan that's ... dress we're really addressing the safety component of your plan so here's the thing if you're going to Los Angeles and here\nAnd the road map you know your Google Drive or whatever you you have any more what do you call them nowadays\nWherever the navigation system navigation ... GPS right you know I I still go back and think about you know like I was thinking about the Rand McNally road atlas writes most of us travel back in the day before all this stuff came out you know we have to we actually had to lay it out and make a plan\nAnd really understand that you know if you drove respectable speed limit and you don't read concerning traffic and so forth that you would get to your destination in a certain period of time\nAnd that's where people are really losing the focus is that you know too much electronic says in the way too much garbage is going in their heads from watching TV and so forth\nAnd everybody's chasing returns what I mean by that is that you know people are looking to make as much money as possible but they don't realize what the downside stroke up that would be right\nAnd if you just kind of go back and look at\nWhat happened to two thousand seven two thousand eight ... you're in Tucson at that time 'cause I was new saw you know big cities even worse\nWell absolutely seeing if folks there were a hundred percent tied into real estate because at the time you know the real estate market was booming in the early two thousand meant and things were great until it wasn't and people lost half of\nTheir their value overnight they couldn't give it away correct right I mean we just saw people were unprepared and and they didn't have that they didn't realize that things aren't going to keep going the same way whether it's up or down and so not to panic and they're not the whole holistic approach\nBut it also provides opportunities as well you know how to\nWrite so you know I mean you know when we look at the market so we're seeing you know we have big upswing in the market and then you see big down swinging the market right and then\nWe see panic and we see we do you get to see all kinds of emotions right you know greed fear panic all that stuff right anger and\nYou know we we find is that when people don't have a plan emotions get the best of\nRight and and bad things you know we all go through difficulty through every day right that doesn't mean it's going to ruin our day\nAnd then that's the whole thing that we have a plan to move forward whatever it might be as we're going on a vacation going on a trip whatever it is a we have a plan that we're gonna move forward and and that's how we approach or the financial plans as well and how important that is because without that plan that's when the parent accepting that\nWe've had a bull market for probably a decade at this point right and\nIt's been well you know like I mean if you look at the ten years the markets been up but you know the volatility that's have come into play has been pretty significant in two thousand eleven you know if you're just at home and one for giggles if you look at the Dow chart in two thousand eleven\nAnd you go back to look at two thousand two thousand eight charged\nIt was an exact mimic the markets and the charts where exactly mimicking that instead of going down\nWhat happened was the federal government stepped in and then they get infused much money in the market right and that's what kind of ... the mark it up and it's gone up since the end you know in the long term we see the markets will go up by the fact is that\nIf there was a major market correction\nAnd you know you are retired and you're living off this money\nAnd you're taking out say a thousand a couple of thousand maybe even three thousand dollars a month out of that account\nAnd your portfolio overnight just got chopped in half because the markets went down right and you're just you know the thing it's a short term volatility and usually you know in in oh seven or eight when the market corrected\nThat was it all happened within six months and that was considered a short term volatility but he was a major market correction and if you know anyone that's retired I'm In their retirement no seven away\nAnd if you're thinking about retirement and you're not really thinking about rescue should have a conversation with one of these folks that were affected by this and you probably know them and\nWhat happened there was if they were taking money out out of their investment account for the IRA count as it's chopped in half because markets went down\nAnd it took him seven years to get back to where they were but if you're drawing against it\nYou will never recover that money and there's a great chance that you will run out of money a lot sooner and bluntly speaking I made this wrecking ball we always talked about pendulum you know when the market's going one way it's beautiful you know everybody's smiling and laughing and will\nSwing vent vigils strings the other one is a wrecking ball you know to do a portfolio and you know like Stewart was a part of the of mortgage company and you know what was your toddler more movies banker or else the mortgage banker lightest first magazine the financial and yeah\nThe company went out of business right behind it and that happened to to a lot of folks I mean companies that were highly leveraged didn't up again plan a for for long term issues and and that's what happened with them\nAnd you know and the thing is that most people\nHave to have a significant um analysis that she has the analysis done to understand what kind of risk they can actually afford to take right and you know we we do run into a lot of people that say well you know I have bombs from my portfolio that's safe\nI don't know how to answer this question but I always say you don't want to call people that own the LA county bonds\nReds would last for they went bankrupt right or somebody choice right and you know I mean you can go down the line and you know the end depending on what kind of\nBombs you're buying but you know I mean there's still a significant risk associated with it the other thing we also look at uh when we talk about the risks portion of it is that uh the fed has been talking about they're going to raise the interest rate\nAnd what happens in bonds that most people don't think about they think most people are taught wrong but they are taught that stock market and bond market work against each other meaning that the stocks are up the bombs are going to be down and bonds are up the stocks are going to be down well that is not true\nWhat effects the bond market is the interest rate in the interest rate is going up the bonds are going to go down in value and it you know if the interest rate goes down the bombs go up in the ice if you just mentally see a seesaw\nAnd if you put bombs on one side and you put the interest rate on the other side and if one thing goes up the other one's going to go down so you just keep that in mind so you know we always talk about creating safe strategies in retirement so\nAnd they have in the right kind of product or to help balance out\nThe risk against the safety\nThat idea nudey would be the safe component that is correct but a lot of times what the advisors are doing is that they have their clients' money in the market and they sold client a annuity variable annuity just to generate additional revenues for their from other company\nAnd it's a it's a revenue approach it wasn't a holistic approach to planning\nAnd so that's one side of it right so let's talk about the the kind of annuities that we feel good about and we like\nAnd those are called fiction nobody's right now fixed or nudity is not going to make you rich if you think you're buying a fixed annuity because you're going to end up with double your money in five years it\nAin't happening right now I'm looking at a guaranteed right of return and how right that is right in in the idea behind that was really used to you know\nThe new to the ... are designed not to make you rich but it's actually design from keeping you from becoming poor right and so within a fixed uh nudey a family\nThey have one called indexed\nSo it's got fixed indexed annuity and the fix component means that your principal is not going to go down and index so everybody's heard about index funds would index funds students mimic the stock market and\nThe U.S will be five hundred the Dow Jones industrial average or you could have been asked to actually get a real civil and thousand two thousand three thousand I mean she was going right\nThere's a whole list of things you could index and so forth so these annuities actually have where you are right of return on your fix nudity is linked\nTo the performance of an index and you're not going to make as much money as the index and you'll never make as much money as the index but what happens is that when indices go down\nYour money doesn't go down so if you take say I'm just using it as an example that a hundred\nThousand dollars in let's say you make five thousand dollars in interest on that now that hundred and five thousand dollars with the fixed annuity becomes part of your principal meaning it's locked in it doesn't ever go backwards stock market goes down fifty percent just what you get a big fat zero\nFor returns and distill it the one oh five now still at one of five right in the markets come up that one of five will go up to whatever the next you know growth numbers for any luck itself but you know the thing is that you give up some of the upside gain\nTo have what's very important which is downside protection because the bombs don't do that the stocks don't do that the mutual funds to undo that exchange traded funds don't do it and the variable annuities don't do that\nThe real life you know the actual value of your portfolio will go down and most of this all almost all of those products\nExcept for the fixed annuity that peace of mind offering protection of your nest egg right and so if you just joined us you know we just talked about variable annuities\nAnd we do what's called a new day now says so few ... and you have questions about\nFees and concerns and interests that you might be taking with that give us a call and also we have a gift if you're listening to the show and I have a book uh I've about ten or ...

year oh our a financial dot com or the number to call you have questions about the end of the things you've been talking about today nine to\nRate here cheesecake eighty two fifty five that's Ninety rate sex talk\nAnd they tell me a little bit about risk management how do we now if we have the right amount of risk\nSo for starters you know what we talk about his rule of one hundred so some people have heard it and you know we've talked about this on the show in the past but if you took one hundred\nAnd if you subtract your age from that so assuming that let's say somebody sixty years of age ... subtract sixty from one hundred answers forty and what that means is a forty percent\nOf your investment portfolios should be associated with risk and sixty percent of your money should\nBe somewhere safe and you know we talked earlier that you know people have the false sense of security when they own bonds or you know even they own variable annuities that have income riders and things of that nature and those things I consider those false sense of security because we were looking for is what is your\nReal dollar war not an income writer but real dollar and so in this case where we talked about is if you were to take sixty percent of your uh investment or you know sixty percent of your account value and that should be somewhere safe\nAnd you know you could put that in CDs money market accounts but what do they pay today do you know now and I\nAlmost nothing nothing right it almost so what happens there is that if it even if paid one percent does matter but the thing is that you're going broke\nVery safely and you don't realize that you're going broke right because your money's not keeping up with inflation so you need your money working to or at least keeps up with inflation that means you're seeing even Stephen\nBut we're we're focusing on is actually growing it a little bit more than that so that you always have the growth factors associated with it especially as your expenses\nGo up you actually do better than in places where I could because as your expenses go up your best hope caustic cetera\nIf most people don't realize but their pension you know people were thinking that far ahead but they you know oh they're so worried about retiring and having enough money when they retire\nThey don't realize that the cost of living adjustments like you were you when you were working and you got a two percent pay increase or for three or four whatever or some of the some of you listening gold\nMine for hasn't given me a raise in five years you know because I mean there are some people that just a you know aren't structured that way but most most times when people are working\nTheir cost of living adjustment as a as their income goes up every single year\nBut what happens in this case is that most pensions\nDo not have it cost of living adjustments so today you know the milk like we talked about in the past were laughing about um you were on the show but we had talked about you are when I first started driving you know gas prices were like eighty nine cents a gallon and\nI remember that you do write up under a hundred dollar hundred dollar right and so by\nThe time I actually graduated high school\nOr the prices have actually gone up over like Donald Thirteen or so and you're you know what I mean today if you look at it it's you know whatever the price I Love to have those kind of gas prices right [laughter] yeah that'd be fun [laughter] but that was inflation right and today I just just ordinary were just talking to a client of ours\nAnd they ended up buying a new vehicle and I asked him I said would you pay for the vehicle and and they told me the number and I said do you realize that your parents first house\nWill cost less than what you pay for your vehicle today right and they're like that is so true you know that is so true and so you know we're looking for understanding how the inflation is going to impact\nYou
