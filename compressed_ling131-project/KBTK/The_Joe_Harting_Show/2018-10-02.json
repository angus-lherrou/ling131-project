credible\nBrett Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh said something about his drinking days that's inaccurate he's toast\nHe's denied the Supreme Court glad that about right\nNow let's go through the prosecutors memo like Sherman through Atlanta just stick with me no science Elana\nGeorge Dr Ford is not offered it consistent account of when the alleged assault occurred in July six text of the Washington Post she said it happened in the mid eighties\nEntered July thirty letter does Senator Feinstein she said it happened in the early eighties or August seventh statement to the ... river said that it happened one high school summer in the early eighties but you cross that the word early for reason she done did not explain\nThis is because the lawyers get a hold of her you see and they're trying to make sure everything's consisted in order to get Kavanaugh\nSeptember sixteen Washington Post article reporter that Dr Ford said it happened in the summer of Nineteen eighty to notice July six mid eighties July thirty early eighties\nAugust seven early eighties but then crosses out early but September sixteen when she's being a lawyer the summer of Nineteen eighty two wow she not only remembers the year but she remembers the season\n\nSimilarly the September sixteen auto reported that notes from an individual therapy session and twenty Thirteen show her describing the assault as occurring in their late teens\nBut she told the post and the committee that she was Fifteen when the assault allegedly occurred she's not turned over her therapy records for the committee to review and yet ladies and gentlemen she's wave any privilege he has one of those records because she either gave them to read them to the Washington Post there is no more attorney client privilege\nBut she's withholding why\nWell it is common for victims to be uncertain about dates Dr Ford failed to explain how she was suddenly able to narrow the timeframe to a particular season any particular year\n\nWell let's say the shoe was on the other foot and it was Kavanaugh would they tolerate that and say why he's credible no they wouldn't this is a big\nDeal ladies and gentleman early eighties mid eighties early teens late teens\nThat's my memory loss\nDr Ford has struggled to identify judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name NO NAME was given at her twenty twelve marriage therapy notes NO NAME was given in her twenties Thirteen individual therapy notes\nWhy not\nDr Ford has been claims to recall that she identified judge Kavanaugh by name and twenty twelve by the way before I read on that's her husband ... irrelevant\nAt that point judge Kavanaugh's name was widely reported in the press has a potential Supreme Court nominee if Governor Romney won the presidential election in any event it took Dr Ford over Thirty years the name or a sailing delayed disclosure of abuses common so this is not dispositive\nShe writes she's nicer than I Am\nWhen speaking with her husband Dr Ford changed her description of the incident to become less specific\nDr Ford testify but she told her husband about a quote unquote sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post that she informed her husband that she was the victim of a physical abuse at the beginning of their marriage she testified that both time she was referring to the same incident\nDr Ford has no memory\nOf key details or the night in question details that could help corroborate her account we talked about this last week\nThe memory to me it's quite selective specific details specific details that are most harmful to Kavanaugh no details at all oh cooperation\nShe does not remember who invited her to the party or how she even heard about it she just not remember how she got to the party she does not remember in what House the assault allegedly took place\nAware of that house was located with any specificity perhaps most importantly she does not remember how she got from the party back to her house\nHer inability to remember this detail racist significant questions\nShe told the Washington Post the party took place near the Columbia Country club the club is more than seven miles from her childhood home as the crow flies and she testified it was roughly a twenty minute drive from a childhood home\nShe also a great for the first time in her testimony that she was driven somewhere that night either to the party or from the party or both but you couldn't remember\n\nDr Ford was able to describe hiding in the bathroom locking the door and subsequently excelling excelling the house she also has also described wanting to make sure that she did not look like she'd been attacked\nBut she has no memory of who drove over or when nor has anyone come forward to identify him or herself as the driver no one\nGiven this all took place before cellphones arranging a ride home would not have been easy indeed she stated that she ran out of the house after coming downstairs and did not state that she made a phone call from the house before she did but that she called anyone else there after\nThat's convenient because then they can't look at phone records\nShe does however remember a small distinct details from the party unrelated to the assault for example she testified that she had exactly one beer at the party was taking no medication at that time of the alleged\nAssault and I will continue this after the break but as I said last week during the course of this questioning by this prosecutor it was devastating and\nThen we have the experts judicial analysts and a host the other one is she doing what is she doing she's growing up I thought I mean this doesn't mean anything to the American means everything\nEverything as it did you\nListening to these more on after she testified said Kavanaugh son he comes up is not done then they tell you this woman's incompetent and confident she so not confident\n\n\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops ... some experts say another crashes coming what will be left of your investments for your children are your grandchildren were\nAccording to her letter that Senator Feinstein Dr Ford heard judge Kavanaugh and mark judge talking to other party goes downstairs well\nShe was hiding in the bathroom after the alleged assault but according to her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone so in her letter the Feinstein she heard them talking to others\nIn her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone\nIn her letter she stated I lock the door behind me both loudly stumbled down the stairwell at which point other persons of the house we're talking with\nThem quote unquote\nBut she testified that Dr ... excuse me the judge Kavanaugh or mark judge turned up the music in the bedroom so that the people there's could not hear her scream\n\nShe testified that after the incident she ran into the bathroom lock the door and heard them going downstairs but she maintain that she could not hear the conversation with others when they got downstairs instead she testified that she assumed that conversation took place\n\nNoticed she never said she turned down the music either that any of them turned on the music\nHer account of who was that the party has been inconsistent according to the Washington Post accounted for therapy notes\nThere were four boys in the bedroom and what she was assaulted she told the Washington Post that the notes were erroneous because there were four boys at the party but only two in the bedroom interlocutors Senator Feinstein she said me and for others were present at the party\nEntered testimony she said there were four boys and additionally ling Kaiser and herself she could not remember the name of the fourth boy and no one has come forward Dr Ford listed Patrick PJ ...\nAs a bystander quote unquote in her statement to the political refer and enter July sixth tax to the Washington Post although she testified that it was an accurate to call him a bystander she did not lifts legal in Kaiser even though they are good friends leave link Kaiser's presidents should have been more memorable than PJ ...\n\nDr Ford has struggled to recall important recent events relating to her allegations in her testimony regarding recent events raises further questions about our memory raises further questions about her credibility because we're talking about things that are recent a few months ago not thirty six years ago\nDr Ford struggled to remember her interactions with the Washington Post\nDr Ford cannot remember she showed a full or partial set of therapy notes to the Washington Post reporter she does not remember whether she showed the post reporter\nThe actual therapists notes her own summary of those notes the Washington Post article that portions of her therapist notes were provided by Ford and reviewed by the post but in her testimony doctor for it cannot recall whether she summarize the nose for the reporter or showed her the actual records\nActually was even more and I took notes during the testimony to\nShe thought she may have summarized them over the phone or couldn't remember whether she physically handed in anything over I mean it was really preposterous we're talking about July, July ...\n\nShe does not remember if she actually had a copy of the notes when she text of the Washington Post ... account on July six Dr Ford set in their first what's a message to the post that she quote\nAt therapy notes talking about unquote the incident when she contacted the post tip line\nShe testified she'd reviewed a therapy noticed before a contact that oppose to determine whether the ... whether they mentioned anything about the alleged since then but could not remember if she had a copy of these notes and she said in her ... message or merely review them inner therapists off and on wait a minute\nSo she couldn't remember on July sixth if she had a copy downloaded a copy of her therapist notes or had reviewed them in her therapist's office does anyone believe that\n\nShe's providing information to the Washington Post and she can't remember\nA few months ago if she downloaded them from the Internet or if she had reviewed them in her therapist's office\n\nCan you imagine if Kavanaugh said this about drinking back in high school I Can't remember if a gay but\nDrinking at night I don't remember if I had three cans or six I don't remember too are far and we can you hear me saying and I learned a lot of big thing so I Would ask call me and I would ask Blumenthal Mr Vietnam vet not I would ask\nHim is a little lie\nWhat does that evidence they say more lies\nLadies and gentlemen I'm here to tell you this is not a memory Asia this was an attempt by her lawyers and I think her now to put a round peg in a square hole or square peg in a round hole you get the point\nIt makes no sense this was July sixth wasn't thirty six years ago wasn't even six months ago\n\nDr Ford refused to provide any of our therapy notes that the committee and that is outrageous they should be subpoenaed she waived her privileged on these therapy notes\nDr forwards explanation 'em by the way I'm sure Shelley White House Sally Whitehouse of Rhode Island's goes what are we supposed to do\nRely on a ladder can't rely\nThat's all true where they actually\nBy God\nDo I have another drink wait a minute not in the public\nFord's explanation of why she disclosed her allegations the way she did raises questions\nShe claimed originally that she wished for her story to remain confidential but the person operating the tip line at the Washington Post's was the first person other than her therapist or a husband to whom she disclose the identity of her alleged attacker she testified that she had a sense of urgency to relate the information to the Senate and the president quote unquote\nBecause she claimed she quote did not know how to do that unquote it's very hard\nTo contact the Senate\nYou could what we called Google you could call what we could bang you could what we call call even for one the one you could call or asked one of the people on the beach who you consulted apparently frequently or millions of people contact the Senate every\nEvery year we have our living surges diet and Google and phone number for the Senate tried there she did not\nContact the Senate didn't\nShe did not explain why she knew how to contact her congresswoman but not a senator\nDr Ford cannot remember she was being audio or video recorded when she took the polygraph she could not remember whether the polygraph occurred the same day as a grandmother's funeral the day after her grandmother's funeral\nAgain these are all recent what also been inappropriate to administer polygraph to someone who was grieving says the prosecutor Dr forge description of the physiological impact of the event raise this question\nSays the prosecutor she maintains that she suffers from anxiety claustrophobia post traumatic stress disorder PATS the the data the hearing was delayed because of the committee was informed that her symptoms prevent her from flying but\nShe agreed during her testimony that she flies quote fairly frequently for her hobbies and work unquote she flies to the mid Atlantic at least once a year to visit her family she's flown to Hawaii French Polynesia Costa Rica just flew to Washington DC for the hearing\nNo to that her attorneys refused a private hearing or interview Dr Ford testified that she was not clear whether investigators were willing to travel to California interviewer it therefore is not clear that her attorneys ever communicated chairman Grassley has offered to send investigators the meter and California or\nWherever she wanted to meet to conduct the interview\nWe pointed all these points out they're important she alleges that she struggled academically in college but she's never made any similar claim about her two years of high school\nIt's significant that she used the word contributed contributed\nWhen she described the ... the psychological impact of the incident or the Washington Post uses the word contributed rather than cars suggests that other life events may contribute to her symptoms and one question on that point said that she could think of nothing as striking as the alleged assault\nOther words she wouldn't add to it\nAnd the prosecutor ads the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr Ford's attorney is likely affect the doctor for a cap and she attached a
