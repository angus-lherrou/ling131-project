so we'll bring them back to talk a bit of a Dan former Secret Service former NYPD nobody better to talk about this than anybody else you've been watching the coverage what do you make of this\nOr mark it seems like a very amateurish operation I mean just look at some of the hallmarks of these devices that were sent I mean number one is the obvious one Mark I'm none of them thank God I'm actually detonated in ... and exploded again thank the lord that happened\nUm but certainly not the hallmarks of of of someone with experience in this in this space but other things as Well Mark which seemed to indicate one of only two possible options it was either a really amateurish operation or someone seemingly wanted to get caught\nUm outside of the not detonating also when you look at the photographs we've seen of the devices mark\nYou see just hallmarks of of of of just a rookie type behavior like excessive postage which is all I mean it's all over the front of you see the be pronounced hype\nOn the on the label you know if you're trying to secrete a device into a mail system to God Forbid detonate in front of a male hands or the target\nYou don't use height that's going to draw attention to the package you see the um one other thing mark they had uh one of the packages was addressed the John Brennan at CNN well\nI mean John Brennan doesn't work at the end and that's quite obvious the basic Internet search would have produced that information you worked at NBC which I mean this is ... it's really a there's something not right here it's a very suspicious operation very amateurish right now\nLet me ask you this question is it possible he has such a a devious minded worked at somebody wanted to look\nSo amateurish\nWell it's certainly possible I said there's only one of two scenarios here I mean either somebody wanted to get caught um for some reason or it's so amateurish that it's\nIt it it speaks to some kind of a motive we haven't yet it's just bizarre\nAnd then that the the selection of the of the targets um you know of course there's people want to you know I've just people all over the media right now are given out these ... especially if you go on somebody's other networks who are desperate to prescribe a motive to this we have no idea\nBut I Would encourage all of them they take this very very slow or because I when I when I see mark in my

imagines\nA\nScenario so you would just try and get the evidence and follow the evidence and trying to figure it out that way rather than while this mode of that motive and the other modem you really you you're just getting down to the forensics\nYeah and that's what guys like you when I Do\nUh we're always hesitant to jump to a motive before we actually have the facts and the data there I mean this is with comments that reasonable people do but of course when you know with the with the current environment and and the media hysteria they immediately want to prescribe them a motive remembered mark\nThe most important of all the W. using this right the who what when where why and how\nThe most important thing obviously is who did who the actual person we'd have no we have zero clues right

going to hit this very very importantly in the next few minutes go ahead\nWe know this president is\nWell I just want to be precise a congressman you're making comparison between the program the United states and Hitler and I want you to explain exactly what you mean 'cause obviously this is a this is controversial\nWell what I'm saying is that using the word of nationalism in a naturalist meaning that you know when you listen to Hitler he was talking about German from the germ is uh and that's it I'm\nOn\nAnd Franklin Roosevelt was looking at America for the Americans\n\nThese are historically illiterate human beings that we have to listen to these not alone Max Boot on CNN yesterday cut Eighteen go\nDisturbing historical echoes somebody well\nNow nationalism has meant a lot of things over the years and in the nineteenth century it was primarily associated with liberal movements people I feed her heart so the founder of ... who helped to create the state or federal air\nBoulevard who helped to create the state's Colombian Venezuela but on the twentieth century nationalism is taken on a much darker much more negative connotation bingo socially of essentially a fascist movements\nAnd you think of nationalist who think that people I'd Franco and Mussolini and Hitler and Pinochet where we are not exactly people at the president of the United states which I Believe you have your wedding and that's why it's very hard for me to think of people and he was history called describe themselves as nationalist this is not a popular term\nOkay okay well I'll explain one very big one who was on the twentieth century in a moment and we have Joe Scarborough really low some really low some individual ... Nineteen do want to read this this is\nThis is this referencing nobody\nRight so please please my my blood viewers out there do not\nDo not draw parallels between what is said here and anybody\nSo he's doing this to attack Trump and he thinks he covered by saying don't draw apparently well why else would he be doing just to give us a history lesson on Hitler go ahead I think that would hurt me\nFor me very deeply and you don't want to hurt me deeply I don't want to leave on the shows\nThis fish doesn't relate to anybody whatsoever it's just [noise]\nI was going through rains and rains and volumes I Love World War two and ... they are being Churchill fan love what Rosa\nSo I was reading this this is\nFrom um ah the United states has a strategic services and describe\nHe just happened to come across as late as Jim because when you think Joe Scarborough you think of a historian particularly when it comes to World War two don't you nobody sent this to him or put it under his rather huge\nBubble snows no no he found this on his own go ahead\nFile and this only pertains Adolf Hitler came and nobody else I can I just can't say that enough is enough for this is what they had for Adolf Hitler's psychological profile and for those of you in the midst of\nReading World War two\nA government reports you'll find that fascinating is primary rules were never allowed the public to cool off\nNever admit a fault or wrong\nNever seen that there may be some good and your enemy never leave room for alternatives never accept blame\nOn one enemy at a time and blame them for everything that goes wrong people will believe a big lie sooner than the little one\nAnd if you paid it free kind that you know so there you have ... comparing Trump the Hitler even though he denies that that's the entire purpose of this and Don Lemon on CNN cut twenty go wow\nI'm a nationalist\nUse that word we're going to talk about that word tonight it is a favorite of All right and is loaded with native is and racial undertones and global as well global is I've been uses a slur\nOf sorts sometimes even against those in the administration often with anti Semitic overtone\nOkay now keep in mind he's or media figures\nThese are hosts some claimed to be reporters\nAnd listen to how they talk is this cooling down the rhetoric\nSome claim to be reporters\nAnd listen to how they talk is this cooling down the rhetoric is is bringing the country to get is this news is it even news at all\nThen there's Peter Alexander White House correspondent on MSNBC um getting somewhere with this folks please stick with me I Can't do this stuff and quick soundbite cut Twenty one do\nYou have to also about his using the word nationalist saying you know out loud I Am a national and how does the president kind of conceive of that term because it does in many ways have racial under house\nRacial undertones racial overtones the word nationalist\nGo ahead\nOr does that not just racial that there's enough over 'cause this is something that the president and sort of shied away from in the past obviously nationalism was a phrase that Steve Bannon a obviously embrace over the course of the campaign and a lot of the presence of all is trying to pay them pay you get the draft and there's many others\nSo yesterday\nTrump as compared to Hitler he's a racist he's ... he's all these things\n\nAll these this is the media or the media using selectively guests to say these things they know what they're going to say\nThe media\nAnd tonight they're out there saying toned down politics as divisive it's to hear now they're reporting\nAnd they're not really reporting slowly but surely you're aiming at Trump\nI'm not a national is ladies and gentlemen I'm a constitutional is I Believe in Americanism not nationalism\nIn the correct Max Boot and everybody else who heard speaking one of the leading progressive or the last century progressive he ran as a\nThird party candidate is the head of the progressive party was Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd on August thirty one Nineteen ten those of us who actually do study history Scarborough\nHe gave a famous famous speech you know what he in titled or speak the new national is\nThe new nationalism\nAnd in this speech the new nationalism Theodore Roosevelt borrowed\nFrom a gentleman by the name are Herbert cruelly if you have my book rediscovering Americanism you know what I'm Talking about\nHis his essay was famous essay\nIn something called the outlook magazine promise of American Life this had an enormous influence on Theodore Roosevelt\n\nThe progressive movement was really borne out of the Republican Party early on\nAnd it's great leader would become Theodore Roosevelt\n\nAnd then there's new nationalism speech I said he called it his new nationalism speech he spoke about the new nationalism the object of a central government\nThe need for a ubiquitous federal government they need to be interfering in the private sector\nA rejection of market capitalism in many respects a rejection of the ... I'm telling you the truth I rejection of the declaration of independence has written a rejection of the separation of powers that couldn't finds the ability the federal government to help people\n\nAnd it was on the on the left on the progressive left their new nationalism\n\nSo\nWhy do these people in the media compare Trump to Hitler why do they call him a racist when he uses the word nationalist the criticism should be that's a progressive term that progressive own that\nIn the twentieth century\n\nBut Don Lemon is a moron Joe Scarborough is a moron Max Boot as a fake Gregory
