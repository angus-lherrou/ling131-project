I agree there should be much stronger um consequences for for people that are continually breaking the law\nHowever I'm basically I'm trying to prevent people from breaking the law that haven't yet is it just the dangerous um it it it cuts away at the freedom of the society that\nWho suggested that\nI never said that I never said go go and stop people who've never broken the law firm breaking the law I mean I've never broken the law I'm guessing that you have an either not to that level as I've gotten a speeding ticket\nBut no I I'm with you I don't want us to be a Minority Report I just gave you thirty or forty or fifty different times this guy should have had a criminal record and he didn't have a criminal record because of a stupid Obama program called the promise program\nA it's a ... for me this guy has a criminal record and this is the fact he would not have been able to buy buy the gun\nFrom me have you on campus resource officer pulled his gun gone in and tried to stop him maybe he doesn't kill Seventeen people there were several things that could have done\nBefore he ever got to that school that day that's what I'm saying I'm not seeing torture was who was going to be a killer return it was who was going to be a bad guy what I'm saying is if somebody has shown himself to be a bad guy we use the society should take action oh\nYes yes I agree but I'm Talking more along the lines of um of like um where everybody has to be checked in to the synagogue or whatever where where you have to basically for your your identity that come to your synagogue um you know it just seems like we're\nGoing with time ago where I was a backward\nOr just because of the fact that freedom there's a certain amount of risk that has to be taken so if if you're free to walk in and out of your synagogue yes there is a risk their however there's thousands of other synagogue that haven't been shot today\nRight oh so so so ... no big deal that eight people died at one synagogue everybody else's seeds everywhere else\nWell guess what I'm saying is um [noise] there's a certain amount of risk and the freedom\nTo move freely like that and and it it's it's sad and there's got to be a way to the limit the shootings however\nI well we we we don't we don't have unlimited freedom in\nThe ... we don't I mean we don't have the energy we actually have a government you know body\nAnd we have police officers that pleasing than protecting served\nThere's a reason for that because there were laws I mean you realize that the fact that we have laws means that we don't have\nUnlimited freedom right we don't have freedom go kill somebody will have reason to go deal drug delivery them to go I mean still in the blink bad thing that you can do we don't have freedom to do all those things because there are laws in a in a civilized society so if it takes me an extra two seconds to get into the synagogue or into the church\nTo ensure that the guy with a gun can't get in I'm okay with that I'm Still free to go to my synagogue could just take two seconds longer so what\nSure yeah I Know we we only have the freedom to do or what society decides we have the freedom to do you know through law but I I just I guess my point is that I I feel I I that's just moving towards\nUm that it's okay to limit everybody for the state of catching one well\nHow are we limiting everybody you know when you get on a plane are you happy that people are going through a checkpoint or not\nWell I guess uh well yes or no I mean it's a simple question no I I don't like it was not that long ago and there were still\nThere and what would you like for the TSA to go away we have nobody checking anybody anybody can walk in with anything they want\nYou're going to think I'm nuts but yes um it\nWas another I I Do the job I Love your like a brother but your nose going up all over the line now one eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty Joe packs dot com timid here [noise]\n\n[noise]\nSixteen roles for alerts in office the automatic tax message Mr Tanner which may apply\nYour jaw I Want to come on but I only been up two minutes and you were like you you're you're breaking pencils him going crazy with a with a all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow\nAnd all of us every American who pays taxes got a break every American to pay taxes as a bigger paychecks many American three four five six million either got bonuses when they got raises companies or or no manufacturing stuff here again or promising to start doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that success says\nThat we got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations are going to drive them out of the country how was that a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so repealing the tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas or manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and in in in a period where President Obama\nYou know that was the weakest economic recovery um since World War two right and he never had a year never had a year he broke three percent um uh for the entire year here because of an more good news again this morning in the third quarter that three and a half percent growth beat\nThe predictions ... down very strong consumer confidence and what that means\nIs America's growth will end up above three percent this year just blowing past all the protections before our new tax code and tax cuts so the tax law this new tax law is working for millions of Americans\nIt really is a ... and also by the way of getting rid of the individual mandate helped out a bit of an eighty percent you're only talking about his eighty percent of those who are taxed\nBecause of the individual mandate we're we're in the middle class or lower middle class area they'll get a tax break when that went away Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair of the president last week or a few days ago said I\nGot another big tax cut coming going to go to middle class families is going to be a big tax cuts it's coming it's on the way you and I have talked about two point oh what does this look like you can you let us get a little bit yeah so\nIt's really this was a little ... to put in a two point oh it was really about you know tax forms about changing the trajectory of the economy and putting America back into the lead role\nThat succeeded two point oh it was about changing the culture in Washington so that every year we make the tax code better they are more competitive so that means prominence for families and small businesses that that's fair that their tax cuts are made permanent plus crates another million and a half new jobs\nThe second part of the people when I was about to savings helping families\nSay more in earlier for their life really important the third is about helping start up businesses in innovation\nBack to America that's two point oh it's passed the house already and actually even picked up forty four democratic votes in the process but this president wants to go\nBeyond that like Ronald Reagan just as you enter as you said earlier who really unleash prosperity with the series of tax cuts President Trump wants us\nTo ah to advance in path at ten percent a cut focused on the middle class and here's his thinking look the middle class you know they make too much money to get all the government help they don't make enough\nTo really um live comfortably\nWhile you're always the ones getting squeezed to his point is can't we do more for them and my answer is yes we can\nAnd so uh in what a contrast think about this so the Democrats want to repeal the tax cuts and a new report by Heritage Foundation says that will cost each middle class American uh\nTwenty seven thousand dollars in an extra taxes and lost wages so contrast that ... every everyone in America right at twenty seven thousand dollar check to was you know you don't have versus a president who wants\nMore tax relief for middle class families is there is there a clear contrast between that\nWhat it could not be more clear as Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair he's a Republican district date the racing to Texas from the would lose it was interesting about it you use\nThe sales job on the left is if you Brady and you'd Trump do this and if the Republicans do this it's going to hurt the deficit exponentially ... years they ignore the deficit I mean the bronco Obama doubled the deficit by ruining the economy in\nIn in by the way President Obama and Democrats they added two trillion dollars\nTo the national debt in one year young one you were taking less than that over a decade and we invest it in a brand new tax code in in tax relief for families and small businesses in a redesign so that American companies can compete and win anywhere in the world it's very modest and smart investment and by the way\nWhat what the liberals won't tell you is our federal revenue in the washed and hit a record high this year\nWe actually have more revenue for individuals and payroll taxes a hundred and five billion\nThan we did before tax reform in so look we won't know for many many years whether the the new um tax code has actually fully paid for itself what we do know is is that new revenues are coming in into or the federal government\nThat our economic growth and opportunities is helping every American and I always feel like to point this out\nThe difference you if you if you're worried about this Washington have enough money\nThe difference between that really slow Obama less than two percent growth and the three percent growth sings President Trump and more is forty four trillion dollars in extra federal revenue\nWhen we are growing the economy you know so I'm I'm convinced that if we hadn't you know had tax reform our deficits would have been much greater overtime\nThey haven't already House Ways and Means Committee chair but when can this go into place the president has has said it's going to be first week of November it sounds like it might happen the day or two before the election what's going to have a\nDeath so probably ... here's what we're talking about before you went onstage about when we might introduce it when he might bring the resolution to the floor and we're talking about could we do it in the next few weeks but in truth what he wants us to do is to have this ten percent middle class cut ready for him and when Republican\nThe next few weeks but in truth what he wants us to do\nIs to have this ten percent middle class cut ready for him and when Republicans hold the house and Senate ... introduce it in the new um a Congress and pass it than his point is let's make sure every American understands only one party is fighting for their pocketbook\nI can talk to you for three hours let me let me grab one more quick question will let you go Kevin always appreciate the access became ... we always appreciate it All right so the terms you just talked to a you just did tomatoes\nThat house or the Senate looks to me and again people have to stay engaged in our society has to go out and vote and I sit in their hands would be happy that the paycheck is bigger do insure that it's going to stay that way go and vote but it seems to me that two maybe three some say four seats could be gained in the Senate but the house is still a toss up ... the Democrats are backing off of that whole blue\nWave big and actually what what did you tell me before we started the interview they're actually saying we're not watching the numbers by yes they are with that but it's actually an actor you see their voting rights\nAnd any watch how Senator Cruz has really kicked it back into gear and Rick sort of feel that pulled the curtain back on that or if you're out more taxes realized just how extremely liberal he is always\nFar left yeah I'm so guys basically as a Bernie socialist guy would open borders and ... and and the fact he actually said Kevin not too long ago that we that we recently took capital Mexico we just took a yeah a couple of years the\nGuy who voted against repeatedly the hurricane Harvey disaster relief right it so much of our state was desperately waiting for I Am and I read his excuses about say there is no excuse\nOr is it for for now he'll want to work at ... he wanted some something unrelated attached to it or else he wouldn't do it and you're right thank goodness we have the majority because this would not pass intended bunch of people like Ted\nCruz lead and I'll tell you wish you could be me joke 'cause\n'cause 'cause Senator Cruz\nA was was hugely helpful and important on tax reform on Hurricane Harvey relief in right at your mandate\nSo I'll just tell you he is delivering for Texas in a big way and I think look in the house we have our backs to the wall street says we don't uh keep the house a lot of tough races in the day I Believe we do because because Republicans and conservatives\nAre now turning out and understand this is not a mid term this is really about you know keeping this house the Senate this economy this president in\nPlace it's our house ways and Means Committee chair Kevin Brady district every boat to the great state of Texas Kevin my right to appreciate the time was taught to thanks to take care okay\nWe always appreciate the house ways and Means Committee chair stopping by such an important job and uh it's really great news to hear that it looks like there's going to be another tax cuts for middle class families and they're looking at cutting your taxes by ten percent holy mackerel\nOr where'd you go
