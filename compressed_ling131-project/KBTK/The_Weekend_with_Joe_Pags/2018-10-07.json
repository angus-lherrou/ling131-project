how to choose to catch up with the president's son\nEarlier this week and we mainly focused on the germ real so focused on the economy we talked about the cabinet ... certainly a much more it is a Donald Trump junior done I appreciate your how are you\nI'm doing well Joe how about yourself I mean I'm doing great really really great to talk to you got like a witness nothing we've got to get to I just start with would really make sense to me and I started\nThis way with a recorded interview to who you know seven times or something you have actually been to the White House do to your dad which was an incredible experience but I I just have to go back for a second marriage and the same question of you that I asked her dead why you guys you guys were the\nLast one of them that all the time\nIsn't it the first question that you have to say no I was I got to you guys love the country your father and his sacrifice so much for for the better of the country but maybe you guys had everything you could possibly ever want to use that question easy to it's not easy to answer ...\nTexas I mean just look at the economic success if it had to look at all the stats but you want to become California give me a\n... you know and people are going to tell them who you're bringing their politics but that doesn't make any sense to me it's a it's Donald Trump junior or do\nYou have an

why you have no idea but like I said\nWe're we're not in a fair fight you know the media will show this was All right thing to do it but I'm all for taking care of other people want to take care of our own problems you know\nWe've got plenty of friends who are going to disastrous education system where what twenty eight and the ... the world after a long list of third world country is that you and half of you know to spend on I have\nSpent the a small fraction of what we spend per capita right I mean we had we had that problem that we're working on fixing and they're making great progress with all of those things but like we need to keep going and you're going to have people in there that basically the next two years until twenty twenty you will be a total stalemate nothing will get down there will be a total disaster\nI Want to keep this winning going for another six years so we need people in the house my father can't do it by himself\nHe needs like Ted and these guys like so many of your congressman that are up to help him get these things done and to prevent these asinine policies of the laugh but we can't be complacent we can't sit back and say no no I Love what's going on this was great we got to get in there and fight because the other side is doing it and they don't fight fair as we've witnessed over the last two weeks\nI Would be remiss if I didn't very quickly ask you about Kavanaugh you see these these are these allegations of if you want to make decisions they're going to be completely speeches allegations their whole through all of it this way and it's just a bone from your your buddy you have an out of you know as soon as we obviously I'm completely changes your story but she told NBC the day before\nYou get to know penalty\nBecause she was a

political hit you it was so important\nIt was so important that Senator Feinstein sat on the allegations for two months before bringing it up if this doesn't read as a political hit job that's sort of the other day was killed or because I mean this is a scary scary precedent that you could ruin a guy\nAnd his life and by the way not just that he got a guy that's been through six FBI investigation right a guy that's been a public figure and guy that's been nominated to court after court after court you know and then all of a sudden now is the Supreme Court oh now we're coming up with this year then third accuser comes out I saw you know at first it was raped and it was getting ready to and it was cereal game right\nOr you know then it was well he's an alcoholic and he was a violent alcoholic he threw a beer once then it turns out he threw an ice cube\nLike give me a break attacks continue they keep going the other side fights it's not a it's a scary to me as a parent you know\nThey and they shouldn't be to anyone who's listening if you're a parent that someone could just to try to destroy in this case sons in life\nWith no fat no cooperation no memory no anything but we are to take that as gospel that's not how our system works notes no it only works that way if you're a liberal Democrat and and it works in their favor and the media ... their water and they keep going and it's a scary precedent\nBecause it means that no one is safe if this guy isn't safe no one is safe it's\nDonald Trump junior we appreciate the time of the ... really really strong I got to

here and if you're nice if you're lucky I'll give you Kellyanne Conway after the break I've got one minute for you they make it out but\nHey I was at a radio and the way mark how you got to abstain from voting for the capital that way\nThat doesn't make any sense of what is your ups the oh she's going to stay in other words you got to vote and they were right this way the Democrats will get that extra vote who said that\nWhat I heard about Fox News this morning\nI'll have to check that out of that is true that it's definitely a done deal because you hate to see Danes Mrs daughter's wedding I'll check it out I'll see if I could buy something on that\nAre very interesting take all of what you do what you would you buy obviously you want to be like to check all the news but I Will checked

tax message messed me applied\nIt's our tells the president killing in Conway kill you or do you think that\nThere should be committee investigation into Feinstein or whoever on her stuff leak that out to settle this for two months she could have talked to terminal directly when they met privately if you could have bought into the president's shoes you got the letter you're right she's not on it because you hope that they would be them down on the merits they couldn't the guy he's supremely\nQualified to be in this job is you're going to be an investigation should there be\nWell I saw some members say that they were going to investigate it I saw Senator Tom cotton last week or say that very thing that they should investigate the leak of the of the letter\nUh the other thing that's happening as Senator Hatch made reference I Believe it was yesterday Joe to the to the odd consequences that could follow to\nFord's lawyers who either\nNeglected to mention to her\nWhich was their their duty they mentioned it to for that she had an opportunity to testify under oath privately and in California well it ever happened to come to Washington either for lied under oath that she didn't know that or her lawyers failed to tell her and if the lord fair to tell us because there are no cameras and cleaned lights\nIn private testimony in California there's no Washington based\nObsessive media right to to to go and cover every jot until and a new client base for them afterward so that there are many things that could be investigated long after the vote for his confirmation happens\nIs the government is you're going to happen to your your bed is he's going to get confirmed Lindsey Graham says he's not re nominate him yes I did see that\nSo leader McConnell said he's he's ... he's going to have a vote and this man will be voted on the one I posted oppose him but have the guts to say why don't pretend it's about X Y and Z when you've already said you were going to pose any of Donald Trump's nominees from the beginning the other thing I wanted to mention is for all the talk about how energize\nThe liberals are and they're watching in suburban women I suburban women are smart enough to know that they are benefiting from an incredible economic boom market\nAnd that didn't happen by coincidence it happen through causation his name as Donald Trump even we haven't found one Democrat now who is trying to applaud the Trump ... his name is bronco bomb at President Obama's\nTried to take credit for it so he didn't get the talking points as Democrats but to say but the economy is not that great he's saying it's so great I'm taking credit for it but these suburban women also should look at this process and they should say I'm so much is going right but I also\nI also I'm so disgusted that people um heard this woman used it as a woman for their own political grandstanding purposes and the case of a few of them up there in the Senate Judiciary committee to actually raise money for their twenty twenty elections they injected politics and what should be a decidedly\nNon political process here\nAnd yes I think it will be investigated after the fact and and I think that people will be very upset about this for a long time to come to folks are watching and for all the talk about liberal excitement look at the ratings have the Fox news primetime lineup last Thursday after the testimony over five million per show that pizza that'd be the um\nThe daytime shows the morning shows for the networks want to you had us over three hundred thousand lakes of the ... to the president's tweet about Brett Kavanaugh just twenty four hours later\nThat's a very high number of like for a presidential tweet so people are energized or watching a lot of voters out there say they'll\n... they'll let this one slip through don't given to to the mob mentality of of the minority in the Senate who doesn't have enough votes to stop this man\nI I I Know you're going to go one last quick wouldn't wouldn't have been with Russian Kilian had anybody on the on the left on that panel the Judiciary Committee been questioned by somebody in the media once who wants to him if he comes back to re degree from his if you're just using you wanted will you vote for him ... when ... when I go to the Russian you\nAnd I had been posing that question hypothetically you're a great question right um and remember I Want to say something else so Ford and Kavanaugh under oath but none of the senators were\nThey just ask and say whatever the heck they want 'em but you're right what would change because they never thought look they never thought that\nAh that they said the Judiciary Committee would give for an opportunity to testify they did in fact they accommodated bent over backwards to accommodate her\nHer laundry list of demands a she testified ten days after she was eleven days after everybody found out who she is and that would be eleven days after Brett Kavanaugh was willing to testify number one number two and then they said well we have to do an FBI investigation it would only take four days\nBetween now and the day that there has to find so let's just do it they never thought the president would go ahead and author I did he authorized and saying well maybe she'll be longer are stronger deeper\nEyes not enough it'll never be enough for folks who aren't dealing honestly with ... with with why they oppose this man and his nomination to the United States Supreme court so you're right how many they will change their mind\nMaybe done but we're looking at some of those red state Democrats who need to exceed the will of their voters do right by the people who put them on the job or decide that they're going to be complicit in the process that is try to destroy us he lives in in in in the way\nIt's a little closer to kill you can wait till you're ... who's ... thank you Joe pack\nWe always appreciate having Jillian on your thoughts on what you just heard plus we've just when you travel phone calls here you know it's interesting because it was really due globalization as those who are opposing a terminal remember how this whole thing started\nThe whole thing started with room waiting and waiting and we can be said he was leaving and the west or we're going to oppose whoever you nominate which then they have these either paid or gender protesters as the Supreme Court waiting for the announcement but didn't know who the for front runners it would be\nSo they have links sons that were in protest the sons will want\nAnd they just building with a Sharpie after he made the announcement terminal some of the far left it might have been blamed it might have been somebody else sent out an email\nThat night\nHereby opposed and they literally had to watch if we go to bill in the the the nominee's name this was from the beginning use the ... that's all it was nothing more nothing was we're going to resist because Donald Trump doesn't get to put another another week or just as it was well guess what\nWell it was nothing more nothing less we're going to resist because Donald Trump doesn't get to put another another Supreme Court justice in place well guess what he did and and he's going to win this one\nI did look into it it's starting to be widely reported now that Lisa Murkowski is going to abstain she will vote president she won't vote yes or no on Kavanaugh she'll vote president so that um centered Danes of of a Montana to go to his daughter's wedding\nSo it looks like that's probably how it's going to go down instead of forty nine other does it's gonna be forty eight\nAnd I'm\n... and I guess it could have been forty nine forty nine with things gone so took it probably will be what forty nine forty eight\nSomething like that or fifty one forty nine what it'd be a hundred because he's not going to be there will be Ninety nine total votes so\nWe'll see how it shakes out\nBut the bottom line is it looks like she's going to have stayed just said president\nAnd that will that will clear the way for Brett Kavanaugh to be confirmed today unless something happens and again keep in mind that you're just joining us bishop my show is live\nFrom uh from New ... pm eastern time on Saturday and done nine AM to do them\nOn a on the summertime on Saturday So if you're hearing it later than that and he's already been confirmed or not confirmed I think it will be confirmed that's why we're talking about it and it happens already happened this radio station of course there's always going to keep
