M. C. A. United States and Mexico or Canada trades executive agreement makes total sense\nFor us to have done that we got a really not perfect listen uh you know I I I don't think I've ever negotiated deal while I was governor or otherwise that I Would call perfect but um this president understands how negotiate and the ... are\nNot um without their challenges a but negotiations are generally uncomfortable you know comfortable for both sides but a President Trump he'd get the man I'm so glad he's sitting at the table negotiating for us because America's went and uh I like when\nIt's all I Do too in the president's and we'll get tired of winning when I'm tired of it yet it is a former governor Rick Perry use the energy secretaries have United States of America you and I've known each other for more than a decade now if you can believe it\nAnd you've always told me that you believe wholeheartedly that we could export more oil than we import\nAnd people scoffed at that people left it but you also have said and I think we'll get there that we can be energy independent we're now exporting more than one importing you're not surprised by it um how did you make that happen how do we how do we as a country make that happen\nWell I Want to get the credit to where it's really do and that is to private sector innovators and technologies that are uh you know George Mitchell is a great example of the man who is really the father of hydraulic fracturing you know a lot of people told them it wouldn't work wouldn't work and he stayed with it stayed with it\nOr when you couple that with directional drilling and I might add some of that technology of directional drilling that made it possible uh and as he is and that they came up at at one of our a department of energy national labs to be able to allow the polycarbonate ... material to stay on the drill bit\nThat has so changed uh and being able to go in and horizontally drill a these are formations like the Bach enough in the north\nDakota or there was never really built if you will uh to drill horizontally but when you can or excuse me a vertical a but when you can go and drill it\nHorizontally it completely changes the world a ... and and the economic impact is stunning and I think that's the real story for America our best days are in front of us are the future of the oil and gas industry in America is stunningly power\nOr the jobs they get created the wealth that gets created take a look at the eagle Ford right there and you know south of San Antonio Rick how that change that entire region you go up to a North Dakota and those communities up there that are just booming\nOr the the limiting factor for them today is having the infrastructure in place that can handle the workers ah it's the welders it's the all of these really high paying jobs are being created in the energy sector all across the country in the Marcellus Shale up in Pennsylvania\nUh and and you want to see a junk to position cross that Pennsylvania New York line Pennsylvania it's it's forcing up and that oil and gas area where the Marcellus has been done\nCross the line into New York where their governor and their their government in Albany has a forbidden them to hydraulic like frack are used directional drilling and then um you know the economic uh a downturn there is palpable man it's it's it's sad that they don't see\nThat American energy and went on and I and American energy creating Ellen gee is watching driving down the missions\nThe emissions in America are down fourteen percent since two thousand steps you know these countries that were you know her rang in us about getting out of the Paris Agreement and and my response to them as listen\nWhen you show us that you're reducing your emissions you come and talk to us about signing on to some agreements\nI couldn't ...
