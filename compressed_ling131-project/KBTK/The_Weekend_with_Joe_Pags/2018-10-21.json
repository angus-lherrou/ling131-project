was really hard to raise money\nFor his movies we usually movie about what you touched you cold which is why when there was a big issue or at least I was a member of his biggest retailer one show so much trouble to make obviously a very interesting um ... million one story\nWell of the bottom line is that the a radical abortion is in the Democratic party and on the left\nI Do not want to acknowledge the horrors that are committed in the name of so called reproductive choice and my attachment to the movie into the story goes back to two thousand eleven when almost nobody else was paying attention to the story I and I first blogged about the grand jury report\n'em in the indictments against ... now who murdered multiple born alive babies as well as being responsible for the death of a woman in in his clinic\nI'm back in in twenty eleven and uh what was stunning about this grand jury report that was issued and you know Democrat liberal Philadelphia or was that they acknowledged that time and time and again government\nAgencies as well as women's advocates looked the other way at the blatant cereal crimes that were going on I'm at a centrally out in the open so when an ... and feel ...\nI decided that they were going to first write an investigative book about ah the crimes and then I'll turn them into a movie I volunteered to use my platform any way that I could to help them and initially they tried to crowdsource the movie on\nA Kickstarter and were kicked off by pro abortion sensors on that website they had to go to ... go go and I donated personally three times to the movie and so did many thousands and thousands of other small donors raising two point three million dollars to get this movie made and it\nEnded up in the top ten of movies this weekend despite a campaign to to shut up any kind of publicity for the movie\n... movie goes no trial he was showing the role of raising money on Facebook and how about advertising on on your I mean there was ... everywhere\nEverywhere that's right Facebook up a block them from putting promoted ads on an NPR refused to run an ad that told the truth about\nOh who ... well now was he was an

at all this guy used used talk the way the media doesn't want to talk about on the left doesn't want to talk about I'm pretty new to this woman talked about a Muslim purpose right\nIt is it absolutely is on purpose and that he really should be in that same pantheon of of these most infamous\nA serial killers who are in so many ways glorified 'em by the mainstream media and by Hollywood and\nUm and I think that it I I think with regard to the gods now um I've I've made it very clear about the movie and the book by the way that it is appropriate and safe for um teenagers to see this movie and um it is rated rated PG Thirteen and there's an incredible cast\nA including dean Cain Earl Billings Sarah Jane Morris uh next year see and I'm Andrew clay and who was the screenwriter here an incredibly brave and and bold um film that I Believe is at the intersection of art and investigative journalism\n... show on TV also which was ... what did you see on television news reports from comedy to remind\nYou and I realized because this huge we take that we're going to be discriminated against by being re we get that but hers mix usually get away with that I was being genes are Jews how did

politics you know they're not established um actors or\nA filmmakers are director's um but I think that you know as a result of everything that's been happening over the last\nYear or two years it's

we're so far away from the election you pick the conservative we take a cheap to people starting to relax and sit on their on their hands again on an election that we need them to be empowered to get up and vote\nThat is absolutely right and I and I think that it's not just the Kavanaugh effect but even you know this latest um peroxide a mob violence that's broken out all across the country the thing is that the left can never help itself\nAnd on the heels of even just this past weekend where we had Hillary opening up her mouth and writing that's another gift ah with her excusing her husband's abuses of power in the Lewinsky scandal right and then on top of that Hillary and bill going on they're corrupt to lose a\nTour and now it's all it's making with unforeseen airline with Eric

and it has crossed many at a logical line the ... a lot of left us won't talk about it they know what's happened with the burden of proof in America and they know that what happened to Brett Kavanaugh could happen to anyone and do\nThis this this mid term it's not just a a referendum I chopped versus mop it really is about due process those things we hold dear\nUm and the fact that you know many
