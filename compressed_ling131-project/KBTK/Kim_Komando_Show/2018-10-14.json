[noise]\n\nOkay one of the worst things that you can do is you can go on to Google dot com and search\nNeed to make money on line quickly because there's so many scams\nWhile there is one scam in particular that I Want to be on the lookout for until you more about that and just a moment but first here's the phone number one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four is the way to join us and of course when you're calling in there's Andrew ... gay and they came commando show ... hello there Andrew\nKim Eric is in Cincinnati, Ohio and this is the first I mean I've been answering phones here for a long time long if you have to say how many years Seventeen Seventeen no no sixteen years there's gonna be Seventeen then it's almost Seventy a\nLong time we should probably talk about not being an intern anymore you know what I'm going with it OK yeah less pressure\nUm and like you scoffed at when I said Seventy are no cash [laughter] sixteen pretty rough [laughter]\n... ... [noise] so Eric\nYes or he wants to be able to in non I'm asleep put photos on the Internet and when someone normally call for that I usually have a one line like hey that sounds like you want to break the law we're not going to put you on the radio to break the law but he actually has a good\n... you know one 'cause it sounds like revenge porn and I'm sure yeah something like something shady\nYes but he has good reason he used to have four adopted foster kids and he wants their grandparents to be able to see what they look like but he's not ready to fully dive in on the whole communication from\nThat is an interesting question yeah that is because it's so so Eric you want the grandparents to watch the kids grow up\n[laughter] yes that's exactly correct but\nI Know I was gonna say if it was just an open adoption is that what happened\n[noise] you know we adopted these children earlier this year they had been in foster care for four years prior to us giving them and we had them for a year before we adopted them so they've been out of the biological home for five\nYears or wow okay and this year the father of the biological father passed away and do we have some people are up for people who who have\nThis didn't contact and they asked if we can bring the children to the funeral and we said no we're not ready to do that yet right\nUm but they said well is there any way that we can we do watch them grow up and so I was looking for some way that I could anonymously present them pictures that they could see but I also don't want to just throw them out on the Internet for anyone to my I Want to be able to target who conceived\nI get that I get that or you know first of all what big heart than you and your wife and I have to take him for kids how old are the kids\nRight now they're seven eight ten and eleven\n[laughter] wow okay it's a full household\n[laughter] it's a full house for other kids of our own so [laughter] wow we have eight [laughter] that's awesome\nThat's awesome uh a couple of thoughts come into mind\nOr of course when you post photos you're going to make sure that there is no identifiable characteristics you know ... and so forth\nYeah I Would take out all the all the medical data and the E. X. I. F. data and you're going to have to use a photo editing program to strip all that out right\nUh because a lot of people don't realize and if you're like what the heck are these two people talking about is that if I put in a picture up on the Internet and I pulled it down is that I can open up the hidden data\nAnd then pretty much see where that photo was taken what type of camera et cetera or just on Google Map and so we want to make sure want to take all that stuff out a couple of thoughts you might want to consider I mean you've you have Google you have the school photos number one\nOr you can put them up there there's Yahoo Photos but one of the things that that came to mind when I was listening to your call is that if you go to say for example a photo sharing site like shut her fly okay\nShuttered fly will allow you to create not just photo albums but a particular website if you will that contains all the photos\nAnd so if they had and you don't have to figure out the best way to get the grandparents the the Web address but if they had the Web address they could just keep going back there to refresh it uh say once a week or once a month and so they can start seeing and then in addition to that you get a record of them going\nTo see it as well [noise] okay uh so\nJust said orders shutter fly and then sign up for an account and again there's going to be some options when you do this that you really looking for your own unique website and then once you do that whoever knows that addressed that there'll be able to access\nThose photos and again\nAside from just the medical data is make sure that there is no identical characteristics with the kids as far as any type of school logos\nOr anything else that might show where they're actually physically located at any of those shots are of course you can always use any photo editing program it just kind of race that stuff in the back and\n[noise] All right let's talk about one of our great sponsors there're works relieve their works relief like many of us do you suffer from muscle cramps and your legs in your feet well to experience relieve do what I Do you want to use their works relieve fast\nActing phone get their or works relieved today at the end of the pain relief file at your local pharmacy or at their works relief once again dot com\nOr before the back of your phone calls I got to tell you about of phones scam that's offering phony Amazon dot com jobs because especially this time of year\nAs a matter of fact we just did a pod cast command on demand about the whole gig economy different ways that you could earn some quick cash just in time for Christmas is that job scams are claiming to be from Amazon or totally on the rise\nAnd here's how this scam works and listen up you get a voice mail inviting you to apply for a job at Amazon it sounds like a pretty sweet set up I mean you can earn anywhere from twenty dollars an hour or two maybe even as much as six thousand dollars a month get fish you're working from home\nUsually those are websites with fictitious names like a Amazon cash Amazon cash website Web store jobs you name it\nBut here's the catch when you go to fill out the online application you were asked to purchase a two hundred dollar enrollment cat and then once you make the payment poof\nScammers got all your money and your dream of\nTelecommuting and earning cash in your bunny slippers so any job that issue for some sort of a front payment should should set off warning belts and if you are looking for legitimate ways to earn extra cash maybe you want to be an online tutor\nOf virtual assistant or maybe you want to even watch TV and take surveys get you can make money doing that live no further than\nThe official home page came commando show which is of course ...

five fifty to fifty four and before we go back to all of your fantastic phone calls this show or the more interesting items that courage crossed my desk and screen that you need to know about first to which\nThe state of California is banning week pass for that's right\nIt's a new law the state of California you know all those Internet connected devices all around your home you have cameras in thermostats routers garage doors the smart light bulbs the\nSmart crock pot for some reason well most of them come with these ridiculously easy to crack passwords for example many routers and Web cams ever default admin password like admitting her password so the idea that when you set up your new gadget you should always changed the default pass for\nMaking something strong that the cameras won't be able to crack\nBut that doesn't always happen so too many people are just leaving the default password in place making themselves targets for criminals and hackers who's cameras All right so lawmakers in California and trying to make that stop they just passed a law that goes into effect the beginning of twenty twenty it makes it illegal for companies\nJust said leak default passwords on devices but here's the gab yet made in the state\nThe problem is that looks to those Internet connected devices I just mentioned they're made in China\nOh the new law is going to require manufacturers to said complex unique passwords for all the devices they have to maybe come up with a startup procedure in place that forces the user to change the password I mean this is a long time coming when you think about it I mean but\nHow effective is really going to be ... probably not so much because as I mentioned everything's made in China\nOr a Google was in the news again this past week not just because they announced a whole slew of new pixel phones or because they had a major security breach\nWell they said it was a bug well that's what they always say it's a bug actually nobody was paying attention they expose the private information of about a half a million people for about three years thank you Google Google has its own social media site called Google Plus they announced between twenty Fifteen and march or twenty Eighteen\n\nAll right so we started talking about smart TV the thing that makes the TV smart is that what it can accept to the Internet\nWell once you can make something up to the Internet guess what else can happen yeah the hackers in scammers and the bad things can go on well this past week a big security alert for certain brand of television that they had to listen they had to they had to run down and install these firmer updates but the problem is that\nThey want you to install the former update so if you don't know about this update then you're sitting there just fed them unhappy watching TV and actors can be doing whatever they want\nGetting onto your TV and then on to the network so that's coming up and just a few moments but first the phone lines are open one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once again is the way to join us and as always there's Andrew but then the and the kids come into show man gave up before we talk about the call yes\nThat are coming in here it's third our this this weekend show\nUm I\nAm still wearing my apple watch no you might recall it was probably what was it eight or nine months ago when I was really excited about having an apple watch and you got for three right I had a serious threat\nAnd you know both you and Mike or like my brother's right page so you've seen me embrace technology and throw it away\nOver the years so I was really super excited about having an apple watch and the first time I ward YouTube took bats\nHow long were you aware of when we had the over under going yeah yeah okay and so ... what was that that I think it was two and a half we like to read and and then after two weeks that would be like wow I don't need that it was stupid thing right so I took the under that you would not last two weeks which would be you know to ... shows\nRight to ... and you'd be\nYou'd be to buy a mile I think you ward maybe seven eight shows in a row\nAnd then it does appear\nBennett tapered off a little bit right okay a because what was happening is that I was getting like too much like like what are my steps [noise] what is my ... pm you know 'cause I can\nBe a little obsessive compulsive what little seedy who ... who who would dare say that about I mean we were just upstairs\nAnd I am a ... I'm a little hungry sure and so we went up to the break room and what did I Do Michael\nCredit for the pizza [noise] but ah you I thought you were a guy I thought holy cow Kim is going to eat pizza and I was going to be higher and she was to hurt innocent you open the box and she was just showing somebody where the pizza off\nSo I went to my oven and got an apple\nBlame ah I Know\nAnd it's really funny because I had to go get my annual checkup\nThis past week and so I was with my mail dock and I'm like oh look at my ... pm and this this and that is right that they're showing them the app on your phone yeah your doctor yes for\nAn end like looks like sometimes you know it's forty for a good resting heart rate [laughter] what did you say it's a she always ours and she says she goes that is like an excellent rest resting heart rate\nAnd she said you know what your cholesterol is right now\nYou know what your cholesterol had no idea okay Mike do you know years is no idea how can you really need it let me take you guys need to know ...\nIt's not high so uh we're good and you know a high because my doctor told me I think our soul medication everyone's hide give me bills right well\nYou have to have everything in your online portal oh yeah okay okay so that you can sign and you can see that stuff\n[noise] so anyway so my cholesterol and I don't take anything like was like one twenty started\nWell two hundred and it's like good okay so yeah so and that's because I you can afford to have one piece of pizza you know but I can do it I Can't you know what I couldn't even do it it's it's it's a curse is what I'm telling you so do it so the apple watch for\nThat I have right now that was the one where it'll tell people if you fall slip or slide\nThe presentation yes and that it will get you know has ... gyroscope built right out\nAnd so that you can hit a button which I think is fabulous you know that you can hit a button and be and then but it will also do an east Fiji which is kind of like an EKG OK okay\nBut you ... where you're going to be able to put your finger on the dial and so you'll be able to get it in east CGI have you I mean you know because it doesn't work yet it hasn't been ruled out\nAnd so that's kinda lame I think of apple that white white teases and not ... that they tell you if you buy the new one out you're going to happen and ISI

Texas I Love Austin, Texas and she wants to tell you how fabulous the Apple Google\nTranslate it was just talking about that in just a second ago she went to Finland and she's got gobs in gobs of stories to tell you my gosh did you have to yet so so you use it in Finland so how did it work\nI I did it work fabulously I didn't have a smartphone my friend lent me hers and a letter it up with the little translate and I went up to Northern Ireland\nWhere my cousin lives and typically maybe uh the spouse speak English that maybe the wife doesn't sure\nAnd we had a very very good communication because you can speak a ... tax and then you can also get the scans what the photo on ... material\nWhich is great because then you can take a picture of something and wonder like you know what is that vehicle really do or what does that say you know have you ... did you find that to be accurate\nOr I can be quite accurate though only hit that's well yeah it was with proper names are a bit beyond that um you know it was absolutely true authentic\nNow if if somebody were to tell you Susan ten years ago that you'd be able to go to Finland and have this technology right at your fingertips [noise] would you believe them\nNo I Would have been given back slid\nI Know isn't that crazy it's just now coming soon is that we're going to actually have translation a ear pots and so that this way if you have your\n... and somebody speaking Spanish is that it's going to automatically translate in your ear into English so you're going to hear it in your language of choice which is just amazing so\nYou know if you haven't already and they do so much for your call today Susan letting everybody know you know that it really does work I mentioned I've used it recently and France and it worked without a hitch a phase me several times looking at the menus saying what is it\nThat I can actually eat on this menu and I was able to with my phone bill to figure it all out to the once again thank you for your call\nLet's talk a little bit about the ... my favorite printer my printer of choice\nYou can learn more right now at ... dot com slash ego tank Kim it's the model number is a forty seven fifty and I think in the box to print 'em to eleven thousand color pages learn more epson dot com slash Pico tank Kim epson exceed your vision\nRight having a smart TV is one of the great benefits of modern technology but when your TV connects to the Internet it becomes vulnerable\nWell news out this past week that if you if they don't eat and ... a TV you really need to get into the settings and do a system up day because there are no three critical bugs so that means is that hackers can come in\nAnd they can come in and take over the the television and the ones that are in the television they can take over the entire network\nAnd anything else that may be connected to anything else that may be connected to it rather\nSo to learn more about it and links that you might need and to check to see if you're probably is on the list with no further than commando dot com it's K. O. M. A. N. D. O. dot com and winter there hit that show picks button stay right where you are you're still on Facebook some three D. photos are coming your way you're on the came commando show [noise]\nFrom coast to coast through your source for\nAs a business owner I rely on del small business technology advisors\nI'm Kim commando now you and I both know there's nothing small about our businesses are reputation is always on the line and that's where the Dell small business technology advisors come in reliable del PCs with intel core processors or rock solid\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business you have more\nA little too you\nYou'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore\nSo\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for that service so that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\n... is that to to accentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization\nAnd to learn what it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say over five thousand dollars we'll put you at the top of the Google Search results\nThat will right All right well you know you can be at the top of the Google Search results right now and it's not going to cost you a lot of money because you can do a cost per click campaign so somebody types and whatever your medical profession is in your town within the ZIP codes\nYou maybe pay ten cents for every click\nBut you're not going to be at the bottom of page you're not going to be on page too so you start thinking of different ways that you can market your business instead of putting that money and depending upon somebody else to quote unquote get rid of the bad stuff on line\nOkay does that make sense for those who say I'm I Do some sort of like customers I Try to help them to go on and put on a positive review forest\nIs just to get them to do it as like a should I Try to at a\nPet or something else and that's right and then say they can you do it here now\nYeah you put a pet right there exactly uh that's really smart\nAnd number you know and you could have a forum where they fill out you know positive and then they check a box that says this this can you know this goes up to health grades or whatever it may be\nBut the other thing too is you can have a basket their gift basket and every thirty days we pick a winner from that gift basket\nOkay so we pick a winner from somebody who did who left a positive review or somebody who left of Greek review for us\nAnd so and that's\nThat can beyond that little card or that could be on the printed receive that could be part of the email confirmation or the text that they get confirming appointments and you know so you start you know sit down and just make a list of all the different touch points that you have with that particular customer\nAnd then think of different ways that you can give them an incentive\nYou know maybe they write a negative review that's okay if you learn something from it you know you move on you make it better but you start going in and you start telling them what you want and that's the thing about people most people want to help you most people are really good nature\nBut they may not know that this is what you need and so if you tell them at least four times 'cause the average person has to hear something four times before they act\nAs that hopefully they'll get in there and do that now if for some reason this doesn't work in thirty days\nAnd want you to give me a call back and we'll go to the next level but I think you'll find that people will give you that review as long as you ask for and thank you for your call or let's talk about one of our great
