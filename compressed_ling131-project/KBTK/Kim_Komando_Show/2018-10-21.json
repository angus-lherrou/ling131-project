hello there Andrew\nKim we have a ... or I should say Dr Bonnie Dr Bonnie in Chicago yes she is a doctor and she was going to start doing tele medicine so like like\nSeeing patients over Skype and costs time and things like that exactly see I think that is amazing technology have you ever tried it no I've never done okay I have and so you want to look at this especially because you have kids young kids\nIs that you know if the kids get sick and you have to take him to the pediatrician we did last night okay then there's like the clean you know that they're supposed to be like the the wealth side and the six side yeah there's about four feet of corporate separate or\nNearly so the germs really aren't going to go from there to hear hey where do you think you're doing the acquaintance I Would say over there and then they give you that tend to use right the gate and you're like was that the Clinton side or the other side pen okay\nWhen doctors on call doctors on demand and you know you might even have that as part of your health care package 'cause we have it here was star as part of our health care package is that you can go on line\nDownload the app and you see a doctor right on your phone one thing that only fear ... stuff alone is going to bomb\nAnd they can prescribe antibiotics they can to fill up eight using another doctor\nIt's absolutely may as well this is going to be a change for Dr Bonnie but she wants to know when the technical side\nHow before logging on and greeting a ... a patient can choose to make sure the lighting is right at the camera looks good maybe she looks good on camera before she jumps in and starts talking to a patient yeah because you don't want to look bad no no you have to look you know\nBody you have to look hot\n[laughter] yes yes I this is going to be quite a transition going from a brick and mortar office to my home office where I can either use my Mac laptop or even my eye\nPad and iPhone right yeah so um I just didn't know if there was a way that I can do is ... feet check to see you know if the lighting is okay for me maybe the background the position of the camera I Know you're supposed to look into the eye of the camera and not the actual screen writing\nThings like that so I did I wanted to know what I can do to prepare before you actually get out and start thinking\nWell you know the big thing is is that we want to make sure there's a good light on you okay\nAnd in Chicago you have sunny days and you have cloudy days right yes and you have a cold winter days I've been there like that so I'm the best case scenario is that you get what's called a Ringo light I don't know if you've heard of this and it's a it is a rank\nUh I can put a link to one for you that I Would recommend free over at Amazon dot com and so what does it has it's for a facial ... like portraits of people use that for it's also when you're on when you're using a Web cam is that you have a tendency to be washed out okay\nWith the ring light is exactly what it is is that it's going to illuminate your face K. and so that this way people are better able to see you and you'll actually you will actually look better lit up than dark a lotta people say oh no I Lived veteran or dark restaurant\nNothing not so much K now when you're faces illuminated within the background will appear darker OK okay and so you being a doctor I Would want to see your credentials on the wall\nMe anyway I Want to see those diplomas you know what I mean even though I Can't I won't be able to read them\nI Want to see all your awards I Want to know where you went to medical school I mean I I'm not gonna be able to look that closely but I can tell what they are right okay and of course you want to get rid of any junk behind you to you don't strike me as a person but you know we've interviewed people before like this guy you know for jobs here\nAnd you know and you look and they have this like there was a hoarders behind them and you're like ooh what is that pile that is true right so we clean all that up\nNow there are ways when you have faced time for example that you can hit a button this was going to be hard but what I Would do is I Would just record say a couple of seconds\nAnd then you don't have to worry about just taking pictures of you know record some video of yourself for thirty seconds the big thing too that a lot of people don't realize funny is that you want to smile OK\nOkay and because when you smile you look welcoming\nAnd I'm sure you've done that you know where it's hard to deliver bad news but you might have a little bit of a smile you know race or because there's a whole side of\nI mean I have a lot of friends who are doctors my I hear a lot of the bad story but I also here are the good stories you know yeah and um but you know so being letting your personality come through have you ever done this before\n[noise] uh only and Web in ours but not actually as a patient doctor saying\nThis is so cool I'm so excited frail um the ring lights are about sixty bucks okay and it makes like I said it makes total difference if you're going to love what you see when you record a couple of\nMinutes of yourself because at that point you're going to say yes a little extra blush sometimes works too when you're on a webcam because uh you seem to be a little bit washed out even if you do have this ring light and again thank you for your call\nHey speaking of let's talk about\nTheir or works relieved like many of us she might suffer from muscle cramps in your legs and

everything digital digital got is Kim [noise]\nAs a business owner I rely on del small business technology advisors I'm Kim commando now you and I both know there's nothing small about our businesses are reputation is always on the line and that's where the Dell small business technology advisors come in\nAt a sports bar downtown Tempe when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work that somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at\nSo if you're at target would\nYou tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you want but and bad but at ... okay\nBut sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said in and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat if I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nThe ... percent point eight hundred dollars or something and\nThey had to tip jars okay and so you know not only can you tip on the receipt but they actually had tip jars right\nOne was one said for all you Android people and the other ones had for all you iPhone people and the iPhone ... drivers like overflowing [laughter] and the Android One\nDidn't have anything yeah I was at a a video game thing and they said if you think the X. box sucks shape here if you think the PlayStation ... it's just a ploy it's just like you said before giving people out of their money\nBut how about this one this is a little different when we order on my sister's kids came over for dinner or something like let's just get a bunch of barbecue so we go on Amazon restaurants right a bunch of barbecue and I get the total and it's like a hundred and twenty five dollars and I was like that's a lot more than I was expecting\nRight they automatically added on a twenty five per cent tip after also charging me a delivery fee okay that that's really tough because they don't even ask you yeah and you know\nDoor dashes notorious for that and also overeat because they'll say like pricing search\nOkay and so they add another five dollars\nIf you order something that's under ten dollars there'll be a small order delivery charge\nYou know or whatever maybe but maybe it's like being a server at one point in my life I actually will tip the whole foods or the Amazon Prime driver or whatever it is I'll actually add more like he's like okay I got a whole foods delivery yesterday\nAnd it was probably I think it was like a hundred and fifty dollars\nSo you got two things yeah I had seven and broccoli [laughter]\nWhich is probably about it and some sushi okay\nAnd if the tip was a recommended to was twelve dollars Cape and so I was ten percent okay I ... I gave the guy sixteen\nI gave him an extra four or five I Wonder what I mean the research has got to be out there but this worked otherwise the apps that are doing this the squares and stuff like that big wouldn't include it\nWell and because you know remember they're making a percentage of the total even on a tip yes okay because they charge square and the other one said two point nine percent two and a half percent of as a transaction fee of the total amount right okay so if they can\nGet that told and thinking about this if they can get the total amount up\nBy five dollars I Would think the tip of the dollar is no no no you pay the whole transaction than what the ... what is that what is the bottom line transaction then you have to pay a fee for them collecting the money and doing things like that and ... and I don't mind\nI'm Still not tipping well I'll just hard it is hard and you know I I don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm just a nicer more generous person than you are there was no maybe about it uh that I think that you know but I but sometimes it is kind of awkward you know tipping again for just like what is normally\nAnd what we should be considered like just part of the experience like somebody handing you a napkin\nSo here's ten percent instead of having an African images use the cash that you're expecting me to put him to like my ... something like that

I've been within twenty twelve okay but the past month is just so slow here that the Internet's almost useless [noise] so I'm looking at switching to Comcast\nFor my Internet and income can't say well we also have mobile and so I thought well that might be a great service but\nI'm concerned that maybe it won't be because they do use the same price and towers and would switch between pricing towers and Comcast hot spots so I don't know I like I Am\nI I don't I don't I don't know if I'd Lincoln switching between the hot spots um [noise] you you know what you okay ... you know which you could possibly get and I don't know ... varieties and you know would give you a deal on or sometimes if you complain loud enough you get it for free\nIs the you may be able to get a little what's called a ... self or your house and so it's kind of like a repeat or off of the cell tower itself\nAnd but the thing with the ... and this is why I kinda went a robust Comcast is that if Comcast\nIs usually other sent to sell to increase your reception in your bars I don't know if I like that either\nUm so my first recommendation we go back to arise in and say listen I Need to have some type of Microsoft or something that you can I can put inside my house\nThat will repeat the signal from the tower that you have nearest may so I get a stronger signal and then they'll say no we can't do that because you're only talking to a rap\nBut if you get up into a manager a supervisor level and explained to them that you're paying for the service and you're not getting everything that they promised sometimes you can get it for free if not that it's like a hundred maybe two hundred\nBucks okay okay\nNow let's talk a little bit about the cell phone towers than that even though like for rising and AT and T and Comcast or maybe they can share cell towers\nThey often use different frequencies in technologies so they're not actually sharing the hardware on the tower makes sense\nOkay huh um and then they're usually own now the towers are owned by a leasing company not even by the provider anymore because the providers figured out that they could sell\nThe uh the towers and they don't have to carry that that and they can make more money so the thing that you could go back to Comcast with it they you know\n... which frequency is Comcast on a tower and how does that compare a variety so that this is not that you're going to know what all this means but just this way if the numbers are different than you know that that it should be different of that one service might be better\nAnd I and Comcast senses the cable companies some of this band with maybe coming off the cable to now there is hope on the horizon\nAnd the hope on the horizon is five gee\nAnd it's supposed to get better for all of us that are having cell phone problems um because basically you're talking on poor gee you're talking about one gig abet a per second speed versus\nOn five gee you're talking about multiple database and so you know couple of solutions that you might wanna try before you just dumped ... do you think you could call ask one of your neighbors if they have Comcast\n[noise] I could try that we don't have real real close neighbor from afraid of 'em [laughter] I knew that we know but um [noise] but I could try that\nBecause sometimes you know and and of course you know they may say it's great and then you get it and then you're mileage may very right if I could be\nYou know here's where I'm at you know what you might want to do is\nExplain to Comcast what the problem is at Comcast turn turn on the line you try it for a couple of days see how it works explained to them I don't want to sign up for a long term contract right now I Want to be able to at least ten and put my tone or she would I'm getting\nAnd you know let me tell you something the cable companies are struggling right now they'll do anything to keep occurring customers to get a customer so again you might have to escalate this little bit up higher\nBut it's definitely something that you might want to take a look at doing just having a conversation\nAnd Karen thank you so much for your call Gary in South bend hello there Gary what's going on [noise]\nHi I'm doing on looking or an app that I can secure some\nMoney to a private party\nUm [noise] I was in a small car accident and\nRather than go through the ... center it's a um it's a friend of mine who like to take care of it personally sure I'm I'm just looking for secure after that I can send her um\nPayments or I'm not not something we all use all the time that something I can for the articles on her own and so\nI you know a couple of ways you can do it you know [noise]\nJust just a\nRule of thumb is when you're sending money to friends be you know you have to be really careful make sure that you have everything done correctly because they don't issue refunds okay\nA couple of options you've have Google Wallet you'll have pay pal and one of the most popular ones out there now is something called ... and all of them charged two point nine percent as far as to make this wire transfer a busy exceptional pay pal they charge two point nine percent plus thirty stems\nAnd but if you're looking for a safe secure way you don't want to give out your checks or maybe you don't even have a bank account anymore\nIs that you want to take a look at as I mentioned Google Wallet probably pay pal is the one that's most commonly used then mow it seems to be getting a lot of traction though as time goes on Gary thank you for your call it the right where you are we have our money to coming up and more of your phone calls that you don't want to miss here on the ... do show [noise]\n\nNo breathing marriages digital cameras on them\n\nThe years I've tried and tested every way that average people can and should back of the debt on their computers I'll tell you that I drive it's simply the best climbed backup service there is for big reasons why\nAnd the August ... is the best but\nWhen you start looking at locks that they have different system so you ... you can't just buy the lock and it goes on the Internet is that you buy the lock and then it connects to a hub okay so you have like a smart things have or you have what what I have is the next year up okay\nAnd then within the next year Hubbard is where things have you'll find that there are other things that you can do so like if you wanted certain lights to come on and the middle you know say from eleven PM to six am when nobody's there\nSo at least illuminates maybe less likely for somebody to break in\nIs that you can program the lives for that if you had certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nIs that there were water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so once you once you get the hub Charlie's what I'm saying is that once you get the hobby you start thinking about OK\nWhat more can I add to this right it is so good ...\nYou know so if there are there any other things that we can for a couple of hundred bucks because that's all you're talking about\nRight that they are that's awesome audio yeah then it might be worth it okay so when you start looking at different products the smart things so this is where it gets confusing is that you've got the wave in the bay and those are different standards\nAre ... and that works with the smartest things next to the uh everything works like um I have a a train air conditioner that I can control remotely you know on the next year or so so so that's what I'm trying to some trying to expand your horizons so once we had the ... what else can we do if this\nLaw took things yeah it's exciting I mean it's really cool to doctors all states with the holograms turning Allegra\nAndrew don't you think that you and I would ... be excellent at doing like a theatre version of the game commando\nShow absolutely agree making a musical well I don't know I can think commando them he was one that I don't [laughter]\nI don't think we'd go past one I have no memory and just say so anyway popular demand women I don't have a say in ... and ... that was we didn't even make it to like like Broadway in ... that was it that's off off off all authors\nRuns right or the ... it's more intimate but the ... [laughter]\nAll right so the next the assistance and could set you back eight dollars and Ninety nine cents a month\nOr write or say\nThat's it not a big deal so I'll take a look at the there's the the show legs fence and connect\nOK okay\nThe next ... about sixty bucks the lock is going to set you back a hundred and fifty and then you're looking at say just for giggles ten bucks a month\nAnd\nThen it allows you to program all those codes get reports whose common and what's going on with that and then if you could set it for twenty four hours and then and if somebody does is you do you think something was wrong you can just kill that code and killed it automatically there's no delay\nYou can also un slate yeah you can set up a code really ... you know if you're if you're doing anything remotely\nA really makes sense that you start looking at smart stuff and order to be notified and get alerts and good things like that who Charlie thank you for your call and keep us posted on what's going on in great band and how that lots working out for you\nAll right speaking of homes will talk a little bit about simply save longtime sponsor of the came commando show and you know I remember when I first met Chad the founder of simply safe and he sat back and I walked upstairs to my office and I thought to myself wow you know Chad the adventurous simply say if he's just one of those guys\nYou see the brain cell activity we know exactly is going to forgive freaking genius and we've been told you for the past couple of months that as a company's simply safe is now valued at more than a billion dollars\nMean Chad is very smart he has a great company you've got a great product and get this over two million homes are now protected with us simply save own security system\nIn other words not only am I recommend it simply say ... millions of other people because here's the deal simply say as comprehensive protection for your home and for your family was round the clock professional monitoring and police dispatch\nIt's built for the unexpected and it has to be keeps working even during the local power and why fi outage even if a burglar smashes your key pad that police will be on their way\nPlus system is so super easy to use it's incredibly intuitive takes only minutes to set up and this is the other great part about it you're going to love that you just open the box yeah plug it in no drilling no wires was simply say if there are no contracts know hidden fees\nNo nonsense this is why it's such an amazing product and why everybody loves it\nPlus twenty four seven monitoring ugly fourteen Ninety nine a month if you live alone you don't need to live in fear somebody in your family's living alone your your parents maybe it's a\nA kid away at college get them simply safe system right now and the listener I became commando show you get free shipping and free returns visit simply save Kim Dotcom once again that simply say Kim Dotcom to protect your family today simply ...\nDo you get free shipping and free returns visit simply save Kim Dotcom once\nAgain that's simply save Kim Dotcom to protect your family today simply save Kim Dotcom\nAlright so often here on the came commando shall we talk about all the latest gadgets and gizmos and you might be wondering well you know which ones are really worth our money like we just talked about was Charlie and great bend Kansas you know the smart locks are worth the money\nBut let's talk about streaming devices you know if you're not part of the whole streaming revolution cutting the cord you will be there's so many to choose from\nBut which one is right Kay talked a little bit about this and the digital life back to it but you've got the Google Chrome cast Roku Apple TV and Amazon has the for K O trades day comes with Alexa voice and fired TV we're going to tell you exactly which is the right one to you\nWhen it comes down for smartphones you have the apple acts are excess you've got an Android a Samsung Galaxy and the Google pick so with the three being the most recent version of that\nThat's worth money security cameras were looking at the nets camps of course there's the cheaper one the wide camp but don't forget simply say they also can give you a security cams to digital assistants\nAmazon's echo Google Home and also you have a the apple home pot it's really just\nJury was a great set of speakers the best value you're looking at the second generation echo plus it's hard to beat at a hundred and fifty dollars\nA fitness watch everybody wants one of those you've got fitbit versus the apple watch if you're looking for the biggest bang for the buck let me tell you the fitbit charge three is a great choice\nAt a hundred and fifty dollars that measure stepped and also monitors your heart rate to we have links to all of these over at commander dot com head over to K.
