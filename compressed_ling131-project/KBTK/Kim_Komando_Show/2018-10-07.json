against\nThey'll become this hour that came commando show but the phone lines are open one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four wants to get it the way to join us and when you're calling again there's Andrew but been skiing that Kim commando show man cave Kim though there Andrew so Scott in Charleston South Carolina called him [noise]\nJust got back from months in Europe and Russia and we're worried about Internet Security\nAnd ice and Scott you just got back shouldn't\nHave been the hall you mean for your own when\n[laughter] just you know just a little heads up Scott [laughter] next time give us a call before\nYou go [laughter] I mean he said yes I sure do but we're\nPlanning on going back and it got me thinking next time we go to Russia how can we prepare ourselves and be secure OK so a friend of mine who lives in London in Iraq or you know okay is that um she was telling me that she went to Beijing\nAnd so she had her windows laptop they're connected to the hotel why fight [laughter] okay and she said all of a sudden the the hard drive light like when okay and it stayed constantly illuminated for the next eight hours wonder why\nDo you think they were copying the entire hard drive not the Chinese oh they would not do that at all gosh God neither what the Russians what are you worried about\n[noise] [laughter] well I Would love to have the opportunity to talk to you before we called but that was not an option and in fact I have a kind of a two part question number one the ... always been ours devices or less ...\nThan a Android or PCs now if you just first confirmed that then I Want to talk about the peons\nOkay um [noise] the reason why that people say that Iowa devices are more secure is that there are ... that apple keeps a hold on everything okay\nSo in order for you to penetrate through the operating system is that you have to go through multiple levels of encryption you can jail break an iPhone or if you want him to and basically take all the security and the trolls and ripped away\nBut if you are trying to get a piece of now we're onto an Iowa this device that it is more difficult than say Android or window so yes that is true\n[noise] well what I did do\nSorry on this trip\nWas caught a little bit of a cold [laughter]\nDo us a did set up a VPN but I wondered if that was enough or if there was more the U.S should be doing in the situation of [noise]\nWhat did you do everything while you were overseas I mean did your bank can pay your credit cards and shut case or in business and stuff like that\nI did have to check my bank once or maybe twice but I Try to avoid that didn't do anything with credit cards except ... to pay ... a a it was mainly just to tricky meal\nAnd then did you do everything through the VPN or did you fall like uh where where you go like well I'm just going to take the email one\n[noise] it was so much that is there were several types it seemed like the the piano prohibited me from getting on a website and I don't mean that particular website it it's just like anything getting on the Internet period\nAnd it could do that depending upon what lockdown can be in a particular community and a particular country and so I'm a lot of VPN where if you look at their coverage maps and then you want to make sure that they have multiple access points within one particular city\nAnd so that this way you can get out if you want it to ... you know if it's a it's a really interesting topic because in my email this past week I also had a note from a gentleman who was in China and couldn't go anywhere because he was in China you know of course they didn't have the great firewall there\nAnd they're stealing anything that they can but that's a whole another topic when you are ... traveling in countries like Russia and you do come back you know the general rule is that number one before you go is that you make a complete backup of everything\nA so that this way if you need to restore it then you'd be able to because sometimes coming back in the country or going to a country believe it or not that you may have your device confiscated\nAnd if it is confiscated weather here or abroad or three or six month you might be able to see it again but quite possibly a year and nobody wants that to happen so that was not your issue I Would recommend that you change all your passwords to any account that that you have had access to\nA especially your even though you didn't use a VPN because I wouldn't want you to take any unnecessary risks and then be sitting here thirty days after a trip and typically they're going to wait until you you're at home for thirty days and then you start seeing some weird stuff happening you know what I mean\nUm and if you haven't already set up some type of authentication on your bank account I Would definitely encourage that but in my wallet I carry a\nIt's about the size of a thumb drive I don't know if you've ever seen the news and the thumb drive has a rotating code on it and even now I can tell you I can show you that there's a coat on it and every thirty seconds I get a brand new code if you don't have that code you can't have access to my bank account so I Would try to ... I Would encourage\nYou to see if you can still some of that type of a extra layers of protection as well and they sent me for you to just give us call we're here for you um but congratulations on a great trip at a safe return but again just spent some time and change all those passwords\nAnd listen I have to tell you if you haven't heard about the brand new commando ambassador ... super excited

[laughter] yeah well it in that too yeah what it is it's a it's something you'd rather it seems like something revenue and so I just wanted to get the information out there that folks out because you know as you know hackers that are finding new ways to probe into your uh to access your money\nAnd now just a few weeks ago we got a phone call from our local law I'm I'm a credit union and they know our habits anyway they they they got a um a um\nCheck that said a so called purchase set up and you're Fifteen thousand dollars from the um [noise] a popular a sporting goods chain and uh they produced we went to go see them excellent they produce that similarly up there's it's our check we don't use two minute checks\nBut somebody was able to take our check and and there's er there's there's there's or address there's are routing number there's already ... the the the check never was a little bit different but there was it was like fourteen thousand dollar her hands from from this this place and I called to if I can say the name of the company\nYeah sure go ahead yeah it's a ... okay so I called them\nThat's a lot older that's a lot of fishing gear by the way they are saying oh and I'm old [laughter] All right but wait wait before you continue I Want to know to send the check looks really good\nIt was it was a it was\nOur check the only difference was that it had a different name on it [noise] and uh yeah so yeah we had that so when I I I contacted a they they were most interested in and say what was going on because I told her I said that if it's it's not just one\nBut I suspect that there may be some other things going on maybe it's not only with our account but with other people's accounts as well sure and sure enough you out there it was and so they they put a stop on it but the guy said that he had his experience\nWas that this was the second or third ah like I'm a I'm a ... a problem that he had seen and so I don't know if this was if he had any awareness that there was something that you might be able to offer because the next day here where the credit union\nAnd and to do the fraudulent paperwork and or I kind of good stuff well the the bank manager right then and there as she got some information\nAnd she said hey they just took nine hundred us who are checking um she yeah yeah they were\nOkay so so so that the number one I'm impressed that your credit union called you I mean that's really something right there I don't know a lot of banks that might do that a number two is that they were able to potentially pass this checks through so what what are the banks say that you could do as precautionary means right now\n[laughter] well the only thing that we had to do was to actually shut down the the our account number and switch over to another one not that the routing number wasn't anything um but certainly because we wanted to maintain a weight we'd been there for years and that again they know our habits that was a kind of a defensive player\nI so I guess the the big thing take take away message here is that a lot of people don't like to keep track of their checking accounts right I mean\n[laughter] well sometimes it's just very easy not to think about doing that and I and to be honest this caught us at off guard a bit because we were right smack him right smack in the middle of but just sold our house and a house that we are we're right in the middle of moving I mean it was like a constant\nAnd you know and then when you're moving like that I mean jeeze I mean the last thing you want to think about is if somebody's trying to steal from you know what I mean it's crazy\nUm you know what rainy thank you so much for your call today and thank you for spreading the word because there is any takeaway take home message from this is that if you have not been watching what's going on with your checking account\nYou need to do it at least once a month for the appointment on your calendar so then it pops up on your phone and say you know it just scan it doesn't take too long\nI mean obviously you've noticed at Fifteen thousand dollars taken out but they may just start by with just a few bucks hey listen you want to stay right where you are because coming up and just a few moments we're talking about voice fishing scams you won't believe how clever they're getting Iran became Amanda ...

we're in light of all of these things and you're just mentioned about technology and you mentioned about monitoring couch when I'm done primary\nBut large amount of people to call it generally seniors are they tend to be a good target for fraudsters what do you think is probably the best reason for them to get involved or stay involved on line with technology what's the biggest reason than your mind that would be beneficial to them\nAnd what why do you ask\n'em personally I've run into the worst\nUm I've I've I've seen and heard it all over the many many years that have been doing this uh I've talked to many Rand is over the past um I've dealt with\nThe truck scams that you mentioned um and all of those are very personal one universal thing pretty much comes into play and unless
