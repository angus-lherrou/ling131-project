Andrew is that that your router was compromised and your Gmail account was compromise is that what I heard\nThe to what they believe is okay and then what steps have you taken since\nEveryone said the same thing that I needed to immediately change passwords and make them complex\nOn the route or and also the change passwords on my email and anything that my email is used for to get into in a kennel ... for instance a bank account if I sign up with my email I should change the password correct so I've done all of that\nOkay and now you're wondering what else can you do wow I Know yeah\nI'm Wondering about like is there such a thing as an ... for a home\nOr or some sort of a bundle that you could buy the yeah monitors things\nUh it just seems like the alternative is to put\nA different

of our data and I'm concerned about maybe some a professional type of protection\nI say okay and you know what and rightfully so I mean because you know it's it's once you get your data compromises you feel so vulnerable don't you I mean it's like sure you know all this was going on and you had no idea until somebody told you that this information is being downloaded through the router\nAnd did they say that maybe are computers are being used to house any type of pirated material\n[noise] I'd never heard the ...\nOr a cause that's a lot of data fifty gigs in a day I mean that's huge or so the\nBest way more than once and you feel well\nYes that's what I was thinking that maybe uh 'cause what sometimes with the the hackers do is that they find a vulnerable computer and then they house files there and then they tell everybody to go access the files on your computer or so that this way they're not liable or you know they they it's harder for them to be tracked\nOkay to be tracked down a so I Would definitely go through and look at data usage on any type of gadget that was connected to it you know with the route or like you said like you know you give it a good a password and you can also do Mac addressing have you lived in into that\nYou know get media access control\nOr what that means is that the only devices that are going to have access to your route or those devices that you permission okay and and so I Would definitely turn that on for Mac addressing I you also want to make sure that the DNS servers have has not made that they have not been changed as well\nUh and you can get into your router and also your ... to\nDo that turn on the Mac fire walls also with your Google Account you want to do a security events check there's there are a lot you need to do

what's going on\nOkay so we have a a hot spot it's like a ... attack and we have unlimited plant [noise] ah we have twenty five gigabytes of data and we used it chain\nIn like four hours and then we go down to the bottom and slow extremely slow okay so far or ours wow\nYeah because I have two teenage boy it's you're updating their [laughter] video game um X. box and and what not and [noise]\nAnd then my husband and I like to look at things on the Internet and then I have another one that has an eye pad he likes to get games and [noise] it's just to the point where I was just\nI'm frustrated so I was wondering if a we boost for the home it's a cell phone signal booster that I've looked at and you plug it into one of the house and plug it into the other end of the house and I was just wondering if something like that would work for us\n[noise] no [noise] no [noise] um it's all it's doing at that point is boosting the signal okay and so it's amplifying\nThe signal so the whole idea is that if you don't have decent sailor coverage is that you can buy this booster and then instead of having like three bars you might have for bars okay uh and it does it by amplifying the connection with in a certain area around you\nOkay a case on so and that's not gonna help you um I assume that you this is the only option\n[noise] well I'm that's why I'm calling you because it it's to the point where we've gone over to a friend's house the Internet to uh teach\nWhat you know what she because you know if you know you can get fifty gigs\nGone over to a friend's house to have Internet chew a cake [laughter]\nWell you know what is\nIt because you know if you know you can get fifty gigs but if you're blowing through fifth you know Fifteen gigs in four hours I mean what's the sense right I mean\nYou're right there's a\nThere's always satellite\nAnd yeah we try well we've heard our neighbors just\nPrayed about it yeah if you don't want to especially when you're looking at games and you've got three guys in the house that are trying to do games that's not going to work or doesn't work very well it also crawls um\nHave you looked into a DSL line\nAnd that comes from a company ... because we've called our a teeny tiny and\nIs that those Bactrim\nYes okay back them and charter and nobody will come down our wrote them since two thousand for um [noise]\nI'm just for giggles okay let me tell you let me tell you a couple of things from Kay [noise]\nIs it a friend of mine recently purchased a home in North of ... there's probably isn't going to be the day but north of Scottsdale, Arizona okay [noise] and so you have Phoenix you have Scottsdale and then you had like this stretch of road where there's nothing\nOkay miles around and\nAnd she bought this beautiful house in the middle of five acres okay All right it's in the house has like a thousand square feet but she likes it because there is she has no neighbors right\nRight now she's also a doctor on call [noise]\nAnd so before so she has a house in escrow and she's totally Cosby she freaks out it's like\nOh my God what am I going to do I don't think there's Internet and we I have this house in escrow\nSo I told her just to uh I I did some homework for her and I found a a a a gentleman who lives about a mile away from her\nWho who has a line and has set up a point to point Internet access service with some of his neighbors\nOK okay and she pays fifty dollars a month and\nShe said she's got Netflix she's moved in she has no issues you know things like that her kids are now in college so she doesn't have to worry about you know three kids gaming she has five kids and no she was worried about that right\n[noise] but\nBut still she is able to get to to fight in and she has to look at you know X rays or whatever it may be just look at them in real time right mhm\nSo but she's able to do that through a point to point service so I'd see if there were any options in in a if you just Google your ZIP Code with point to point that's what it's called ... or sometimes it's called fixed point wireless\nAnd basically all you need you don't need any lines you need a line of sight\nOkay so if there are a lot of mount or the ... mountains around you know OK okay\nSo so if they're sometimes if you have a lot of mountains that it doesn't work\nBut years ago as I I Believe it or not I live in the center of Phoenix and there who are the cable company wouldn't come down the street and I actually had to have a fixed point wireless lined put in on the roof\nThat I could go down to South Mountain from my house which I Know that doesn't mean luck to you but it's like twenty miles by the bird flies okay so uh so I Would look around to see if there's any type of six point wireless I Would also call wins stream in your area\nUh to see if they have any options for you as well you know other than that you know you don't waste your money on a booster a cause you you know these game updates could be a gig right there\n... and then I start playing you know you're you're looking at even just a movie could be three gigs and ah so you know and then and then of course you're going to have to\nTell the kids that you know there was a time\nNot too long ago when you used to walk to school on the railroad tracks\n[laughter] in the snow with no shit [laughter] exactly [laughter] so they're just kind of have to go to the library okay we'd been there at all out you need [laughter] we've tried hat [laughter]\nI could just see you you're you're you're you're like all of a sudden

sold you the rock and the guy made like two million dollars selling rocks\nSunni buying a box with a rock and yes it was I'm waiting for the punchline donor though there was a total fat okay you know as a matter of fact when I ... and I you've heard me tell a story that when I was trying to syndicated show I called this guy CBS his name was Frank Murphy Hi Frank and casual listening\nAnd Frank told me that that a show about computers in the Internet would never work because it was going to be a fad a fad like the pet rock [laughter] and I'll never forget that 'cause he said it's like a pet ... through my iPhone is just a pet rock sitting in my pocket speaker phone when's the last time you used a pay phone I don't even know do they even exist anymore\nOr I saw them in Great Britain\nOkay summer no I I've been a long time\nAnd so I was standing there it's actually quite funny 'cause I'm standing there like in front of the phone booth where there's a phone you know like in front of the phone booth were inside there's a pay phone and were you on your phone no and I was just standing there like in towards like Hi okay and in plus out laughing\nAnd I said what are you laughing at okay behind me there were all these naked women painting like on the phone booth like but their phone numbers and they found a use for the phone booth ... which is also the phone book\nBut isn't that something that's crazy yeah the phone book or the telephone operator yes the telephone technology for the longest time did not change and now we just fast forward and when when did the iPhone come out ten years ago two thousand seven\nThat was ten years prior to that it was fifty years the same old phone\nOkay did you have an Atari twenty six hundred yeah how we're all generations of video games game boys just had a game boy I say go CD game this generation I don't know anything about that no 'cause on their parents' phone\nIf they don't know anything about a road atlas\nLike a map map yeah no no that would that's good right\nYeah okay I've never I never learned how to fold up a map and I I don't think I'm gonna try now okay America on line now you know I started the computer section that America Online news you know ... years and years ago\nDo you remember when everywhere everywhere you turn around that somebody put an AOL disk and the cereal box you went to store it was everywhere that was really genius marketing right there\nBecause how they did that behind the scenes is that and I can I can talk about it now I'm sure I'm not under any more non disclosure agreement says that we'll find out Tuesday [laughter]\nThat with AOL is that if you gave a desk sometimes you'd make ten dollars at that person is that is that person used your desk to sign up for AOL you just made ten bucks\nSo we always got them from another place that doesn't exist anymore and that was blockbuster video so you're telling me when we got our Fifteen hundred free hours of AOL's blockbuster was making my yes and then they would make money every single month I mean all wow yeah it was really crazy for a\nWhile I mean this is like in the early nineties I was I was banking like ten grand a month\nJust on AOL does yeah just how are you getting them in people's hands just stand on a corner trucking about people\nYou know like I've been in a time [laughter] no I was I Would put him in like because I have\nThe computer tutor videotapes oh okay I put 'em in the videotapes and then people would use them to sign him do one day they just said we're not doing this anymore we're not paying for this any more\n[noise] yeah you know what happened is that so you know so I'm like I started the computers actually got this whole AOL thing going on okay and then they changed managers at the top right and they actually called me up\nAnd that month I had gotten and it's all numbers I've gotten like a check for twenty five grand for a lot just by people using the ... you have done it with the disc and then taken using the computer section okay and I I that I managed I mean this was my job right okay so all of a sudden\nThis guy calls me up but he says you know how like we've been paying you every month\nWell now we want you to pay us that's a bit different that's a that's a different character I said well that's not going to really work for me I don't think so I think [laughter] and so that was when\nUsing keyword commando instead of going to AOL that I mean we negotiate I negotiate that it would go to ... dot com that's when you watch the website but that is also when I learned very valuable lesson\nWe negotiate I negotiate that it would go to commando dot com that's when you watch the website but that is also when I learned a very valuable lesson\nIs not to depend upon the company\nFor the marketing of your company so that's why when Facebook came out I was so like I Am not sending anybody to Facebook because I already gotten screwed over by AOL right so why would I Do that which speaking of one last one can you make the sound of a dial up modem\n[laughter] [noise] what was that anyway [laughter] yeah one on one hand shakes that go the handshaking no ...
