yeah you wanna you wanna like I said you wanted fifty or below in the summertime you'd like to have it around forty or below in the wintertime so that those are your benchmark numbers when you say\nUm you know you don't know where the humidity's coming from my gosh you know it's water vapor so it can be coming from just about anywhere it could be coming from across space if you've got across space there it could become just from a\nYou know showers and using the dish washer and dryer and people in the house if you got a tightly sealed home and you're not using ventilation fans you could get sixty percent easily\nUh I I guess I guess my biggest thing was is\nI don't understand how they told me how the around nearby how come they don't have the same ...\nWell no well the difference would be like and I use a very simplistic not saying this is what's going on in your house but let's see in your house you had three teenage daughters\nAnd teenage daughters take showers for forty minutes right and it's usually ... and let's say they don't turn on the fan you then have a huge humidity problem but if your neighbors don't have teenage daughter's not just picking on teenage daughters but maybe there's one or two people in the house\nAnd they're real careful but always having the ventilation than on\nA for a half hour after the showers and they turned to fans on with their cooking and drivers vent it out and\nTheir houses and really a real super whether tight they don't have any humidity issue they may have a few issue but thin layer of humidity issue\nUm I guess you know if you're

walls that cetera the ants were closed up\nOkay if you're home didn't have that and your neighbors did you get the humidity issue so there's things you can do to control and knocked down the potential for having humidity issues\nI got you\nAnd I would start with the simple ones again I don't know what your status and across bases but see if that is in ...\nYou know you can eliminate any ground moisture coming up and then I'd ... really concentrate on ventilation fans within the house again\nEverybody and not everybody but most people will turn on their fan um when they share but then they turn it off it really should run by half hour after the shower for all half hour afterwards as far as the closets and stuff maybe the doors to tight to the carpet\nMaybe we need to get some ventilation in nearby either putting event in the door or shorten the door by half and so we can get some air ventilation and air\nThat closet a war zone and outside wall maybe it's a wooden house and

[laughter] that'd be great [laughter] All right let's get to a Sheri Sheri welcome\nGarry hello a question about insulating um I heard a hook up by a carpet\nIn the bedroom at about ... very call a lot of air movement underneath a house and put hardwood floor but I heard of an interesting point here in LA\nYeah it's more of a resident insulating pain it's more like a radiant barrier pain\nSo it minimizes um solar heat gain and also reduces uh kinda keeps the heat in the room it's usually a ceramic based paint\nA reflective I'm so they're so there's some marginal benefit to it um I'm not saying it's but it's not really an insult later it's it's more of a\nSecond ... it's like you're kind of creating a thermostat bottle if you will\nRight right okay and what's underneath that wood floor\nUm it's\nAn open space it storage like at eight and\nIs it a basement or is it across space\n... that they ...\nIt is okay so just the tip here is just be\nIs it a basement or is it across space and I think that it is okay\nSo just the tip here is just the cautious of uh what take humidity level was in their basement last times basement crawl spaces tend to be a little bit more damp\nThan the rest of the how it uh-huh so getting the ... okay go do very very good All right okay oh scary All right Jerry thanks for the call they get their ... ... ... Mike welcome story force\nI of acting too because we just made a commercial you and I sometime ago a chair and Williams about back pain the inflating paint oh okay okay yeah\nBut this story is about a half a friend of mine bought a long time ago in the states have enough votes junk\nThat one room in the basement and he happened to notice all the sticker saying he's getting ready to get rid of it and he couldn't imagine why they had these Sacred Heart stickers on all of these pictures and can you know a based aren't open them and everyone would still with silver certificate no yeah you almost pay for his whole house\nNo yeah it was that one of those are typically gets its silver certificates were really valuable because now I don't think they are as valuable as they were maybe twenty five years ago\nThis has been every bit of thirty thirty five\nYear oh my gosh and how many boxes of these scans the fine\n... a ball he found thousands of dollars worth an actual money yeah and and so and at the house was in bad shape so I mean the house with a low cost but he\n... he was gonna say he's got a bigger remodeling budget now has a great story Mike thanks very very good how 'bout that [laughter] Martin welcome Gary ...\nGot a disturbing story here about a find a it happened here in our local area of Dr been accused of abusing children ...\nAnd no evidence I mean there were many complaints I think it was even cried never convicted as far as I remember this was quite a few years ago mhm he passed away in house assault\nAnd I forget how many times how can I can and finally somebody decided three model the basement and same thing there appear to be a whole fall though boy they cut into it and I'll\nCall all the you know all the ... why\nIs that right yeah yeah and he was long gone with long he was already paying the price you\nKnow a good story there's a lot of things that uh I think are hidden in a lot of homes in some homes\nI told the story about just a crazy light switch story of my home which I still can't get over that we never knew this which was there and we were involved in building a house but uh yeah secrets or certainly stored in homes and when you buy a home and you start moving in a home uh people do find\nSome odd things that were going on or maybe just the things that you didn't expect to find so they've got a story like that shared it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five\nGot a question regarding your home sure you can calls also at eight hundred eighty two three to five but\nNot a bad time either to be thinking we ... we started off the show we were talking about maximus lighting and then we went into we started talking about are all kinds of things for your home chimneys chimney repair also not a bad idea\nSome time in the next week or to get up and that attic\nTake a look at your insulation\nI just do a quick addict inspection maybe if you get a furnace up in the attic and their handler but when that guy comes to take care of that problem are going to give it its annual maintenance give me a yardstick and just say around there just just double checking them much inflation I have up there and\nAgain you can find with the department of energy a recommends for every inch it insulation it's usually like in our three and just being very general but if the department of energy saying in our forty two\nOr you might find out you got some work you need to do to make that home as efficient as you can but that's one of the things you can put on your list or to get done and again as I speak about often\nThere's no vapor barrier in other words there's a vapor beyond the bottom peace in the living quarters which is what's supposed to happen but if there's no vapor bearing on the top which there should not be\nA double blind insulation with a vapor berry you don't want to have vapor barrier in the middle of the insulation\nThat's important\nThat's how you can trap water in the insulation we don't want to do that so\nIf you have um\nFiberglass inflation with a vapor barrier vapor barrier facing down the house question I get asked often is can I add right on top of that and the answers absolutely you can blow it in you can buy bats are just don't put any vapor barrier in between the two\nUm pieces of insulation that's where you get in trouble and don't cover up all that soften vending around your house or maybe even get baffles if you don't have them where you can keep that insulation from blowing over uh the suffered fence so\nThat is a little tip for you and not a bad time of year to kind of inspected and see what's going on along with just seeing what kind of shaped all your ah weather stripping Jim\nAll right we're going to take a break in a bubble put you on hold we'll give you the

[noise]\n\n\n\nAll the holidays are just around the corner and it's time to take a look around your house but inside and out and see what you can freshman up ugly counter tops old towel annoying for did you know you can do it yourself\nIt it insulated I could see an area where I'm Talking about underneath the you know the joy the floor and the paper facing is on the outside but it's all covered over with\nTar paper ball in the insulation mhm so is that grade up all\nWell no I don't think it would be um how sick is that insulation ... it's not over three inches thick is it\nI couldn't tell I live now without training they sitar paper\nThat cross faces a giant that can be okay\nThere is more than a ... they were putting a basement under house ran into Iraq there's more than a foot crash rock on the floor some plastic walls had been painted sealed with something\nAnd three sides in this house the ground soaps away from it anyway so\nIt sounds like you've got a really good situation but you're just a little concerned about their wallpaper or tar paper\nRight right is this meeting\nAnd here's what I Would say about this you ever hear the phrase don't fix it if it's an are broken\nAbsolutely have to leave in it so do I. [laughter] so that's been functioning\nAnd you've had no moisture as you would have you with a a problem with moisture you their problem with mold\nAnd you've experienced none of that my guess is if you ... if you double vapor barrier and insulated wall and you don't extend beyond three inches of insulation you're not going to have a problem\nOf them I guess as you probably go you know two three inches of insulation yet the toilet paper it's not cause we're on the issue at all you gotta you gotta be for beer on the outside part of that so there's probably no vapor getting in between in any way\nWell here's the other thing this house has been reminded when I bought it carpet had been down they tore the carpet up I had the floors rate than east they're beautiful every board no space no you know there there's no sign of moisture ever affecting that it's it's red oak flooring\nAnd I felt like if there was moisture on that under the house\nYou would have had problems with the wood floor I think it would it in in ...\nYou would have okay it's the canary in the mine let me tell you that would float would react to a high water content for sure\nOkay great oh and by the way they're your to your house story um there's two houses ones in Hamilton one in every town here when they were tearing these houses down they found log cabin and\nOne of the cabins them on and liberty township sits on the corner of liberty Fairfield rabbit in Princeton well maintained\nSo they build a house over a cabin\nYeah these are old house is one of them was in the city limits are I think it's up by the high mainstream fringe Napoli that's why they made this fund and the other one I don't know who owns this ground but it's so neat guy by that intersection and it's just staying there a couple of great big old trade buy\nA house had been built around our over the world are cabins yeah I mean these people were you know it's a big write up in the paper because you expect to find that law\nWell
