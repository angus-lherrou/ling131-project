K. R. A. C. K.\nK. O. piece of crack ... with the case that product is designed specifically for\nI'm making repairs to all plastered walls and it can be used on drywall sheet rock as well um but it's a it's designed to be in the last ... patch that will move with the wall as little as the whole houses we tend to move\nIn that plaster and very flexible by the way yeah exactly exactly but the problem\nIs those walls that over somebody rams adore and one of those old houses or they\nFind the windows shut too hard and and that plaster disagrees with that ends up splitting\nOpen and correct coated is a product that specifically designed to make a flexible repairs to crack so rather than filling it in with a\nJoint compound or something that gets rock hard yeah great cracked code is a it's an acrylic with a polyester mash and use those two items together and you're actually create a bridge over the top of that crack and that bridge\nFlexible with the wall um if somebody comes through and slammed the door again so this is going to hide the crack it's gonna it's gonna cover that up and it's going to prevent that crack from reappear again\nYeah that's a product that's been around a while and the restoration businesses that available and local hardware stores to\nA well that is also available to to the age distribution sort of ask your ah your locally going to get that in for you\nThey don't

like a like a ... compound or you're going to use it as basically like a like a ...\nI was going to sing and like he has run yeah\nOkay yeah see so so the process is pretty simple your your brush on the the acrylic to the size of the crack\nYou lay your fabric into that wet acrylic and then you feather it out and so it's similar to mugging and taping right um but uh but it's going to be a dinner mixtures a sinner a that's a great in polyester bash non doesn't pop off the walls you're not going to see it\nI'm not going to create like a glaring repair on some of the sticker fiberglass mashed

sir fine\nAnd great I I'm a quick question I I'm treated my guy or a stain my back with a semi transparent\nA Sherman Williams' product mhm uh authority shown some ... uh where my question has can I go dark or what the darker Spain and just go over the stain that still remains or does it does it have to be completely stripped off\nSo what type of thing did you use what it was a semi transparent was water\nBase water base semi transparent mhm um\nYeah and uh so and places obviously were traffic is it's it's kind of worn three couldn't would ... um but I I didn't want to go darker man I I was wondering I don't think paint I I I'm not sure that pain while at here over the stain\nYeah it will um you got a couple of choices are number one um if you use a solid color stain\nUm that we'll hear and will cover it up it will also give you saw a color stain it gives you a different look some people don't like that painted look which is what song ... give you on the other hand it will last longer because there's more you be blocking\nUm material inside that\nUh which will help out dramatically\nOr if you're going to go to a darker semi trends parent I Would use the strip or on there and it will help you in in two ways it'll give you a uniform color in a darker because remember that\nThe Senate print that's going down in basically tempting the wood fiber so we want to get that off and a lot of the strippers or you know fairly easy to use it the added benefit of that is using a stripper opens up\nThe wood fiber who would do it absorbs more stain which will make a semi transparent last longer\nOkay but what I'm thinking as I Want to do a color through a stain so ... and I'm going much darker it's really like color mhm and so I'm going to go much darker so I don't think I I don't know what do you think it is it going to show some a differential and color even though it's it's completely darker\nUm how long has it been on there\nIt's only been on for a couple of years and when I say light it's like a almost color team yeah it's almost like a team like a real white a real white blond caller okay and I'm going to go much much darker I'm going with like a force brown ...\nOkay again these are both semi trends parents correct\nWell I think I Want to go with a caller drew a\nWhen you say color through you're talking about are all like color\nYeah yeah colored staying um\nOh if you use a set of my tramp yeah fuses sound color staying I wouldn't strip put it all your funny they might have okay that that's not I just wanted to make sure that was going to hear it will hurt Willie now though\nNow having said that yes it will it here solid color stains are\nI'm I'm\n... you want to make sure that there is ... it's not that the stain that's on there's going to play a big part of\nNot letting it here but the more we can open up the wood fibers to get that water base solid color stain to bite the better off you are so I wouldn't necessarily worry about stripping it but what I Would use is when you go back to get that there'll be a wood bright and they're\nAnd they're also be a wood cleaner I Will\n... cleaner I I've already cleaner ... brush\nThem with the cleaner Iran a power washed it\nOkay and then go back and just some jak brighten or ... solid gas that just opens up the pores a little bit more just to offer just just helps you with that at
