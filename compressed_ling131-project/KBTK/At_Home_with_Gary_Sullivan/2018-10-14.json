B. blaster with white lithium Greece for a time release penetrating action the bus Ross with lasting lubrication protection it's perfect for equipment and friction surfaces including trailer hitch his employees\n... ... a\n... ours system itself will check to see how leaky the doctor\nBefore and after type comparison when they hook up the machine and they can run a test\nTo see what they charge it and you know like a blower door to us for a house\nIt's a it's kind of like what's called the duct blaster tests to similar okay I'm ... different dealers approach it differently and you know what they may or may not charge for that\nBut there's other ways Gary I mean you I can walk around my house you can walk around your house\nAnd just use your eyes to look for signs of duck linkage it's really it's really pretty easy to find right happy and I talked to my my mom and my sister about it and that they were able to just walk around and find evidence that oh gosh I could have what kind of evidence they find\nWell one of the easiest of course you mentioned that right when we began to the segment here in it and a lot of people think it's normal\nFor that that far room to be colder than the rest of\nThe how old is normal it's Ninety five percent of the way we keep [laughter] formal Zach right right\nBut um but if you're that system is designed properly and working the way in the post you and you've got a good working piece of equipment and that's not supposed to happen mhm yep ninth even temperatures throughout your house there's you're on telltale sign and got a\nA ... you know the big one that's where I knew it\nYeah on the grill or the register maintenance I before I before I was in this industry I thought that was just a normal thing but that's kind of what we call infiltration meaning your ducked can actually be pulling air\nLike a vacuum exactly left and right into the halls of the joints right right and I don't want to breathe that in mind that game I don't know about you yeah so then they said but I got a filter on my furnace it's all after the filter and that's right that's right so it's kind of sucking in distributing that inflation all over your house\nThat's right okay and then I think the other big telltale sign that you you also mentioned is that a lot of homeowners will by higher efficiency\nFurnaces are any fees and expect to be a big energy saving a but then they really don't they really don't get that benefit they don't see it and I you know what's happening ran are not getting the the savings and it's probably because there is some kind of efficiency drain like Lincoln\nYeah and I I'll tell you in ... maybe you agree with me maybe you want but if you just give you a basement in your home\nAnd you just kind of look at the duck work in the basement in between the Joyce\nAnd you see gaps in I mean you kind of see what kind of duck work system you have because you remember him for the most part the duck work we can see is in the advocates no walls in places we can't get too but the basement you can see it and when I started looking into it myself before a cold\nOr checked into the air seal um I started looking at this stuff work is a mess\nAnd I'm getting up there with silicone I'm getting there was aluminum tape and I started taking all these up in a one then I had this a ha moment and said\nWow this is just a basement wonder what's going on inside of why I Can't see what's inside the wall\nExactly I lately agree with you and you're you're right a with a quick examination of the part that you can see right it can be representative of oh my gosh what's behind the wall and the addict what the right you're right\nSo I had a company come out and they did the test with the air I think they stopped a closed the registers put little\nWhatever they put over shut them off shut them down and they tested the pressure so I had a forked on air conditioner in front of the sport and they were able to measure how much air I was getting through that duct work\nWhat most people get you know yeah I mean I I knew what my status was but is it twenty five percent fifty percent on average\nYeah on average it it's probably going to be in that twenty five to forty percent rain\nMine was twenty five so it was a fork than you think about this folks there's four tons and I was ... one time heir\nAmazing yeah you're not getting much paid for yeah I mean that's amazing yeah only five percent of the law yeah so it was like I really have a two and three ton you into was too small for the house I mean you could look at it that way yet when they were finished\nIt was one sixteenth of a tone I was missing because we're one area I Can't remember what the issue was once sixteenth of a ton\nThey were in both from the testing and the application and it was three quarters of the day after day I Can't remember what the full day at ... and that's how it and so tell me what they use an error I I I ... it's almost like an aerosol and it\nYeah so uh you know the fancy chemical named the vinyl acetate polymer but that nobody knows what the heck that is right to non toxic components at the same ... going to find and things like chewing gum\nA baby pacifier is it completely safe and it's a liquid to begin with our system he turns it into an\nAerosol and then that just like the guys that at your house they'll block off all the registers so that that that fits in as close as often that candy ... aerosol through the digestive system as I described before they'll find a\nLittle hole where where the air and leaking out the island not from the outside and move on down the trunk line them up until they're all sealed\n... now so we know what some of the benefits are going to be we'll talk about him but I'm sure everybody listening is like a cost and I know that's probably over all over the board but gee you know what the return on investment is do you recoup that in two years three years five years or [noise]\nYeah and and again that that does very for sure uh across the country but um most homeowners are going to see a return within about three years three years yeah\nWere you you return to comfort immediately\nWell that's true I mean I can attest to that the other way to look at it in\n... in some respect your already spending that money mhm right to heat and cool you're home mhm a
