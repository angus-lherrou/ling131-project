E. D. silver minted vintage bald\nUm so it has a mere fact it's L. E. D. it has a standard base to it a runs about twelve bucks Thirteen bucks and uh it's on Amazon\nAnd it's made by like I said look all male you XO when so for those that are searching we've had two options now for reading or actually three I I I talked about the woman option which\nWas the real bright G. E. ball called reveal and then we had the tubular ball which was LAPD which is about five six inches long about an inch in diameter and now we have the looks on half chrome light bulb which is called her readers bald so there's a multiple options for you there\nAre All right eight hundred eighty two three eight to five five that's our number Anna welcome\nHow good\nThe reason I'm calling is I just moved into a prank uh finally have my own home and odd that the place is a much older place and in desperate need of some little\nBrushing up um ... it's a ... ... what I'm wanting to do in the kitchen and all of the cabinet are very hidden or design it looks like they may have actually been getting a call or a\nComplementary and divine but over the years for how on earth some of them are state one color and another color and from that Ben\n...\nAnd I wanted to do what I Want to do is I Want to make them uniform again and cover by um scrapping them down with some things that I can pay down um both physically or a black black her lawyer\nAnd I and I need to know what can I Do to a ... used to be able to trip all the grease residue and then ... and everything so that I can paint and not have to worry about killing the\nWell preparation certainly key and you said the ... the wonderful word and I called paint because pain makes your job a lot easier um because when you have paint your coverage\nInto the woods so\nYeah no I Know I I I Want a uniform look and I figured that hate it when it went even out it would give us the best kind a uniform texture throughout all the defending cap and trade that I I don't think I'd be able to have the patience for stone [laughter]\nSo well there's a lot of work if you're going to try and bring them all back so what are we we we can't find you have like a garage where you could take a maybe the cabinet doors to\nYeah yeah that's that's what I'm planning on doing a great great great and and\nPlay it all out on on on a plywood or whatever that I can work in a well ventilated area\nYeah so the first thing I Would do is I Would take all my handles off and different things along those lines\nUm I Would start the whole process by you know simply cleaning the cabinets um just to remove even wiping it down like with a paint dinner or something along those lines were to remove a lot of the cooking Greece and different things at that point a\n... and then I Would likely sand you don't have to knock yourself out there but just lightly saying scratch up the surface if there's any clear protect it like a ... year thing um you would you would create a good\nBlond double surface so cleaning with mineral spirits\nComing back to lightly sanding and then I Would just use a good primer\nAnd oil base primer and probably in\nYour recommend isn't you know either or you could go either or so you don't have to use your grandmother's\nTrying to tell me and now that that the and now I'm In it or is it that\nWell then it wasn't prepared properly and that that's just not the effect that I Want\nRight it wasn't prepared properly paint peels there's two things going on you either didn't prepared properly to create good binding\nTo the surface or um there's moisture involved\nUm so you do like I said you wipe it down with a mineral spirits you come back in you lightly sand it so all the surfaces a scratched up and you know ready to go then you use a good\nInterior a enamel over that and it doesn't have to be an oil base they Benjamin Moore has a wonderful renewable that can be used inside that is a water base\nIn fact if I'm not mistaken it's a combination of a water in oil which I Can't even explain how that works and then they have are matching primer forward so preparation is the key clean sand\nCrime in pain now when you paint you said you wanted a real leak you know kind of lost look\nWhy I I I think a lot of that would be affected by this than they are to make sure some of the doors were the handles are um they obviously are dirty hands greasy and whatever and then the scrapping it it it job peeled off the varnish and their barren what their ... and\nThat's fine but again the or the worst thing is to take off the handles\nThen clean then saying in prime and if you get the handles often you get a good bond above surface you're ready to go this secret though is if you have him clean you got your primer you got a good interior enamel\nThan the secret is to get a really good brush\nAnd I'm not talking about three dollar dialogue brush\nIf you get oil based paint you want a pure bristle brush if you get a water base in a water base combination water oil base\nEnamel then you want a good polyester brush and following those steps I'm telling you you get a good finished but\nDo not cheat on the preparation and not the cleaning and that's the same thing and that's the primary that's the key to success of your project will continue your at home\nWe are always just a

think of it sounds and you hit a leak and you didn't know it and the it rots out and everything\nNo we don't want to do it but it's probably not the end of the world it is terrible it's you know like space shuttle here [laughter] I mean you can get it and you can can repair it\nI'd be comfortable with the ... cream washer um\nI don't think I Would use the silicone unless I was really certain\nThat that wasn't going to compromise or the need for him\nAnd I'm not as good will compromise some types of products like that\nYeah and I I I'm not certain that it won't to you and that's why I thought I'd give you a call at five years from now that's one thing if it fails a week from now after I get the whole thing put together that would be kind of\nI Would say that near pretty more should be good

talking to you was the next year you're I'm\nLike a house paint which is some more I mean they didn't like Hermeto\nOkay okay well um that that may be the ticket I guess I I Would go this way um if if you've got\nRust and you've got some peeling that's the first thing we need to take care of\nA we have to remove the peeling paint we have to send it where it's moods where you can kind of feather edge the new code of pain and we have to remove the Ross by sending that offer a wire brushing that I Would if you're not going to prime the whole thing I Would certainly use\nA metal primer to the Baird areas where I remove the ah peeling paint and were removed the rust from it I Would use\nA metal primer whether you use the a gray Russ stole a metal primer or use a another brand of primer I'm fine but just make sure it's designed to be put on metal\nAfter we have that um I think you can get into a couple of different things in there there there's a lot of good water base in ... for

about wall paper that the themes are are began to split or turn there's there's a way to treat\nThose sure sure is a paper check or is it a little vinyl\nOr think of all over the boat I got a free rooms are doing it\nFrom oh okay um\nSo so it's been on for a while\nYeah yeah what about Twenty years okay yeah so what happens over time is like everything else in our homes you know over the absorbs moisture dries out absorbs moisture dries up and the weakest part is the theme and all like paper when it gets old\nIt dries out and begins to curl so there isn't it he's a cold seem at ease of wallpaper seem ... which will glue it down but we have to re hydrate the paper so what you\nDo is get a um a even a dish ragged cotton rag uh put warm water on it a ring it out so it shows up in just\nIf it's vinyl you're gonna have to get on the part that's curling up because it's not going to allow the water to go through the bottle so the underneath part it it it will absorb so that moisture and\nIt'll hydrate it to a point where it becomes pliable bits of paper you can just lay it right on the top so therefore we hydrated in that paper becomes pliable we can run the seem adhesives\nOr on the wall not much depends on how much it's girl but really doesn't take much\nAnd then again you'll take a warm damp cloth and you'll pull that paper back down and give it to lay flat you're probably going to hit the hold there for a while and then allow that seem and he's a to dry and grab\nWe've been doing this for thirty eight years in North central Arizona with our stores in
