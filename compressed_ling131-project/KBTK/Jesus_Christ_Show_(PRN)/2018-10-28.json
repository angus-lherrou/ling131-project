Hi James I'm well sir quickly we only have in a moment a moment herself here okay\nYes I was just wondering why should we you know promote evil holidays\nAnd give it a bad example to the kids\nOkay well I I think that's a legitimate question what would you say about the Halloween holiday which really is a derivative of a Christian holiday all saints day and not necessarily style when the ... the Celtic festival which preceded them\nBut there is more mutation of all saints day and all Hallows eve uh which came from the Christians so what part of Halloween you find to be evil\nWell that's in light and everybody's got these\nWell we'll ... we'll\nWhy would why would be in the Knight why would something in the night the evil\nBecause that's what people celebrate you know\nSo if you're not necessarily there were many pagan rituals that were in the morning so if you go to church at night that's evil\n\nNot necessarily okay so anything you do at night is evil not necessarily okay so why is the evil in this case\n'cause all this evil mask and all and\nOkay so uh what would be an evil mask\nOr the ... you could go out there and see yourself while he's the master worrying\nOkay are there some non evil masks very few okay but there are some you\nOkay so you're saying if they were in ... evil mask and maybe go out at dusk before it gets too dark it's okay\nBut the point is that a pretty much we're following you know taken holiday\nNo actually it's not any more that's that's the true point is that it's not anymore and if anything if you could imagine an old decay building that was used as a as a you know uh selling crack or something James that has been repainted in re fixed up to be something that is more productive in better\nThan that should be honored it's not about what it used to be it's about what it can become and that that really is on the shoulders of the Christian parent\nOr your direct their children in the proper way but really saying because the night is silly or because they're evil masks you can change the evil mass things and certainly not everything at night is evil\nWow to the um [noise]\nWow wow\nWow\nThey go oh yeah oh\nYeah a\nJesus Christ sure will return in a moment to be a part of a show called seven seven hours and\nI'm like oh\n[noise]\nI'm a that is a filled every single day with creativity with exploration with curiosity and um for instance it says in scripture to pray without ceasing and truly it's it's it doesn't mean nonstop like a ...\nUm it it means kind of like an incessant cough\nIt means always be in that state of knowing that God is there and that you're thinking about God and that's kind of what you do with everything and and if you partake in something Charlie where you feel like how can I bring got into this and it doesn't quite work than maybe that's something that you want to not do\nIn your life yeah um yes I\nI had a question about like what about like uh gone to the like scary movies I mean it doesn't affect me like I don't\nThink it's like ... ... not giving already God like if I were to go the movies\nWell it's what the purpose is there are many scary parts to scripture and I know that movies to picked a you know angels and demons is\nParticular types of creatures but if you saw a good angel um it would creep you out at first the concept it's not the single pair of wing some angels have multiple pairs and wings or on their feet on their shoulders on their backs and\nThere are things that would be quite frightening as a matter of fact there are times in scripture where uh people were frightened of good angels or a godly experiences if you put scripture on camera and on film in a very articulate in legitimate way\nAh there would be\nHorrible sex scenes there would be horrible scenes of violence there would be scary things there would be exciting things so really it's not about those things in general there's a whole psychology that surrounds the concept of\nA fear and why people like to be afraid to get scared when it's ... and that's why they go on roller coasters\nI'm a scary movie within reason\nOr is no different than going on a roller coaster or experiencing something else that would give you a thrill but it's the context of what's being done and\nThe divider really is if something's prescribing you to do something\nBad then you're not a part of it but if something is describing something bad then that's\nJust a description of things that are taking place or something that is a causing you to think about the way the world works or things like that so different people go see them for different reasons some people see them because they're movie buff sudden they're fascinated by the concept of\nSpecial effects or um the storyline or lately like the thrill of not knowing what's coming next but you could say that about a lot of things that\nYou know some people would think urban nine or ... you know some people think a Stephen King novels okay but uh uh Freddy Krueger movie is not or you know and go back and forth in these concepts\nHaving said that Charlie there are some things that really focus and are done by people with with dark intent\nAnd really focus on evil things and in that case ah I Would use grape discernment as to whether you were bringing those images were those thoughts are those concepts into your life\nOr you have to decide where that line is where you\nUm because like many things there are specific\nCommandments I'm\nAn admonitions by God that are for everyone don't ... don't murder don't steal these types of things and then there are ones that are specifically for you for the alcoholic they can't drink period that becomes a new commandment in their life\nBecause any drinking becomes a cent whereas someone who's having wine with dinner or something it's not necessarily a sin so uh with you you may have a tolerance for certain films because you like the genre\nWhereas for someone else it could be a problem because of tendencies in their life for things that excites them in a way that a shouldn't or things like that and you have to just be honest with yourself as to why why you explore those things while you're curious about\nThem are you a a horror fan buff\nI I Am I just I like to watch with my friends like the last time I mean I I don't ever really get by on that\nI have a friend who think that it ... or find I don't know [laughter]\nWell some may be and that's it that's a decision you're gonna have to make as you look at them there have been some\nUm no I don't think they're going to throw you into the arms of the devil if you're a Christian and that is that is your faith in a on the contrary may make you run closer to God but these things are are judgment calls on your own to say all things\nThat deal with violence or ugliness or a different spirituality or in our bad\nWould really put\nYou know everything aside think about the uh the the Christian police officer who is in crime scene investigations as to how among actual scenes of these things every day\nOr see even ritual lipsticks killings or things like that does that mean that that that that they would cut that out of their job and say I can't go on those it depends what the purpose of these things are and\nTo where they are uh and if you're using them for good and how you're applying them if you think that it's something it's become too you know it's kind of a rite of passage of passage for for men a lot of um see these things and and kind of a lot of gallows humor and laugh at the things that are there are nuts and to build a\nPassage for for men a lot of them see these things and and kind of a lot of gallows humor and laugh at the things that are there are nuts and to build a a a thick skin and establish yourself into manhood and things like that and the part of the warrior process\nAnd that can be fine if it becomes an infatuation or something\nYou know that you're in that that you're getting just totally caught up in the cob and then you gotta check yourself a little bit fair enough yeah I think\nYou're very welcome it doesn't mean that every single thing that deals with the ... oh my gosh I'm throwing out all my Tim Burton stuff or any of these things it's just it's not fair to the concept of\nA a different types of literature and art and they'll make you there is many types of uh art\nUh paintings or otherwise that could be considered a cop that are quite brilliant and wonderful and uh insightful\nAnd that goes for movies as well but you have to use the discernment if it starts to become a thing\nThat maybe you should check a check yourself every once in a while being perspective about it\nPreying on it and uh and I think that way\n\n\nBy\nJesus
