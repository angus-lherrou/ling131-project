check that out there\n\nYou know Murray in her pain talking about not understanding\n\nAnd I want you to once you know not understanding somebody in that mind set is a good thing it's good that you don't understand why evil people do evil things when I say evil people it's not about there is no evil\nPerson evil thing per se but it's the choices that somebody makes that create that evil\nAnd I I'm Glad you don't understand that I Hope to have that that you don't understand that I wanted to be foreign to you\n\nTo understand it is just somehow somehow know that it's part of you\nAnd as you get further along as you as you press yourself\nInto the will of God and allow\nGod's will to motivate you and your decisions closer you get the gods the more of the world that will ensure confused you\n\nMore of the world that should scene foreign and bizarre\nThat may sound strange but that's the truth you see to a child there ways are normal\nBut when you get older and you look back at the things you did as a child don't you look back at them and go wow that really wow\nThat is different I was just not thinking yes your you're just thinking with a five year old brain or six year old brain did you grow\nIn your face you'll do the same you will grow in a way where you will continue to look back at yourself and seeing that gross notice how far you were off the Mark Pryor and you'll do that with the world as well you see how far they are away from being in the will of God\nIt's part of your gross that's\nPart of you becoming truly a new creation and Christ you should expect and when the world starts to make the least amount of sense\nYou'll know that you are at the closest point of knowing me\nUh\nI'm ... and a\n[noise]\nIs although your um this is a family member\nYeah I'm more than a lot of the three people or we don't live near them they're all all of a a another\nFaith okay well I Love your statement earlier that we are truth seekers absolutely that really\nAre out there that have made an impact\nOtherwise who cares then then no one's right when you can you can both be wrong but you can't be right the purpose of truth scripture throughout you see things where people say God is love absolutely but God is truth and it's not some false truth it's not you know the truth is relative all of that is garbage\nTruth is not relative truth is truth\nThey that statement doesn't even make any sense\nSo there if there is truth it's absolute truth if there's absolute truth you know it and you can learn it and you can live at so\nWhen you're talking about um first Corinthians chapter one versus Nineteen although this is where it was quoted from I Will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the ... of the clever I Will set aside its really quoting\nThe Old Testament I said twenty nine fourteen\nThat's white starts starts with Ford has written\nIt's referencing eyes is so it's good to know both as a a twenty nine fourteen and this reference to know its context in both places it's not talking about mainstream academia it's talking about the religious leaders of the day in ... was talking about um\nUh Jews that were\nLike worshipping inexperienced seeing and going through their daily practice worshipping God but never really knowing God there are ways ... wisdom to themselves religiously so in both context it's not talking about mainstream academia it's talking about religious academia\nIt's talking about those that say this is the right way to worship\nStrangely enough it ties more into your conversation than not a meaning that the ... the religious folks that will get caught up in the religion of something\nFor instance and this is not to pick on anybody I'm at all and I know that there's debate within the church about the age of the universe or the age of the earth rather\nWell that five thousand which is not even I'm a what a young earth what they refer to as young earth creationist believe it's ... it's round six but\nThat is based upon um that is based upon genealogy and scripture that are not even complete\nSo the assumption is well these genealogy would roughly you know roll up to about this time so that's got to be the beginning of the earth when it never says that in scripture anyway it never make that statement this is the age of the earth anywhere\nYou have people come to that conclusion and they'll stand on it and not have any leeway and on this program and we say this a lot it is in the essential Z unity there's no way bringing the essentials on this program ever so in the central unity\nIn the non essential liberty\nAnd all things charity so in the essentials who do you say that I Am the trinity the resurrection the virgin birth you don't mess around with these things\nSalvation through grace by faith through faith by grace and these things don't mess with them that is what makes a Christian and Christian but the things about like the age of the earth\nThat's not a mandate if he wants to believe that that's fine but that's not a mandate that's something you\nTalk about an inhouse discussion so the scripture really is not an appropriate one to use as a matter of fact Paul is the one writing this Paul was incredibly educated\nVery well educated but even goes on to say if you continue to read um in Corinthians or he goes on to talk about a\n... that he wasn't using that in this context and ... says and when I came to your brother and I did not come up with the pure you're already a speech or of wisdom claiming to you the testimony of God\nFor I determine or to no nothing among you accept Jesus Christ and him crucified he was putting aside academia too too focused primarily on the gospel but not putting in a way for good it's not that didn't have any purpose because they use that later\nBut uh he says and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling\nMeaning that it's at the base level of understanding and not just at this place where um he's parsing everything but just knowing the simplicity and the beauty of the gospel he goes on to say in my message and my preaching were not per a persuasive\nWords of wisdom\nBut in demonstration of the spirit of the power\nThat your faith should not rest on wisdom of man but on the power of God so this is an argument about faith there's going to be a place where faith and reason meat absolutely safe on this show we talk about faith being that which comes after reason or when you can't reason anymore\nYou know you look at a uh a chair Jay and you can reason okay it looked structurally sound it looks like it's made out of what looks like it's bolted together it looks like it'll hold my weight that's reasoning when you sit on it that's faith\nThat everything you just reasoned is true and you are perceiving it properly\nAnd then it's going to be applied properly but its face when you sit in that or you test those that reasoning that's how they're married together and what Paul is doing here I'm In its fullness of context\nThe ... were you test those that reasoning that's how they're married together and what Paul is doing here I'm In its fullness of context is trying to explain to listen if you try and get so waiting\nAnd you try and just use wisdom you may get the point right but you missed the flavor of it it's like trying to dissect music or art now there's the law of search\nAnd that beauty comes from the last surge meaning that the the face is separating the surge and when it's balanced in those a church Sherry points it's more beautiful but the body when it's a metric has more beautiful and you can look at those things but truly it doesn't define beauty\nAnd that's what it's saying that you can't define\nUm the beauty of scripture and the gospel and salvation just academically and that if you go down that path you're gonna you're you're going to have the first part of knowledge just the simple knowledge but you won't have true wisdom which is the application of knowledge in proper context and that you missed the point altogether\nAnd that's what's being said I don't go to school or education is bad but that's a night that doesn't help anybody\nThat's not that's not going to help you you're not going to help anybody does then you don't learn and they had to learn scripture and they had to be written and I had to be written in the language they understood\nAnd all of these things that come from academics\n\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm\nWhy are there are so many songs about rainbow [noise] you know what all the other side
