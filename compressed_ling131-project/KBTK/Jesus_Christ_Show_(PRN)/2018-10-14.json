Matthew work and I think this uh all also in Luke uh Eighteen sixteen where it says suffered little children in forbid them not to come to me for such as the kingdom of heaven and people look at that and say\nObviously a Christ is talking there about the children being in heaven um and this is an argument that goes back and forth this is a place where really states come in and you have to trust that when uh the ugliness of something like a child dying takes place that a God\nGod has a way of balancing these things out that really accountability and salvation is based on acceptance rejection not ignorance and that's where the confusion sometimes lies\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWell ... ... ... ... ... um\nMm Mm Mm\nMm\nNo no\nNo no\nThey show will return on them all that\nTo be a part of the show called it's seven seven we\n[noise]\n\nI felt that you know God was talking to them you know I think it just was really strange thing to go through\nWhat was he saying\nUm [noise] you were saying to let this go you were saying don't harbour any guilt it wasn't my fault you know I was a child and I and I didn't rescue him I I panic\nBut you know you didn't have the ability to rescue him\nRight again\nSo it can't be your fault\nRight and I and I it took a long time to to realize that it wasn't my fault and but you know just to let it go I mean just to say goodbye to him um to pray for him and\nI I I don't know it was just a really difficult thing to go through and being a paramedic I'm seeing people around a bit on the other side of it too um there was a really strange thing\nI Want you to take all those the physical things in in seen some lose their life obviously very potent scripture says do not fear those that can kill the flesh but those that can kill the spirit and I want you to think about all those people that are grounding spiritually every single day because no one wants to do anything about it they're embarrassed to share their faith\nOr whatever it might be and the situation you're describing is that you immediately grew into a person who said you know what I Want to know what to do and became a paramedic\nWhich you witnessed with your daughter was is you know the symbolism of of baptism is the death in the burial\nDisruption as they come up out of the water and I think all of that that imagery is very powerful but what you do with it is up to you ... you know the same knife you may use free tracheotomy an emergency tracheotomy is the uh it's a nice that can be used to kill somebody\nAnd just to not put value a positive or negative on these things the water the knife to any of these things but to see them as a proper usage and improper usage and what you got you've got to see both in the same body of water\nAnd you got to see both sides of the beauty of that water and the power of that water in the sense of that it could take a life\nUm but to dwell on it or somehow I'm a ... weigh you down when it's obviously been a a you know positive or productive in your life piece of your life because you've taken it and said I'm going to do something good with it you have to let you have to let the power of that lake\nOr the mystery of the lake go away you don't have to forget what took place there you don't forget what you've learned they're going to forget the life\nUm but you couldn't do anything and guilt is irrelevant it doesn't mean anything has no benefit in this particular case and I think that you should enjoy the beauty of what your daughter went through and that should be a significant part of your like equally as significant\nAs the death that you witnessed because if you really believe what it says in scripture\nIt says that the fear is not in the flesh being laws\nBut spirit being lost and so you were able to sit there and watch your daughter come into a new life in Christ and that's a very powerful and wonderful thing and I'm Sorry that you went through that experience but it's obvious that it has done something and meant something in a way\nThat has become very very productive in your life that glorifies guy the other gives the enemy total foothold\n\nDale welcome to the Jesus Christ show hello Jesus I Do\nI'm I'm a\nFirst time caller I have listened a for quite some time I'm well welcome how can I help you\nI uh was married
