I don't know\nBut you know every day out every day you experienced things you use face every day\nAnd let me explain this is what a lot of people in the church won't tell you they want you to believe that faces this thing where you just jump off every moment that you don't ask questions that you don't wait for answers you just do it and that's what faith is and that's not\nFace is\nThat portion that you can't know no matter what you do you can't know it\nAnd that exists in life so Ninety percent you know and you should know and you should learn and study ask questions but there's going to be a percentage Gary there's gonna be a part that you can't know for instance you look at a chair\nAnd you trust your eyes and you say my eyes say that's a chair my eyes say that that's a would share my belief is my understanding and my experience is that would is strong\nThat when it's put together in this way as a carpenter probably use would glue and nails or screws to combine them together\nTo make that chair and that that chair is probably at a regulated construction in such a way that it will withstand me sitting on it\nBut the minute you sit on it the moment Gary you put the entire weight of who you are on that chair that faith\nSo with God it's no different you do everything you can to study to learn to to find out things but there's a point where you can't no you don't know if that cheers going to hold you up to you sit in that\nAnd there's nothing in life no one can handed to you know\nOne could point you do a scripture and go this is the one that's going to make all clear this is the one that you're gonna Christians act that way sometimes they're eager and they this is what's going to do it or all you gotta do is is it's not about that it is scriptures\nThis test all things hold fast to that which is true that's it but you will never know you will look both ways when you get to the side of the street before you cross it and the little sign will say green and you'll trust everything but you never know\nThere are people that have been hit by planes that fell out of the sky when they're crossing the street you've been taught to look both ways no one says look up\nTo the minute you step into the street it's with face you don't know all the options you'll never know all the variables you'll never know all the options but you're to study and to learn as much as you can and then there's a point\nWhere you have to have faith you have to walk into the street or you'll never go anywhere you have to sit in the in the chair or you'll never have rest\nAnd you just have to do it\nYou're not standing around everywhere 'cause well I don't know I mean it looks like would it looks like a chair I I'm trusting that it was made by manufacture to proper specifications are going to hold me up or well the sign says green but I don't know if they're not working properly and\nWhat if the light is really read the sciences green so I'm going to walk across the street or just stop sign was put here but I don't know if the person driving can't read or doesn't understand the science if you start\nDoing that you will never do anything you'll never move to point one that's not how you live in ...\nIn your everyday life but for some reason you giving yourself permission when it comes to God that you can throw every other thing out the window that you do on a daily basis and make it different\nFor God and I'm saying sit in the chair\nStep out into the street\n[noise] trust the signs look both ways get all your information as much as you can but in order to actually apply something there's a point of trust and appoint a face\nAnd if you look around there is nothing in this world Gary nothing that doesn't have to point out side do explain its existence\nYou have to point to your parents who pointed their parents went to their parents the acorn points to the tree that points to the acorn that chair that we talked about me that would have to point to the tree and the carpenter and all of these things and I'm saying if everything in the universe\nIs contingent has to point out side itself to explain its existence than the universe itself is contingent and has to point out signed itself to explain its existence there is a lot of reason for the existence of God there's a lot of reason\nThe south to explain its existence there is a lot of reason for the existence of God there's a lot of reason and intellectual understanding for the existence of a creator\nThere is nothing in science to ever says something comes from nothing science says the cause is always greater than the effect was the effective shut it something does it cost can't be nothing\nThere's plenty I could do this all day Gary but it means nothing if you're not willing to apply it to your life\nI understand do you yeah\nSo what do you do next\nContinue studying said take take that\nTake that first step I guess I'm\nI'm thinking a bill that\nIndeed you have to have a foundation your foundation has to be dirty just like anything else did your parents ever have faced\nI'm we never really talked much about that I mean they're good parents my\nDad passed away [noise] lobster yeah but I mean we can't really go to church or anything like that\nNo grandparents or anything where people um\nYou know then no one ever talked about God okay my friends talk more about it but it's not they're not a Christian they're they're they're more spiritual than and I guess\nAs spirituality spirituality doesn't get too much on its own\nBecause it doesn't it's\nLike a the concept of free love rather than a relationship it doesn't doesn't land anywhere there's no accountability and I think you need accountability\nAnd it it you need that structure so this is something you're going to have to build from scratch no one has pointed you in a direction and I'm saying that if you get into scripture\nAnd you find yourself a good Bible teaching Bible believing church\nThat is palatable to you the way they worship and all of those things um give them a little bit of your trust to learn and then if any red flags go up or you have any concerns you called me back okay\nSounds good and then we'll talk again\n[noise]\nThe Jesus Christ shall return in a moment to be a part of a show called in seven seven holy soon\nThe media cancer and AIDS affect all of us
