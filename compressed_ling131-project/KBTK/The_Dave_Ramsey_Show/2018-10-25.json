working the snowball October and\nWe're twelve thousand dollars away from chicken Sallie Mae out of the house will be done or some kind of like ... ... ... hopefully not earning hell\nWe're on our way I'm Glad that we are a coordinated our third and into peace class mhm and one of the things that keeps coming up that we're trying to figure out and also help advise others as you know were single income family and all that stays at home or help ensure your outrage yeah sure\nAnd and last month I had known as anybody else on a lake locked my way to go or and they're all ... up again and we're we're spending like twelve hundred dollars a month to carry the family on working track credit and you know co pay them by an everybody in the area is kind of ... that are cool comics just\nEverything's expensive here and so a bomb ...\nOh I Know you're in one one of the things I just I just want to\nI got one of them and throw away and\nI'm Wondering if you've been looking at you if you're a Christian health ministries and I think for a while you might have been your door from one for a while I Can't remember but we have anyways we're we've got some other families and our class or your finger income\nJust paying thousands dollars mark ... her pregnant for health insurance but then you know we can do a family on the health care mysteries for like for your mind nothing by ... I just I wanted to get your cake and\nYou know something personal in baby steps here when they were my wife and I talked about or a little more comfortable you know when we have a fully honored emergency right now I don't know we're trying to navigate that and I want to get your take\nOn the uh we do indoors a Christian healthcare ministries is one of our ah sponsors for the live events and for some other things over the years\nI'm full disclosure I have a group health care plan at our company here this Blue Cross Blue Shield that is my personal healthcare\nSo uh and I'm real careful on the show as you know or even through financial ... not recommend people to do something I don't do that kind of a thing but I'm In a little different situation I've got a decent program\nIt's a natural bees university not recommend people to do something I don't do that kind of a thing but I'm In a little different situation I've got a decent program a available to me um and so a Christian healthcare ministries um the the\nYou know the bottom line was the thing is it's technically not insurance as you know it it all sharing and it is based on the book of acts where Christians band together and share each other's burdens or in a sense becomes cooperative down is what it's doing 'em\nAnd uh the the you know I Would never suggest going into something like that that did not have a long or even the possibility of going into something like that that did not have a long track record and these guys have thirty forty years of having never missed a single claim\nNow you have to read and you should read very carefully to what it covers and what it does not cover\nAnd know that and they've got a couple of plans you can buy the upgrade plan that covers different things and that kind of a thing family plan their singles plan all that they've got a normal you know an array of products so to speak to learn what's covered and what is not covered learn how it works\nUm because it is technically not insurance you're technically if someone else in the program chose not to share\nThen war would you be you know technically but they've never failed to make a claim\nSo it's worked for forty years you know I mean or whatever number of years but decades right so I'm comfortable with its credibility in that regard it is different than insurance and we get our brains get dolled into how health insurance works and this has got some nuances some differences to it so learn what those are\nNumber one number to know that I don't personally do it even though I Do believe in at number three the only way I Do it as if they had a long long long track record which these guys\nDo and it is a Christian healthcare ministries and so a ... and the ... that their definition of that is is that if you use tobacco or ... or alcohol then you don't qualify\nAnd so they're already hard core in that regard um and so you need to you know be aware that that they are and that's a limiting factor as well and they you know they want you to affirm your face as part of the process through Christian faith\nAs a part of the process and so that's who it's for and how it's laid out but all of that and once you know all those nuances and you know those differences and you can see them um we would not have endorsed that if we didn't think it had credibility\nRight and that way and and I guess if I could ask one follow up question how we were to go through that New England babysat for you and all that kind of one of my life with a little concerned about\nOne of the ones we're looking into that as the long term track record and and we're OK with all the requirement for yeah where where evangelical Christians and all that out of there were ever normally pretty healthy food like a good\nFor our family by like one of 'em you know you pay out of pocket money to pay for ... and stuff so if you're a baby here would you recommend it when you go that route to set aside that they had a dollar to insulate you go\nYou've gotta you've already got or you've already got a thousand and baby step on so you're close enough\nOf that and if you run up over just budget your other five hundred into your budget slow or you might have to slow down your debt snowball a little bit in baby steps who covers some bills if you had an event right right right and it's just like carrying largest adoptable as you said in and they just say or something I'm but I'm going to take that part of the risk gone for sure\nAnd I'm so forth but but yeah Christian healthcare ministries is the one that we endorse\nHey man thanks for the call April's weather's April's in New York City Hi April how are you\nHave to say Hey David thanks for taking my call sure what's up\n[noise] so I went in you know whether or not and that has been and I should move 'em in order to get out of that [noise] um we don't like our house\nOkay um so we were out of debt you might be moving anyway\nRight okay absolutely um the balance on the market two hundred and ... ... um the value what's the value [noise] about four hundred and eighty thousand okay All right and\nOur you know our debt other than the market is about eighty thousand dollars\nMhm Mm hum by ... century K. K. to move and in order to get out of that\nWell I mean if you did and put a hundred and twenty thousand dollars down at the next place could you afford to make that happen yes\nOkay 'cause that would make your debt free and put then you've got you should have about a hundred and twenty leftover expenses and everything and eighty ... eighty of data paid off right right so um [noise] um yeah that that seems to make sense if you want to move anyway\nI Do want to move to Atlanta now you're going to move up and house equal house just different area or down and had\nTo have a little bit of them had ... killed the um the mortgage would be my mortgage it'd be higher\nUm by on a fifty likes drag on a Fifteen year figure right yeah and your payment of being more than a fourth of your take home pay yeah have you can do all of that and you\nGet out of a house you don't like into a house you do like there's no downside to this move okay but the you know the point is we're trying to get out of debt house and everything long term so we've got an aim at that\nAnd um you know go there as fast as you can so\nAppreciate your joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Jessica follows me on Facebook dot com slash day Ramsey how should someone using your plan to go about creating a residual income\n\nWell there's only one way to create residual income that's not some kind of Internet scam and when I hear some want to ask you a question about residual income I usually think scam\n'cause that's usually what is referring to okay so let's just kind of get that out on the table residual income is income that comes in steadily that you don't work for\nIts on earned income it's investment income as what real residual income is\nAnd or you create some kind of a business I have royalties on a book I wrote in Nineteen Ninety two that I got a check in yesterday that residual income it's continuing to come in right I'm Still making money on that but it wasn't a big check but it's still jak shut up okay so you know but it's residual income so that's ... rural teaser residual income\nInvestments create residual income investing and good mutual funds\nToning rental property rental property is residual income renters pay the rent assuming that they get to stay and all that kinda stuff every month right I'm ... and so that's residual income but don't fall into this you know people using some term that sound sexy and get yourself into some crap this is Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\nHeard me talk about ideas for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I ran across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity theft last year yes sixteen million\nNow right very cool so ah the ghettos and and they've struggled through this whole thing too with you obviously have they learn anything in the process\nI think so I Hope so [laughter]\nGood [laughter] okay well congratulations you guys were very proud of you and congratulations on beating the rain to him room and that's an incredible story thank you very cool and I hear your set with the pay for a house yeah what's that thing worse\nI it's probably three fifty to three eighty\nBearing not and it's yours so [laughter] it's yours about what nobody is going to get that one though is yours I Love it that that's a different feeling bugs that I've never been there it's a different feeling after you've been through stuff like you guys have been through or\nGerman I went through losing everything and nobody's coming into my house\nIt's mine is paid for very well done you guys very well done we got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired\nOne bestseller that should be the next chapter in your story millionaires that is what we're going for next and outrageously generous along the way so congratulations you guys thinking like you don't have the girls were practicing the debt free screen they have the younger to anyway I okay so the teenagers or took ... yeah yeah okay All right\nToby Christie Kelly Megan garment tailored for mapping am Illinois to hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars paid off in the six and a half years making a hundred the one Seventy counted down the road that free scream three two one well\n[noise] man absolutely fabulous congratulations you guys are question of the day comes from blinds dot com level one hundred percent satisfaction\nGuarantee that means even if you mess up\nIf you missed measure I could have done that if you picked the wrong color I could've done that they will remake your window blinds for free I Love this company blondes dot com gives you free samples free shipping and with a new promos run every month although always save you some money ...

they're able to make good money to pay off that are fair for future a husband and I experimented with some other options over the years like dried out insurance and\nDon't let up on me and some other thing but I'm I'm kind of point where I Know that I Need to make have a good career path but I don't really know where to turn\nOkay two quick questions first of all what is a financial target you have that you want to make was set amount of money per year\nI mean honestly if I can make like forty thousand that would be great\nGood okay next question you said multiple times you know what you're passionate about let's just lay it out there describe it water you passionate about doing\nWell he'll get an idea about children um they bring a lot of joy and the thing that I really don't want to teach honestly um\nWalk back and join the conversation you know they ran to show 'em to\nSitting in for their brands in the shower and joined by Rachel cruise we're taking your calls about money life career\nSo we talked about on the comes home and show and Rachel cruise show we're here for you triple eight eight\nTo five five two to five triple eight eight to five five to to find somebody who's the calls that you need some help you need some clarity today's the day Mexico\nNow before we went to the break I told you that I had some shocking information Rachel I cannot I'm beside myself for the excitement to let you react to the people don't notice you and I love a good spirited public conversation you know whether it be politics sports we enjoy a\nGood ... if we can have another radio show that wasn't recall revolves around money in Korea for a good way to have a current event will be good so so ... is a\nCurrent survey yes or no here's or at least set the scene as of June two thousand Eighteen according to the Federal Reserve\nIn America the consumer debt was three point eight seven trillion dollars oh that's a lot of debt or to the point that some Americans responded to a survey from my bank tracker and it's a small percentage\nBut when you look at the total amount of Americans is going to blow your mind\nAnd here are the basic freedoms here me when I say those folks basic freedoms that these people were willing to forgo if their debt would be wiped clean or reading hiking here we go [noise] two point four percent of Americans that's about six million Americans\nGet ... percent it's let's see like millions so that they again six million ... million Americans said\nThey would be willing to give up their freedom of speech if you took there [noise] [laughter]\nWe have a live studio audience\nIn the lobby of a financial ... she's real headquarters there shaking their head\nIlls that are really nice to be able yeah there's a guy out there with the Georgia had on I Know how you feel you know I get it okay freedom of speech meaning you can't say what you want in front of ... like the guys like beyond for your breath okay\nHere's the deal Joe lunch pail will take away your debt you're sixty thousand dollars in debt the differences you can never express that opinion the rest of your life\n... we we would be in ... what would happen to skin that got put on I Know what would happen to me I think I Would ... like I I Would go to jail for that anyways it immediately not be able to apparently they're not very opinionated\nPeople know but that's absurd ready for this this is this takes the cake three point five million Americans right to cruise would go to jail they would give up all freedom not just speech\nWould pull it all along they would pull on the orange jumpsuit and go to tell you they know it does it's not that detailed doesn't matter how ludicrous are we talking\nOr how long they would pull on the orange jumpsuit and go to jail you they know it does it's not a detailed doesn't matter how ludicrous are we talking style you know go to Ralph around jail they would go to gym all\nThe way from your family you know not have the freedom to choose not to further away from her family work and pay off debts you're just using that\nYou're just like he was all freedom you're ... jailed sued\nYeah now let's let's break this down for a minute we're having fun with this but but I I I Want you to jump in on this\nSo these are people there's there's three point five million Americans were going I don't want to sacrifice cable t._v. I don't want to sacrifice going out on an ... sports I don't want to sacrifice my rent a couch I don't want to sacrifice my F. two fifty that's costing me seven hundred bucks a month\nOr I don't want to sacrifice that\nTo get out of the three day rand's these baby steps and sewer plant I Want to go to jail\nI'll go to jail before that ... or ... or it's three point five million dollars who have not heard of the baby says they'll buy they just truly have locked all hope that they will never ever ever ever gotten out of it\nYou just hit the point they walk out so they think I'll go to jail and then when I get out of jail I don't have any doubt\nAbout that because they may I I Want to believe in my the glass as half full copy that there is wandering lasted ... that's not right yeah well I have to have full I got to ask George again without opinion what do you think about that in the lobby\nHe's like this he literally put his hands up and looked at the sky shit I what I Want to believe in my optimistic view yes that three point five million Americans says an optimistic but\nThat they just don't know that they can sacrifice lifestyle you can make different choices you can live on a budget you can take out an extra job for a short period of time and pay off that data is but the sad thing is that they had read like that they've just up\nThat they don't think you're ... you're exactly right I Hope that someone someone doesn't say I would rather not I'd rather not give up cable and go to jail is in jail didn't have cable in jail [noise] no I don't think I mean I Know\nI think is limited and it's like murder she wrote from Thirty years ago so here's the foreign Dave Ramsey has a plan so we're having fun with this crazy stuff that but the reality is if you're joining the show today and you feel that loss of hope you feel that\nDesperate take your basic freedoms you would give up your basic ...\nWe've got a plan is called Dave baby steps total money make over walk you through it joined the show the conversation on a daily basis take inspiration from the men and women that are showcased every day on the show do that every scream\nWell and on this show and the rights of Chris shall we always have a couple of come in and share their story and when I left in its edits ... you're listening to what you\nIt's it's everyday average American that's where it is people don't make crazy and kind of they don't have like a super being Cape like no these are everyday people choosing something different in this room and at that you have to choose something different for a different outcome and so that's that's the power that but again anyone out there you can do\nDrink doable AAA eight to five five two to five is the phone number that is how it started to take the step today triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Eric who's on the line and Kansas City Eric how can we help\n[laughter] how's it going good how are you sir\nGood um so I have two options I'm a registered nurse and I'm not going to grad school either nurse practitioner scores see aren't a school [noise]\nWe owe a hundred K. on her housework is free otherwise [noise] um we have a four month old and we're looking at having a second baby in the next year I'm In the school like a cash flow and worked full time through school would be\nA little bit longer it's about a five year program in totality a which is a prerequisite and and I could not work two to three years\nAnd the dead of that would be Ninety thousand dollars at the end of it\nAnd so I mean the payouts are different obviously in ... make a hundred K. give or take a journey is make sure the one Seventy five\nWhich do you really want if all those money things weren't an issue and you had the responsibility of a wife and the children in the house and all that which one would you want if you could snap your fingers\n[noise] [laughter] it's hard for me to personally answered is because there's the managers and disadvantages to um I don't think I Would take away a yarn anymore right okay but I mean I Would be happy as empty as well\nOkay so the question becomes a can you take that next step uh what do you call into in tea is that right\nYeah nurse practitioner okay ill okay in ... and so if you do that can you over time work your way into the other role\nNot without going back to that through your program and your same prerequisite\nFlight but my point is let's say you're in ... for five to seven years and you've got a no debt you may pay your house off in that time and so you cash flow your way through that as you move up the ladder\nHow old are you twenty nine yeah\nI just wonder can you do it just logistically can you do if you go into the into the situation you're going to move that so no additional debt can you overtime save enough money to cash for your way through that ultimate role\n\nI'm really know what are you making now ... okay so you'd have a forty grand bump\nBasically ... a year with that and how much does that skull coffee and he said that you the cash flow\nOr that one would be forty K total and the other one is nine thousand yeah correct oh you could\nDo it just started ... salary honestly\nAnd go and do that is forty can invest that but you're gonna make forty came back and a year the Atkins right if you do that I Know ... that and then go back to school yeah you may not be able to do than the other school right now like you said 'cause you know the cash for it they're not don't go into student loan debt for that\nBut go ahead and go through the school get an upgraded job upgrade basically and your little one in a sense that's an increase in income at least\nAnd yeah and then move into the school and a few years and ... you know\nThat ... I just want you to have that idea in your head I think well you pause you're sitting there trying to run the numbers and I think what I'm trying to do is make sure that you see that there's a ladder to that ultimate goal might it take you seven or eight years yes but guess what eight years from now you're thirty seven\nYou can cash flow your way so I think it's both fan that's what I said because both of them are what you want to do both of them or something that you're going to\nFocus more of your calls about your life your career your money you're on the Daily Show don't go anywhere [noise]\nAre you one of the millions of empty nesters are look around their house and just see unused space it might be time to downsize\nAnd go through that and and try to figure out people in your area that are doing that and then even get connected like even some churches some places that will have\nPeople in the family that need this specific help that that they can give you the referral a cause that would be huge as well so that that takes a little bit of time to kind of build up your book of business you're not only that financial coach but it's totally doable and to make that money for sure and so I definitely would go through our training on that route\nAnd I think you bring up a good point racial Chris at twenty eight I think you do need to look at the differences even if they're somewhat nuanced somewhat specific between the coach\nAnd the plant or because I think you can be a financial planner and make that money a lot faster and it's still a coach me Dave says all the time\nWe go sit down with Jeff do bonds and his team that's that's one of our local guys if I sit down with Jeff and I we want to know that he's got the heart of a teacher well that's what I hoped right so I Do think you've got to do some specific research there Chris to be able to determine what does it look like day to day what do I want to be doing day to day that fulfills me\nAnd at twenty eight you have plenty of time to get there are but in the meantime while you're pursuing the plan I Can't say this enough\nYou're not being dishonest you're not being a shy stir in the current job so let go of some of that guilt um and and and I think you're going to be fine I Would just would not let that way on you\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five is the number can Komen Rachel crew sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour let's go to Kimberly who's on the line and nodding home Pennsylvania Kimberley how can we do\n[noise] I can um I Am fifty five years old I had been teaching in public school and the health care for 'em Thirty years on and I just tell the last few years that on a typewriter or something else\nI'm On the back of last year really then I'm drawn to real estate I looked into it\nUm yeah I can collect my retirement um if I retire with a little bit of a penalty\nOn as opposed to going all thirty five years of my only on\nA challenge or block is convincing my husband that's a good idea\nBecause it would be a bit of a difference and here I was about twenty five thousand dollars in salary but I Know that I can make that um I I really get excited thinking on helping people find Hong thing operate he and\nI find that really interesting okay what I Love my teacher in but it's just time for it\nI get it I got good news I got good news for you and your husband okay [laughter] so for you to become a realtor a successful realtor it's going to take you a little bit of time\nAnd I think the fact that you just reveal to us and our audience that you're still enjoy teaching there's no big hurry you're not calling in a completely burned out and so I Would not take the penalty either I how many more years just for fun real quick how many more years would you have to stay in the role\nOf teacher before he retired without penalty\nFor five years\nOkay I just want to throw scenario what is over the next five years you've built your real estate business showing homes at night and on the weekends\nI think that's extremely doable anybody who's ever been successful in real real estate knows you've got to build a pipeline your husband's only real concern sounds like to me rituals that he doesn't want you to lose that twenty five thousand dollars that's a that's a scary thing certainly your age\nWhat if you kept the teacher salary for maybe three years still take a little bit of Hillary but I'd like to see you go all the way build that real estate business\nOver five year period is going to be here before you know it you step into retirement full benefits and by that time you should have easily replaced if not maybe another extra you know twenty five thirty percent above and beyond what you make you I think you can just absolutely double your income\nWhile still being a teacher I think that's the thing that I'd want you to consider Rachel\nBob and it's a it's a great situation to be an because real estate usually agent show how this when people aren't working so that means it is night than it is weekend that's what the busiest time and so to say hey I'm going to commit for maybe when you know housing and decide that a year two years three years old can even go to five years if you can't\nWhatever it is and say okay we're in commitments amount of time and if you start to see yourself like well I'm really good at it because you sound very enthusiastic about it you know sound like a people person which means you're gonna be a great residents say they drink and most people do great when they have great people skills as it sounds like you can really so\nEven though you're enthusiastic he's still may not be great at it you can kind of get some things on your belt while you're learning for again a year or two\nMaybe three years whatever your husband decide\nAh and then kind of step into it yeah I wouldn't go cold turkey by any means but I think that this could be excellent because having a great wrote that agent here and do anything about it is it so commission base that you get to decide what you make basically like how much you work how many have you sell super fun versus going from where we're at the salary as a teacher\nTo do something like that can be very incredible for you personally and you may find that you're really good at it and maybe in a year's side about\nUs and I think once you show the hubby replaces the twenty five right I Want to give you one piece of advice you go and followed by him but he's been on the show he trained the populous states of America Ryan
