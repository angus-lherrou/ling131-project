I think it's going to make your mind on a yeah\nI live in a job and all that stuff I used to take the bus excuse me ... and just to be very tiring for once I paid off my lawn I went ahead and go to a lady extend the gutter and it was kind of are you under the impression that you know I look at her wedding my work so hard that kind of a thing\nA good thing coming up to eighty and the ... about a dozen others\nAnd one thing about the guy that I thought from the show and ever since I've been doing better than they can really really bad about it because you know\nYou can give you that you should never get into that and that's exactly what it\nHow come you're not going to help you today sir\nYeah so my question and I have a couple of questions one thing I said ...\nWhat's your household income Seventy five still do it and you make thirty are you oh thirty I'm sure you oh thirty and we're we're we're you how quick you're going to pay it off\nI mean if I live with my mom like Cleveland and maybe I maybe\nThank you for joining us human genes in is with us in Los Angeles find the gene how are you\nAre you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm south just give you a just come back right after they shut me [laughter] so um I graduated high school a few years ago and I had to go to community college in community college I'm at work I went to\nA work [laughter]\nUm I did about like thirty hours a week for the community college and it wasn't an issue and now I transferred to a university I mean my first semester right now mhm um classes are you um you know a little bit harder\nSo my question was do you think I should quit my job and focus more on school for the last two years or do you think I should just\nI'm just trying harder and a dj Cooper\nMhm what are you studying accounting okay\nI've got a finance degree and I work forty to sixty hours a week while I went through school and for years at at the university level so I'm a it's doable um you are you know you are doing a lot of studying and not a lot of partying for sure how the um how are you paying for school\nUm I go to I get grants and also I'm just a minute work\nOkay so you're you're not going into debt now ... okay so if you quit work how would you pay for school I had a money saved up from a working for the past year I don't mind my thing I think it will probably like call of mhm\nWe left me a year you know I think I keep working okay\nIf it ... if it costs you half a point on your grade point average um yeah I heard about\nIt like cheap yeah yeah I graduated with up to nine seven\n\nI missed it as a magnet by I'm just making about three one hundreds of them still piss Thirty years later but [laughter]\nBut but you know what I have never had a single color ask my GPA before this my advice [laughter]\nAnd I actually I've never gone on a job interview where they asked my GPA in my entire life ever in if you're wanting to go to work for one of the top accounting firms in the entire world they might ask your GPA and you might actually be in competition or GPA might actually matter\nOn your very first job but after that it won't um and it has a whole lot more to do with did you learn how to do accounting than what your GPA is and will you work hard while you're at work and that kind of stuff\nAnd so what are you doing for work right now\nUh I work at a bank mhm okay good\nOkay alright poke around in the accounting field and see if you can get on with one of them making about the same kind of money one of them I'd actually aid for your degree\nYeah something into\nA wouldn't hurt anything to ask around and see if we can make a job James and make about the same money and get free tuition or something that'd be very cool\nOn top of it but I'm I'm\nYou know you're not working a hundred hours a week you were going thirty hours a week twenty hours a week you can do this it's very doable uh most people work when they're in school it's not that unusual\nReally by the way uh when I when I Do a vent I\nWas just in San Francisco this week and we're doing the vent we sit right Chris Hogan asked the audience were three thousand people there how many of your work when you were in college I mean it's like Ninety percent of the audience raised their hand now maybe the people that didn't work when they're in college and listen to my show I don't know but\nIt appears that most people were when they're in college that is what it looks like and so um I I think if I'm here I'm going to continue that route good question thank you for joining us a ... is with us in Houston Hi Lucia how are you\nI Am doing well thank you for calling and I hope I get back on here and my husband and I I mean babies that you're getting at it that we are and what you call it the dream team and make them for a down payment on or how much they asked them that we're looking right now at about a\nGreat thing about them I frequent down um our how our account before I'm sounding like when you're about one class size and after about it I called up one thirty two so I'm trying to make sure that I like them all about like how much how by on that\nThe um\n[noise] I I I think he recommended and afford to have your take home pay exactly a okay perfect and so I wanted to make\nSure that like right now where paint with a million markets calculators and right now we're kind of a funny one hundred and one of 'em and come up like a reasonable comfortable amount\nAnd I don't have enough and I know I think number than it is but you know it's a lot better\nNow but if that's what that's what a fourth of your take home pay or less and your debt free with your emergency front and blows you have the mouth spread to prosper if you continue to budget and stay on track but again that's not what you should do touch them most\nYou should do so you can do less if you want to 'em or you could put on a shorter term if you want to ... and you know I'm about\nLess house at Twenty one hundred and paid off in ten years there's nothing wrong with it on five years I don't care I mean you can do a lot of stuff but the most I Would ever tell you to do and I I don't even do that 'cause I don't borrow money at all\nFor anything ever is a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payment is no more than a fourth of your take home pay Luke\nIs one of those in Dallas Hi Luke welcome to the day Ramsey show\nID very better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nSo um my wife and I have a written to you for many years actually my dad got me was when I was a young kid and I'm Glad to not take her by her and I have student loans and um [noise] we are considering taking a cash out refinance house\nTo knock out the high interest you know um and then start paying the debt off on the house because it that much lower interest rate [noise]\nAnd how much they want to hear my student loan to the um red at forty eight thousand drank and what's your household into\nIt but actually clean takeover forty to sixty so I own my own business so last year we did sixty five this year we're looking at probably doing I'm probably going to bring a culture to forty two\nOkay I I don't know what you've been listening to on the show but in a twenty six years I've never told someone to do a refinance actually take care of the pay off their debt over except to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure and you're facing neither\n... and so on no I've never told anybody to do that\nOkay and the reason is very simple you make enough money to pay this debt off in a couple of years um you've got to work like a maniac and you're gonna have to have no life\nBut then you're going to be dead free except your house and then you can work on paying off your house I'm from there and of course start working on your retirement and the other baby steps that we won't be groups but you can't borrow your way out of debt\nAnd on and if you pay them off within two years the interest rate on this becomes ... medically irrelevant\nBecause they're not so fast\nIt's like you're keeping it for Thirty years it's a two year thing and and really is not forty eight thousand for two years or twenty thousand for two years because halfway through you're going to be halfway through\nAnd and so yeah you guys need to get on a budget really really tight budget very careful where Donald in\nTouch your lifestyle to nothing do everything you can all your business to increase your income because you need to clean up the student loan debt I agree with you on that part but no I don't I don't tell people to borrow to get out of debt you can't borrow your way out to dinner and work your way out of a whole\nDigging out of a whole is a an oxymoron excitement that we all make which I'm digging a hole you're not digging out of hope you dig out the bottom of a hole gets deeper and she can't dig\nOut of hope you have to fill in the whole you know to climb out of the whole maybe but you don't dig out of a home\nUnless you dig into China to work so no you can't you can't you can't borrow your way out of that and that's the same exact situation so you got to stop that you have to break that cycle\nLittle on the sand and say well now borrowing money ever\nEver ever ever visited Iran's you show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare\nI don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it there or will they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with timeshare exit team\nCome out with Romney where you were how what light bulb moment that you have a ha moment where you want oh\nYou know David it's amazing when you go to this clash and it's a big support group that I think everybody really needs to be a part of\nWe we lived in a very high end area and it was just amazing how much debt everybody had\nAnd were like wow like for you know there's a support group and you know this is a great way let's start with the baby steps mhm and we did that we had a bunch of savings saved up and we used a lot of that just Kickstarter bizarro intensity and it really helps how much\nAre we at about ten thousand okay and so\nThat was hard for a nerd was it was a checkout clean as I said it was an\nOfficer takes your breath away so Veronica spend or goes to clash you go to class but then you get in there and there had to be a moment where you go much sure I like fish\nWell it wasn't so much\nThat I didn't like it I just I felt like I needed like I said strategies to help me 'cause I I didn't want to be in that either and I just felt like there is just a huge cloud over as all the time and what was your\nBiggest takeaway ban where you went aha I see that now\nEverything about it was awesome honestly and I think it was realizing our roles and and with him being dinner that he is and then me and just coming to my senses and saying you know is this is this material things something that I really need to have them\nUsing the ... system really helped me ... and knock out\nOur budget and this is the amount of money we need to pay for our groceries and says you know this is how much we we can get in the church and it's just how much we can give people for gifts and what not and so I just needed to lay out and once we implemented those steps\nYou know we're just\nLets you sound a little bit like Rachel ritual Greece is that a budget is permission to spend I Love your daughter permission to spend okay yeah\nYeah and that's exactly what it is I there is sometimes when I just felt like we didn't have any money that the mindset I had to get myself in okay we don't have money for this but you know it's there and we want it ... you know and I'm In a budget\nBut once I started I let it control me I don't know very very good okay so we know uncle was a cheerleader when your brother was a cheerleader and you had the community that you're plugged into which are leaders who else Roger biggest cheerleader\nI think and I mean we're really close to our family and my family through all of them are very supportive of us we we both come from five brothers are\nNot cyber [laughter]\nFive kids from each family so two brothers and sisters so we have it come from a big family but and they were all supportive of us really and our friends and as well so\nAre cool so what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is now that you've done it\nI think the key thing David is being on the same page ... you know communication is key and you know we went to the money and marriage last week and we were listen to a lot of the other couples mhm and none of them have gone through the financial peace but they've gone through a lot of seminars mhm\nAnd I think if they had gone through a seminar or the financial peace university they would really get on the same page and it was just really exploded once I get through that and and follow the steps yeah\nAnd just you know riding down our goals with really important for us to do and once we had that you know are very cool driven\nAnd especially being in sales jumped you got to be ... you know we have that target and we wanted to hit it and said just staying focused and dedicated and discipline and really really helped us\nWell done you guys from very proud of you very well done your shrunk couple a lesson right choice that marriage money thing or it's but virtually stand up comedy because they're both a book about a ... yeah they really are funny and they're both funny on the green room to by the way that I mean\nIt's the same thing so while well
