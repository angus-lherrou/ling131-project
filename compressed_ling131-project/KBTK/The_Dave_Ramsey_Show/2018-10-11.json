not going to exactly like man I Would be off the country I'm I'm a big ended up hiring again\nI'm not on anything like that I'm On there I Love 'em um but minimum like I think for a hobby I'm getting max and now I'm ... I'm\nI'm so that I mean on one that I'm putting in on it other than that I have um savings in my account and income upset at the gate with a couple of interest I think more about I'm ... I'm Talking to you\nOr maybe not the way to get a um I mean I became quote I'm ... I'm Out in a long term commitment to it for a long\nTime uh I mean the the problem with short term investments says it's very very hard\nUm you know short term investments bicycle a savings account and it's going to pay you know one or two percent right now I'm you know and when you do long term investments and then you pull them out short term as you said you can get the market could move down on you and you could actually lose some of the money\nSo um if you want to position some of it in long term investments with the idea\nThat ah the hope that we are going to make some more but the idea that we could actually lose someone will take some risk where some of that that's an okay thing to do um\nBut you know basically if you know you're going to need the money and the actual principals very important to you I you know there's not a ... intermediate investment that I'm comfortable with that I use a so I'm pretty much either putting it in a savings account or I'm investing it\nAnd sometimes I'm investing it knowing that I may or may only be in their year and it could be down in a year and but I'm going to take that risk just because that's money I can say that I have a little bit of um margin with meaning I can afford to lose a little bit of money\nAnd if that's the case then then it's okay but that that's what we're faced with this actually is in Minneapolis Hi Zack how are you\nAre you doing better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nHi I'm I'm currently in college and I paid cash transfers master and I'm planning on joining the national guard\nBut I'm Wondering if I should continue going to college after I joined the national guard or if I should go back to my home town and just live with my parents that I'm basically getting paid to go to college\nOkay when you go back to your hometown live with your parents would go to a different college\nYeah I'd go to a university that's within twenty minutes of my parents' house\nAllergen okay if you don't go back home

ship builder cashed it\nOkay and how much do you like finishing school excuse me what year are you in school [noise] um I'm a freshman oh so you've got three and a half years to go or whatever\nWell yeah and then I Am actually think laugh sophomore credit so I graduate in two years\nOkay she got two years to go what are you studying finance okay\nAnd why would you stay where you are\nJust because it has a better business school recognition I guess for the state\nMhm or the other places water community college or university this local or\nYeah just the local university and not as um right now I'm at the University of Minnesota which is a lot bigger I guess too\nRight okay All right well um if you actually get of the knowledge of the reputation of the school really doesn't matter much in Ninety nine percent of the jobs up there okay\nIf you actually get the knowledge now if the actual quality of the education is lower [noise] then that's a different discussion okay but I Would not stay someplace merely for its reputation [noise] but there's other\nReasons that you want to stay in that location you like it there you want to stay in that area are you you know you've enjoyed the uh the experience of being there and you're willing to work to pay for it if\nYou can pay cash for it I'm OK either way\nThere's not a financial problem either direction\nOr it's just a matter of of where you want your degree to be from where you want to live the next two years of study\nAt your age I likely would have stayed where you are because I'm going to work just to be out on my own\nBy

now\nNumber three is shelter now you pay your rent\nIt doesn't matter if you pay your rent and you can't sleep there because there's no heat so you've got to put heat in the blaze okay so you pay your

can sell and what we can do to create an income I mean you may have to amputate the ...\nOr you may have a big stinking car payment this killing you you may have to take like six extra jobs and draw

excellence\nOvertime\nContinued excellence not one moment of excellence but continued excellence and ordinary things when you do ordinary things with a level of excellence that's called diligence and by the way that makes one rich\nInteresting isn't it the hand of the diligent what's the hand hand of the diligent makes one rich\nSo here's one of the things I figured out I read this study years ago and now the observed it in all the millionaires we meet with and talk with and and it showed up again in this millionaire study that Chris Hogan and the team just did for the everyday millionaire project you know we interviewed ten thousand millionaires among the things we found there and one of the things we found in this study before that that I read years ago was\nThank you for joining us Americans donors in San Francisco part don't welcome that I bring him to show him how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so I'm forty five and I'm looking to retire at fifty five I'm I have a\nPension and I'll be getting like Seventy five percent of my pay\nCheck in or one K. and stuff like that but um [noise] I've been recently started listening to you and I've already paid off someone like that but\nUm what's left is only about thirty four hundred but I'm sure I'll be on the path of Ninety Days after that my question is I've been looking into refinancing in my house because I have an F ha and so I have PM I and I\nWhen I Do the math like the six thousand dollars and closing the U.S versus a hundred and eighty seven\nMonth ended up being the three years plus my interest rate is going to go up so I'm not sure if that's the smart thing to do\n... okay you're going to stay in the home longer than three years that's the only way you're gonna end up getting gravy on that biscuit right yeah for sure so um that's how you analyze it um that's\nThat's kinda borderline that's the tipping point is much longer than three years I probably on your break even analysis I probably would not but if you're you know Ninety percent sure you're going to be there longer than three years you're going to pass the break even point start making money even at a higher interest rate is what you're telling me right\nI'm well I'll get out of having to pay the hundred and eighty seven\nYeah but what your interest rates go up and offset that\nHe well he acts like three point seven five now and everything I'm getting hurt and it's about like for you know so you're not going to make any money so is it better than I hate to sound\nLike you're gonna be a force on you're probably gonna be four seven five on a Fifteen year right now uh today and so that's like one percent spread 'em and so what is your a loan them out\n[noise] this one is a hundred and sixty six thousand\nOkay and so one or two or three years I've already paid off ten thousand on but one\nPercent on a hundred and sixty six thousand increase is sixteen hundred dollars a year\nOkay and you're only saving Eighteen hundred or a hundred and eighty dollars a month which is about two thousand dollars a year so no I wouldn't do this if that's the only if that's the numbers yeah I'm On the air bicycle breaking even to refinance and I wouldn't do that I pay the loan off\n[noise] and then I add one other question I just joined ... and in my area everybody is already in session but some of them have\nOnly done one class jumping I still going\n... and in my area everybody's already in session that some of them have only done one class\nJumping I still don't even go in\nYeah jumping you'll be okay All right yeah the first classes on savings and you're already head of the game on that you're eating machine and you can go back and watch it on with your own line is you've got a one year membership and you can watch or listen to everything on line for a year\nOkay so yeah you go and watch them less than one and then when you go in Iraq with whoever zone listen to your right in sync okay\nYou have no trouble or at all you're doing great way to go dawn you killed a ghetto Christina ... with us in Boise idaho I Christina how're you\nDoing well thank you Dave I'm so we have a and a great situation for our family but I'm not quite sure how to proceed we I'm told her home in California and walked away with a lot of equity and had to take me to see how much weight\nI'm okay with that how much equity about two hundred and forty thousand boom boom love it yeah and um so we're here it gets ranking while we kind of figure out you know if we want to build or buying 'em but I'm not\nQuite sure 'cause we have our our savings we have our retirement we have all that\nOut of debt that we get to go yeah we don't have any debt good\nBut it ... it's going to pay cash for a house yeah what\nWe want or at home we have what we wanted we want where\nWe were you know we want something that costs more than what we have all kinds of what part of small mortgage on it paid off real fast okay\nYou know what I mean again I mean well I mean what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and fifty\nOkay and what what would you be talking about building or buying or price range\nOh preference between four and six\nOkay and you have to forty in the bank mhm\nOkay so if we should for forty as an example you talked to hundreds I was not a morning right\nAll right how 'bout you compare that all five years trail babbling yet you know I mean just knock it out how old are you I'm I'm forty five and my husband if\nYou have any money in savings were investments to this not in a retirement account\n... okay All right\nWell my role is almost never take out a mortgage that is on more than a Fifteen year mortgage and the payments more than a fourth of your take home pay you're not even going to approach\nThat right away and then you'll be close to that and so if you take out a two hundred two hundred fifty dollars or\nMore to do you want a really fine house in Boise idaho for half a million dollars that's a long ... that's wonderful property and read about what\nWe're hoping more real property and now they have\nIt's a whole different world though obviously from where you came from rights and so I'm mean your bang for buck is huge and boy she compared to you know a big City California so um yeah you you're going to make a huge progress here and\nYou know you just about whatever if you take a small mortgage or out in a small relative to your situation in other words I'm not going to yell at you know I don't borrow money so ... we'd be buying a two hundred fifty thousand dollar house and then we'd be saving money and we'd move up later\nThat's how we would do because I mean we don't borrow money for any reason ever but if it's the only thing I don't yell at you for borrowing on on this show and in your case though just how the different mindset\nThat the mortgage is just more like a car loan\nAnd we're just going to knock it out real fast I mean like other people's rate a car loan like five years or something you know let's just put on there and\nHow fast can we knock this thing in the head and let us get after it and that's how I Want to think about it it's a really good question thanks for joining U.S Open phones or triple eight eight to five five two to five Sarah is in California Hi Sarah welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] and I was wondering if I should tell my car work eight to ... ... pay off my about forty thousand dollars a day and start my emergency fund like card paid off what is your household income about thirty thousand a year\nYou should not have an Eighteen does ... you have too much tied up happening is going down in value when you're out on your car or things with motors wheels of any kind added up equals more than half your annual income how did you end up with an Eighteen dollar paid for car making thirty grand\nAnd I was married and we refinanced our house and included the car in the mortgage\nAnd then he got and and then we\nGot a divorce and we sold the house in the car we paid off\nGot it okay and I got a car and so what is your um what is your income prospects\nMeaning you're thirty now where will you be in a year where were you being three years\nRan around thirty thirty tail so you don't ... you'll see this doubling then no okay why uh I haven't got to school yet okay and I'm a single mother and fighter and so yeah you you need the money more than you need that\nCar don't you yeah yeah I in the cars going down in value quick so yes Charlotte pay off your debt put your emergency phone in place you can get you an inexpensive car that you pay cash for probably in the five thousand dollar range\nOkay maybe seven something like that there's something reliable and you can get lots of car for five to seven thousand dollars right now\nIn your debt free and you got a good emergency fund and then put you in a much better position but as a rule of thumb cars are the largest thing that we all by that goes down in value anything on wheels or motors for that matter if it's got wheeler motor\nIt it's going down about you and when you have all of that stuff I had it together you don't want too much of your life financially too much of the math on the wrong way\nAnd you get when you have more than half your annual income tied up and things going down in value then that makes it real tough to prosper in your case you're going to change your income by going to school until you're going to change later but for right now I'm with you yeah I Would show that cost dishes today Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\nTime to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend the quick Churchill checkup then just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage\nThat says Tom by your money and I could use this money to make more than I'm making now so ah but what I have found is is when I Do pay off my house I I don't know which risk neutralizes a lot of those the difference between the foreign the ten percent\nIt takes away most of that spread when you when you you know when you factor interest 'cause we're there is risk when your mortgage now it's not a lot of risk because you've got the money in the bank today to pay it off but er an investment by it off but there is rich and so on you have to admit that you know one hundred percent of foreclosures occur on home with a mortgage there is rich\nAnd so I'm getting rid of that\nWell how I found this it's not completely quantifiable I'm In a simple mathematical formula\nBecause when you don't have a mortgage your start making different decisions with your career\nYou start making different purchase decisions you start having different levels of enjoyment with your money your relationship with your spouse talks to have a different depths because there's a a level of security in your overall life that there wasn't before and those things are really hard to put on paper so what I figure it out is I'm going to live a hundred percent that free\nAnd I'm going to invest like crazy the rest of the money that I have in cash that comes in and I've ended up with a ton of money doing that because I don't have any risk and I'm just investing real money not borrowed money shut all of that to say if I woke up in your shoes I pay off your mortgage today\nAnd if you ... if this discussion bit sour on you and you think they ran she's crazy a year from now just get you into the mortgage\nNo I I I completely agree I mean I took the one\nThing that he got space just if it's a lot of money I'd go you know I just go I mean I like that and get paid off but my mind sort of just wrestle back and forth for\n... ... what I'm trying to point out is is that your the your gut is not intellectually wrong your mind is your minds using an incomplete primitive formula got it\nThat's what I'm pointing out that makes sense completely yeah after you got this thanks for the call open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five shoot your heart's where he's not really you got your heart your heart's where you measure risk march telling me pay off my house\nMy ... tell me I could make more money ... money but your heads missions from stop its mission risk\nAnd um it's kind of a fun thing that I was doing this with a clash of MBAs speaking to them and a cause MBAs or all talk you know masters in business they're all taught strategic thought and they're all taught to borrow money\nAnd uh I got up and ask degree I'll stop to borrow money my broke finance professor used to teachers to borrow money and so um you know ... it's broke finance professor at like a shop teacher would missing fingers right people so think about this rise by ... ... you just can't think that way and you have a different way of looking at things show\n'em but there's you can really do a very sophisticated mathematical application of this it would just take a lot of time too much time really in the radio to walk through the whole thing but what happens is is think about this how many of you if you had zero debt\nAnd you looked over in your four one K. and there's three hundred thousand dollars and you had forty thousand bucks in the bank for emergency fund would make different career decisions\nWay too many readers said yes meaning I Would leave this jerk but I work for it and I would go do dot dot dot\nUnless I go in business for yourself necessarily you might just have a different career you might go on a completely different direction that thing you've always wanted to do why are you waiting\nYou know and here's the weird thing is that thing you've always wanted to do is probably where you make the most money you've ever made in your life if you're wise about how you do it this idea that if you don't love your passion you make half the money no you make twice the money\nYou make more money when you're doing something you're good at 'cause you work harder at your creative you think about all the time you can't keep yourself from moving because you love it you don't think I Love what I Do I Can't keep myself from sitting at my laptop writing a blog article\nI Can't keep myself from doing it I Can't keep myself from coming down here and doing this radio show when I'm In town\nI was ...\nAnd I'm really good at it as a consequence incomes once I get paid a lot\nOf money on a shame middling\nI'm a capitalist pig baby I love this [noise] I'm here baby\nThat's how I Want that for you see that's what set you up to me how many of you if you didn't have any payments would tell your boss she was a jerk\nTo stick it take this job and shut it I mean we would do that yeah there you go that's a man and I'm not trying\nTo quit your job today I'm saying there are benefits to being debt free that are beyond the simple mathematics of the fact you don't have to be interesting when you start to be set free slavery is more than a simple\nPossession [noise]\nChanges the ...
