I'm not exactly sure what to think that there is not the kind of scary too that it or how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took this out when your husband was a trial yeah\nThis is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd at ... ... dollars\nWhile it should be canceled okay\nBecause our whole life insurance policy about ... million dollars is a very expensive\nRight yeah and like my grandparents and I found out the beneficiary like out I mean it's a great guy I'm not worried about you know that it's\nI don't I don't care as a guy doesn't matter if we had a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there is a very like going on you know wild one\nBut it's strange how long have you been married how long you been married five years yeah and then five years they've not address this issue that's strange yeah that's right yeah really\nI mean they should you should address the issue it they should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled\nBecause I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums on a half a million dollar policy that's a whole lot policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a port right of return that when you die they keep your money\nSo her whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just only about half a million dollars of whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you've got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance symbolizes proper on you and on your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and say that\nUh I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's like I don't want anything to paying for something that you know not only that but you have on how\nWell it's not only not needed because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan a plan has now changed\nYep 'cause you need to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you David how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm a question regarding up part of my retirement savings say come as a thing called a pension from my company and\nYeah regarding up part of my retirement savings sat coms I called a pension from my company and that\nOverall like a bad guy eight percent of my total has had a\n... year of your favorites or pension\nOh well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement pay two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be by ... percent of my total have had you know and and my question is whether the gap has a\nLump sum yes or ... okay\nYes here's why okay if you die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all gonna die okay when you die a\nThat money's gone 'cause it's a pinch and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefit the money's gone it's gone\nAnd I think if you live I or as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we've got an account for you over here two hundred and eighty five thousand you can invest it you can make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you could think that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent\nAnd when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal right\nYeah I guess [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but uh so\nIt's still love you die then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you know the same concept of ... so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die\nMakes this a bad deal\nAnd so you always take pension lumps on are almost always take Benjamin lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest them and good roast duck mutual fund so it sounds like your net worth sending system a million\nA yeah it's a closer to\nClose that and that's probably about four oh well yeah total\nTotal network to assets house was hopeless\nNo Well Don ... congratulations how old are you I'm sixty three way to go how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my ah my family and my wife came on forty\nA millionaire or that was before that happened\nA\nA millionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents type where our typically young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\n\nA holding pattern or because of the amount you know the heritage is is maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nIt's home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now it's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell about twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise] well I certainly you got to a live well below your means when they are a modest lifestyle which uh we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I knew people do stupid things I've done a stupid thing which I think if you can limit\nStupid thing that that should do along the way that's good I like that [laughter] big\nBecause because every every everybody listening right now is has done\nOr will do stupid things but then you can minimize those ... along the way and we have a modest lifestyle will blow your means I'm no void\nSo do you think there'll be done to them that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nIs probably a probably even higher if they stay minimize the stupid you know it maybe I get minimize that as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir menu done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and it's that simple math on that works to your benefit a at a wall of live if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor short you come out three hundred grand ahead\nA thank you for

mean I don't want to go into detail in the past ... years are I'm sure I'm I'm I'm okay um so\nSo what's your what I Want to do is ... I'm sure because it's relatively new guy that I yeah\nWell what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced got to help you that you have with is the better your estimates are currently because once you've dipped battled with her for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in a budget items so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand dollars a doctoral every year\nThen that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know a\nA whatever a line in your budget for medical expands ongoing chronic medical when just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name\nEver a line in your budget for medical expands all knowing chronic medical when just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and money set aside for that so that every 'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up\nAnd leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean ... issue is that I'm literally on like penny pinching\nI told him I see where I can make that happen so what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month and then click out fifty dollars that you really like right now on what I I'm I'm hoping overtime on the opposite you know pay out more\nSo why are we got an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem where\nI got that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand I that\nI make I don't think a lot on the life and social worker and because of my condition actually switched jobs had more functionality\nOn Sundays fee for service division as opposed to a salary position right now and I make anywhere from Thirteen hundred ... a paycheck on\nAnd you get ... you back twice a month okay and you said you're living with them\nI guess I'm I'm living with a roommate I pay nine Seventy five for rent or buy a lot um and I did that somehow from ...\n... and what is the nature of the debt student loan\nPratt is actually a credit card I also because they can hear it I was trying lot of holistic thing mhm I'm not at all and then he didn't know they know that that if I get it out there that have like a total of fixed because\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things and the food\nPantry not eating\nNot eating out and you're paying like in\nYour life your lights and water and your rent and your transportation\nSo food shoulders loading and transportation and utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the sense that the necessities only the debt you've got is not necessities you take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you work at the end of the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going repair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming\nYou're told me that that's why you called yeah yeah yeah I mean it's not me declaring it I'm saying great actually I've got my own medical\nHow to prepare for it you're saving coverage so\nNow that's our short term long term okay we got to get your income up and you're out go down to knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that you\nCan you know be prepared to take on the long term which is get your income up but uh we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards it's time for plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you\nDoing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell me and my wife I'm going through a baby step here right now I'm at that we just paid off our second credit card the day that we are done like credit card and move on if they don't mind\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're working the base that too and we're looking our budget and yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about tithing\nAnd all the way we want to ... percent and um I realized that we were not an imposition begin right now we're trying to pay all that we can give later\nOn on what I'm saying what economists model that I'm kind of a ... law and get your input on it we have our campers can fight it but we want to live without thinking about what you got up\nAnd giving back to the church and then having that extra five percent and kind of giving it to um other\nCharitable organizations that we believe in that are doing day or a ... you know when the crisis mission and so we're trying to get what we can try to give what we can to people who need it\nUm but then she don't have an aunt strike ... percent a church and then you are or what we do what we can't give you know we're not in the media and she wants to give it to church and\nWe had a big argument about five and yesterday I was\nI was on the the definition of dies the definition of the time is when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term and Jesus reaffirmed given the New Testament\nIs tense it literally means chant the word means tamp\nIt doesn't mean sphere that doesn't mean twenty is it means to him\nNow you can decide whether you want to tie they're not you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we have an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says and so what ... opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker ... Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you\nI Love you and um you can give are not given all still love\nYou but the best way to live your life is to to gifts\nAnd all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed lives in the New Testament is a ties attempts of you're in some evangelicals have taught and believe for Fifteen hundred years at that time this is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top before you do anything else and he goes to your local church\nSo if you want to biblical answer\nYour wife wins the argument that the biblical not your wife argument but she was correct biblical [laughter]\nActually both are probably true [laughter]\nGood luck with that brother\nOrder to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\nSo one Osama includes cars\nYes it into the cars\nFifty on cars and what's the other fifty five on\nA thirty three thousand on student loans a little bit of the majority of my wife's ah about eight thousand on line and a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like that\nGot it and what's your household income [noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five and a half years and um we're making about one one oh five one twenty ... a year what did you use to the old job\nYeah that that's what I was making before a yes before okay um what do you make now why now I'm\nIn real estate I'm actually I got my license in March and June ... June was my first day in real estate mhm I've got to choose a health is so thick listings and extending clothing bought into uh the second week of November So\nWhat is your projected income for the uh the that six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand by the end of the year and that was\nWhat does your why didn't make of the ...\nFifty a she made a fifty one thousand\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much as you used to make\nYes okay good good news right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first started out I'm only selling to houses that between that long span\n'em and hurt thing is she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money to pay her car [laughter]\nBecause that's not how it works when we're married that's\nHow it works when your roommates you get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for poor and sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows sad\nAnd so it you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to create if you want to be married\nWe are doing this together in other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just you can handle that cancer thing there by yourself and those trips that came out you get to do that by yourself you're not going to do that to her right no no you would take care of her because we are now one\nWhen we're married and and it's in sickness and health and right now the house is sick and so we don't get to be a print system be selfish and that's not an option sorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her is that we needed my my truck it's for sale already I have it on the market good home as soon as I as soon as I Do some of these qualities of course we'll have\nIf I Can't get what I was asking for what you what would I oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good um what these clothing and that's what I was trying to tell her to is\nGet a car cash in and she sells her car and then what have at least one car for now\n... well I don't know I ... I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're going to move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the lay off in other firing until now\nBut here's the money that you've got piled the the business that you have coming should create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYes and and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are pending or clothing by then the second week of November everything should be closed a state\nLaw which is to enter you guys three weeks from now yeah I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would I Would not sell her car today I Would sell your trial today\nAnd I but I Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the ...\nI'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that out why make many I think ... that's your room mates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that so uh but uh but but the idea that I think she should keep our car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money that then the two of you could work through a budget\nThat has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth of debt making about a little over a hundred but instead has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven thousand dollars for the ... a year for two years we can keep her car but if you're not willing to do that as a household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble then\nYou know she's not willing to join armed with you and fight and outside enemy that has come at your house and instead she goes to her corner with her toys you have a marriage problem\nOkay but hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit\nYou run around started selling mama's cars not way good way to get mom on board\nHalo so let's try that other approaches I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes ... looks like your income\nSo let's try that other\nApproach 'cause I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes right looks like your income you're going to go\nThen you might be looking at different Greer and she's going to be looking at us on our core group and you get a drink or to drive you drive a car where we get this mess going into\nThis Ramsey show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I\nDon't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it there or will they never live up to the expectations the resorts saps\nAnd the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally I'm forever is with timeshare exit team they have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've exploited thousands of timeshare owners this year alone\nThey're the best in the business because they simply a more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit teams so confident in their acts of service that if they don't get your out you get a full refund called eight for for nine nine nine ... and schedule a free consultation eight for for nine nine nine or ... or timeshare exit team dot com\nWho do you call if you find in injured animal\nThe people who carried the Coconino county humane association they provide twenty four\nHour ambulance service for any seriously injured stray animal they offer low income programs that makes pay and neutering services affordable for everyone then there's this assistance with last pet if your dog or cat is missing call this shelter to see if there's any information\nGot by with a picture of your pet and that led to posted and help you with your search if you're looking to add a new member of your family\nStopped by you'll find a wonderful selection of\nLoving cats and dogs that have been vaccinated against rabies and checked for good health it's no wonder the Coconino county humane association was voted the past like agency in northern Arizona from education to adoption the the people who are there for you and your pets for over fifty\nYears the Coconino county humane association off butler in Flagstaff calm nine to five to six one zero seven\nSix long ago you wouldn't think of ... hours flooding calligraphy\nAnd you wouldn't have attempted to rise are by far typing a letter\nSafely operate a multi ton vehicle\nThe wheel and no place in Manhattan\nIf you want and give me ... ... now and to actually live depend on a\nVisit ...

N. A. S. G. W. show in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that's the national association of sporting goods wholesalers\nWho is that well a lot of people know about the shots show and that's a show where manufactures gun makers trigger makers optics ... calls pretty much anything have you with the hunting or shooting or even law enforcement world\nOr do they demonstrate their products to Detroiters with any asked you Debbie show is different hits for sporting goods wholesalers and there are only thirty thirty five companies\nThat are the wholesalers or distributors and those are the ones that work in what is called these two step distribution business now that's kind of inside baseball stuff but all it means is that your local gun store doesn't or directly from the gun maker\nUm you know there are a number of them around the country so love to get your reports on that [noise] okay let me find the story because this one was interesting to to to do this was\nGoing to make sure I start at the beginning [noise] what's new is old again we're told his new again the gun ban industry has\nI Would say rediscovered but all they they just bring back the stuff that never give up when you think oh yeah okay they're off that they're never off of banning\nAnything they just switched to the thing that they think they can get the moment well it turns out for whatever reason it crushed me on this they coordinate their back to ammunition why would they do that well they're saying well you know\nWe may not be able to ban guns but without any I mean they shouldn't have guns won't be any good they won't be able to do anything okay\nAnd then they start it's it's interesting how they'll start with the premise like that well if we could just regulate the ammunition and of course they've done a lot of states where you have to have a license debate to buy ammunition which is nuts [noise] the idea being well we'll get to the the endgame of is just a second\n\nBut there I what they say is where we need to pay an ammunition or we need to regulate the ammunition or we need to make it harder to buy him a nation or we need to make sure that you have a background check or we need to make sure that you're Twenty one years old or we need to make sure that you have a license\nBefore you can buy any nation and they're thinking is simple as well once people have guns have guns forever but they shoot up there and and they have to replenish it once they replenish yet\nIf they can't than their gun is basically a blunt objects club and it's not really a functioning fire so why don't we go after the animal and then I started seeing these\nThings where they said we'll ammo a ammunition to think about it is um it's ... units a consumable and of course it has a show are short shelf life\nWhich went went oh excuse me do my Scooby Doo thing here what short shelf life\nI think there's and I think we probably no that's not true but I think they're doing that in order to move the needle on the media the media doesn't know when they never\nThey never say was that correct they really do swallow with the gun ban lobby gives them without ever asking for clarification or confirmation or to find out if it's actually true and of course I guess\nWhat would be short ... short shelf life to me that would be a year or two when in fact the ammunition is good for decades if you store and it cool dry environment of fifty years maybe a hundred years it's OK certainly fifty years is not an issue\nI don't consider a half a century is short\nOr in a cool dry environment of fifty years maybe a hundred years it's OK certainly fifty years is\nNot an issue I don't consider a half a century is short shelf life\nBut their idea here's where I get to let me explain they always have their this is what we say why we're doing it this is the why\nBut it's never really the truth\nBecause they said well you know we can regulate guns by limiting access to him initially it's not really what's going on what's really going on what you look at the long game is if we can make it really\nMore difficult to go through the process if we can make it more cumbersome\nIf we can make it more challenging to buy ammunition\nIf we can make it where it's just a royal pain in the rear some people may be a lot of people will simply say you know I don't want to do this anymore\nI don't want to go get photographed fingerprinted to have a background check to buy a box of twenty two\n... I'm Out that's the bottom line is they want to make it so difficult so Horner is so much of a hassle but people will start\nBasically backing out and you know I don't know I'm going to play golf I'm I'm just not going to do this anymore I'm not going to subject myself to the city more I have a good person I I'm just not going to do it we're cool they go [laughter] that's great\nBecause the fewer

and killed a bunch of people not only did he four Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's aren't going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and it needs to stop\nAnd Louis continued to\nClose the more you got to stop bogus asylum claims and basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from\nAnd also we need to\nRemember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not married and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so ...

talking to Jeff and I won't even know who these types of who you're talking about Jeff Sessions suggests that should've been buddies that means\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning anything\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been this slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nIs that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve the ... gene point advantage that the American people will realize their mistake electing trumpeter Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argue against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason\nThe two thousands actually midterms the American people were all of a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't believe it\nBut we got maybe a narratives that a gigantic blue way of what's going to happen\nAnd we had that media narrative go on from December last year\nAll the way through September of this year and then and then the generic mammal started type thing and\nThen it began to look maybe it won't be as big a blue wave\nAnd Republicans look like they might actually gain seats in the Senate\nAnd oh no now the president's approval numbers is higher than it ever been CNN's on poll forty four percent Rasmussen has trumpet fifty one\nThere is nothing happening that suggests St blue wave is happening I frankly don't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth I eat election day\nPeople have to start revealing in these mad ... productions and projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they can for the sake of their business\nThere in the polling business they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all of that the case who would hire them\nSo now we're told well there's been a shift a little bit and it may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways that Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republican to hold the house foreign ways they could lose the house\nWith a month ago there was no way the Republicans were going to hold outs now all of a sudden we're starting to see it as a blue wave may not\nI don't think they ever did I don't think you'd ever did exist\nI think it made up manufactured you've got to pull result you want depending on when you take the pole and who you decide to put in your sample\n\nThere is no way\nThere is simply no way that a political party openly promoting this invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive landslide when\nThe American people are not angry that we have not\n\nStopped this the American people in mass are not wanting more illegal immigration\nThe American people in a majority no matter how you slice an are not asking for a political party\nTo stop paying attention to the border and let everybody who wants to them in the American people are not there the American people never have been there the Democratic party is there and the Democratic party wants you to think a lot of Americans are there but they aren't\n\nDon't do your own poll wherever you hang around do you think we ought to basically eliminate the border let anybody wants to come in and I can guarantee you less than ten percent of the people are going to say yes and yet\nThey look at a drive by news media every day and you would get the impression is a lot of Americans that a lot of people to support this idea\nOf these are so poor people there Thursday hungry we'd be we have so much they have so little we must what the that's not\nThe position it's going to win elections if it were or we would have had amnesty back in two thousand two\n\nIf that was the position of a majority American people Donald Trump won it never gotten the Republican nomination\nIf the people of this country wanted mobs of seven thousand or eight thousand to be admitted in the country no questions asked to be granted asylum Trump wanna never got the nomination he certainly would not have been elected president so you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think we'd go stuck\nKnow what Trump was wrong we don't need a wall this proves we just need to let these people in that's the way to stop the chaos they want and let them in we should feed them we should house than they have nothing to report are coming from ... separate countries let them that's not\nTo stop the chaos they won and let them in we should feed them we should house than they have nothing there toward are coming from ... countries let them that's not a majority opinion of the United states the beat it is going to try to make people who think that way I look like they're mean spirited cold hearted heartless and all this but it's not the case\n\nThat's not an accurate description of the American people so I none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever that Trump is in\nTrouble because he wants to build a wall that he's in trouble and the Republicans are because they want to secure the border\n\nAnd yet the media reliably very subtly at this point sympathizing with the people on the quote unquote caravan trying to find a way to make Trump look like the bad guy here\nAnd

exceptional in Minnesota Keith Ellison is crazy ring the whole Democratic Party now Amy ... is in a seven point race she was not too long ago in a in a\nIn a landslide victory situation that\nWas so secure and that she wasn't even going to have\nTo spend any money now her lead is down to seven how sleep is only down three\nThe governor's race two points and Ellison Keith Ellison who is ... looks like he's going to lose by more than seven points and this guy says he's getting reports them on the ground in Minneapolis and throughout the state that Randy areas are turning out in droves once again Republican\nEarly voting is through the roof and nobody predicted this the Democrats own early voting and the Republicans so far\nOn it and all over the country it looks like and this was a stunner this is something people have not seen and nobody predicted this in Nevada Dean Heller now on track to win by thirty five thousand votes California thirty nine California forty eight California forty nine absentees\nAll three seats would be safe Antonio Sabato is up or two points in his district of California's even got places pockets\nWhere Republicans are looking good to Arizona Republicans up over Democrats twelve point four percent\nThat's up three point nine percent over two thousand sixty in the ah Arizona want a democratic seat is now close all of these thought to be Democrat locks just a month ago are now toss ups\nAnd this guy says to me I think we're in a position here to actually gain a couple of house seats maybe seven to nine Senate seats\nAt this rate if these kinds of trends and it's all based on polling data that continues now you might be Russia was this guy here in this anywhere I Know you're not hearing anything where that's the point\nWe doesn't matter what is the fact that I'm are laying it to you is all you need to know that that that I'm taking it somewhat seriously ... at least to the point that it's interesting I'm not endorsing any of this folks I don't I'm not familiar enough with the data myself\nI just have instincts and I I ... process information like everybody else and I'm just telling you\nI I don't know how things are going to end up but I Do know that none of this is the way the Democrats and the media thought this was going to play out\nThere isn't any blue wave and even they are beginning to pull back from that now even they are beginning to admit that there isn't one\nAnd it could be big trouble um\nWall Street journal poll Politico these kinds of places are pulling\nIt was at one and it could be big trouble um\nNBC Wall Street Journal poll Politico these kinds of places are pulling back from it I don't think there ever was going to be a blue wave this is my point I think we've been lied to we've had a media soap opera narrative that has been part of the effort to defeat Trump at Republicans for the last year\nStarting with the generic ballot last December so uh it it ... regardless however the Democrats are telling the story themselves however they're lying or whatever\nIt isn't it isn't unfolding as they expected they expected to be able to make a blue wave happen just by predicting it just by talking about and just by reporting stories made the looked like it was happening quick time out we will continue your phone calls on the other side [noise]\n[noise] [noise] we you know Russia always meant to be talking\nMy friends I enjoy things that are well made take cigars for example the details are what matter a proper assembly properly rolling the cigar is central for a good draw the feel and to look at a rapper has to be just right\nWell details also matter when it comes to home security and simply say from security pays attention to the details it's evident in their use of tech and craftsmanship\nTheir focus on creating the most reliable security for your family shows in the details simply say centers are small they don't destroy the look at your home the system is easy to set up a news\nThey made sure that it works even in the event of power outages are downed wires and unlike other home security companies simply safe never asked you to sign a contract\nSee how good

candidate for state representative I work for target\nFor thirty or I don't want them going to jail but the threat of jail is the number one reason my addicted patients get treat my patients often say the getting arrested was the best thing that ever happened because they couldn't stop on their own\nTough drug laws do save lives but my opponent David Stringer of legislation to weaken Arizona has struggled to terrible idea here's what Mr stringer doesn't get\nMost addicts just want to get high they don't want treatment for use tough drug laws to put them in treatment and keep them there they wake up to what they've been doing\nPatience telling me they hated treatment at first but save their lives stringers plan to weaken our drug laws would cost lives and make the opioid crisis horse

generation for over one hundred years\n[noise]\n\nHere's another story this from Bloomberg News falls could be missing a Republican syringe\nHere's why certainly looks like Democrats will do well in the midterms but the cycle present some unusual risks for pollsters not ... the mainstream media does this every election cycle\nWhere does all this out for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave and there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep\nThe Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump and that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months drive buys a shoring\nEverybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's got to be curtains for Trump curtains from other Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge\nLate surge and guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen Hillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys mislaid change the story written before the bombs\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are back firing they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the Swedes here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously have set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats the step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then ...\nThere's a translation for this in addition to what he's saying here you Democrats have got to stop up posing Trump just to oppose Trump\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people\nThat are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know of has to be true and now we we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela sponsored and pay for it is if that if that's true\nThen Venezuela also means Iran and the ...\nSmokes a\nLot of people in our size have jumped say George Soros yeah maybe but if Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying is Venezuela if it's Venezuela\nIt's also Iran and the ... regardless we had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates didn't let those people in for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not where the American people are right now\nThe only common sense a cool thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that demented what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against it therefore ... he is saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security just doesn't help us a mob of seven thousand ten thousand people starving to gauge demanding to be let in that doesn't help us\nWhatever not to say oh this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickled kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\n[noise] my point is [laughter] none of this is panning out the way it was planned no blue wave\nI look don't misunderstand I don't know what's good I'm not saying that the Democrats may not win the house but I I don't think they're going to [noise] I I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it because I never fall for the left wing media conventional wisdom\nOr the standard ordinary groupthink narrative of the moment whenever it is\nBut it's more than that there's nothing happening in America right now than argues electing Democrats\nNot in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in mass\nThere's no reason to vote Democrat even giving people reasons to vote for the all they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump because Trump what he's aboard he tweets he's a bad guy is whatever whatever is\nThe stunts the Democrats are pulling destroying Kevin on his family sending rice in what looked like rice in the Susan Collins all these monsters nothing the Democrats are doing\nThat's the kind of thing you do to build a movement in a decent society and I still believe that we have one\nI Believe are decent society is under siege everyday are decent society standard good old normalcy is under assault everyday led by pop culture and leftist in Hollywood\nIn Silicon valley and the drive by media where under assault every day but they have not overturned it yet they have not\nTo the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced normal there's just nothing out there to me\nThat would have people excited about voting for Democrats because the the even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people to vote against Trump against Republicans\nAh I just I don't see it we'll find out if my instincts are off the charts you're not\nIn less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters they're the ones panicking so you flip this scenario what\nSense does it make for a conservative Republican the gum up the works here by sending a bunch of bombs that are not going to go off and that are going to be discovered\nDoesn't make any sense\nAny way shape or form a yup break time back with more after this\nHang on Russia's always at work and he I have never closes Fifteen hours a week here what is there
